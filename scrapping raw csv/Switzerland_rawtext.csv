2021-02-06;A candle on the coronavirus cake;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/a-candle-on-the-coronavirus-cake/46348672;From January 2020 until today, the world has been in the grips of to a tiny organism, invisible to the naked eye. Raise your hand if you could imagine a year ago how much our lives would change. About a year ago, on January 20, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the new coronavirus to be “a public health emergency of international concern”External link. At the time, there were less than ten thousand cases worldwide and no deaths outside China. A year later, we are still in the midst of a global pandemic that has taken the lives of more than two million people and infected more than 100 million. The figures certainly do not compare with the terrible Spanish fluExternal link of the early 20th century, which has been dug up over the past year from the dusty drawers of history to remind us that history often repeats itself. At the beginning of the health emergency, well after 30 January, many politicians and experts had underestimated SARS-CoV-2, branding it as a “simple” flu or even a “measly cold”External link . The thinly veiled message was that there was nothing to worry about. Can “a flu” send the world into a tailspin in the 21st century? A year ago it was not thought possible. Now the answer would be a clear “yes”. My colleague Marc-André MiserezExternal link looked back on his experience as a journalist in the midst of a health crisis, recalling how the initial certainties of a year ago have crumbled in the face of the reality of the galloping epidemic. Here’s Marc-André, and the questions I put to him about this moment of self-reflection. Is the world right to be afraid of the Wuhan coronavirus? . By asking the question in early February 2020 - without even saying so - I was sure I had the answer. Arrogance! I should have remembered that you can never be sure of anything.  Marc André, as a journalist, how did you experience those first weeks of February, when the fear of the virus was beginning to mount? At the time, no cases had yet been registered in Switzerland - the first one will be declared on 25 February - but there were already concerns. In medical circles, as well as in newsrooms. At swissinfo.ch we were in the midst of the debate. Convey fears to readers? Or rather reassure? Should we wait and see what happens? We are journalists. Our duty is to inform. With a certain bravado, I volunteered to see if I could write something about it. What did you do then? I contacted an epidemiologist, who told me honestly what he knew. Which is to say, not much. The new virus was easily transmitted, but its mortality rate was estimated at around 4% - today it's more like 2%. According to the WHO, the mortality rate was 9.5% for SARS in 2003/2004 and 34% for MERS in 2012. Both of these global coronavirus epidemics caused the death of less than a thousand people each. That is between 300 and 600 times less than influenza, which returns every year. And these figures reassured you... Yes, the comparison was reassuring. All the more so because the mortality rate is always lower than the statistics suggest, because there are usually far fewer declared cases than actual ones... But I should have remembered that the comparison is misleading. So you changed your mind? Of course, today there is no doubt. Covid-19 is indeed a global scourge. And the comparison with the 50-100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu of 1918-20 does not work: in a century, health systems have made significant progress globally. Moreover, never before has a virus caused so much damage to the economy and society, depriving millions of people of their livelihood, or even reason to live, as only wars can do. To err is human, to persevere is diabolical. If you could go back, what would you say to your readers then and, perhaps, now? I would tell them that yes, the world was right to fear the Wuhan coronavirus! And to the 140,000 or so people who read my article a year ago, I owe a humble apology: I was very wrong. Personally, I don't remember taking a clear position at the beginning of the epidemic. As an Italian transplanted abroad (I was living in Paris at the time), I was in a sort of limbo, between the paradox of the rapidly worsening Italian situation and the placid French indifference. In Paris, people began to realise very late that the situation was getting serious. By a strange coincidence, the days were mild and sunny in the City of Light and no one wanted to miss the opportunity for a picnic in Les Tuileries or a coup on the terrace of some café. Of course, there were those who knew best and predicted the impending catastropheExternal link. The head of Moderna, Stéphane Bancel, had already realised in January that the virus was starting to travel everywhere. On 24 February, Moderna sent the first clinical samples of its vaccine to the US Department of Health. And you? How did you experience the beginning of the pandemic? If you were to go back, would you do or laugh at the same things? Let's talk about it! Write meExternal link your comments. The virus wastes no time While the world agreed on the seriousness of the situation and the measures to be taken, the virus wasted no time. From one contagion to the next, it was modifying small parts of its genetic code to continue reproducing and infecting new (or even old) victims. Genomic epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Bern, has been following the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and tells us in an interview how the virus has mutated and become more and more contagious: from a scientific point of view, the evolution of the virus is completely normal. But every time the virus replicates, there is a chance that an error will occur, and that this will generate a mutation. The longer we play this game, with a high number of cases and a high concentration of the virus in circulation, the greater the chance that the next mutation will be one we don't want to see. That's why, according to Emma Hodcroft, it's very important to keep infections low and not give the virus space. British epidemiologist Adam Kucharski also confirmed in an article in the Financial TimesExternal link that an accumulation of mutations has the potential to dramatically change the face of the pandemic and the threat it faces. For the worse. Vaccine race and digitisation Vaccines could be a real game-changer in curbing the virus, but the vaccination campaign is proceeding slowly in Switzerland, due to delays in delivering doses. But this is not the case for everyone. Israel, similar to Switzerland in terms of population, is the first countryExternal link in terms of the number of vaccines administered per capita. Why? One of the determining factors is certainly the efficiency of its digitised healthcare systemExternal link. In Switzerland, however, the digitisation of healthcare is far from being a reality. And this could cost the population dearly. I will talk about this in a forthcoming article, which you’ll find on swissinfo.ch. Stay tuned! Do you have an opinion? Let's talk about itExternal link over a (virtual) coffee.
2021-02-05;Alpine resorts offer mass Covid tests to stem new outbreaks ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/alpine-resorts-offer-mass-covid-tests-to-stem-new-outbreaks-/46347842;The western Swiss canton of Vaud has become the latest to launch mass Covid-19 testing, with a pilot scheme in its three biggest ski resorts.  Starting on Friday, the canton is offering free, voluntary testing in the run-up to a week of school holidays starting February 20. The campaign kicks off in the resort of Villars-sur-Ollon (which by 4PM had done almost 400 tests, four of which were positive), and will then come to Les Diablerets and Leysin.  Tests are being offered to anyone over 12 years of age, including non-residents.  The aim is to “save the end of the ski season”, according to Vaud authorities, and to avoid coronavirus clusters as happened in Verbier in December. Verbier is in neighbouring canton Valais, which is expected to follow suit with testing.   Switzerland has kept its ski resorts open despite the pandemic and despite this causing tension with some neighbouring countries.  Ski resorts have been targeted because “they are going to see a lot of mixing of people in the next few weeks”, Vaud government leader Nuria Gorrite told public broadcaster RTS on Thursday. “We want to avoid the virus being transported from one place to another. What the resorts need least is to become national clusters!”  Other regions and ski resorts have already introduced similar measures. These include the southeastern canton of Graubunden and the resort of Wengen in canton Bern, where the iconic Lauberhorn ski race had to be cancelledExternal link because of coronavirus fears.    
2021-02-05;Swiss to boost ‘laptop’ diplomat network;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-to-boost--laptop--diplomat-network/46347752;Switzerland is to send more diplomatic staff abroad after the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the need for more personnel on the ground, Swiss public television SRF reported. The first year of the pandemic has shown that there were too few staff in some representations abroad, the Federal Council (Swiss government) said in its report on foreign policy for 2020, which it approved earlier this weekExternal link. Currently the country has around 170 embassies, consulates and representations around the world. “The plan is to redeploy 35 people from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) central office [in the Swiss capital Bern] to the network abroad over the next four years,” the FDFA told SRFExternal link on Friday. The Swiss diplomatic network was highly useful during the corona pandemic, added the FDFA, helping to bring more than 7,000 people back to Switzerland last year, in the largest repatriation operation in Switzerland’s history. The network also ensured that Swiss aid reached countries hard hit by the pandemic, the FDFA said.   Smaller representations – often made up of one ambassador with a few local employees and known as “laptop embassies” – are expected to benefit the most from staff redeployment. “They must be able to remain operational, even if a crisis like the current pandemic persists,” the FDFA wrote. The move marks a turnaround, SRF said, as it comes after a period of cost-cutting that has left some Swiss representations abroad “reduced to the minimum”. This brought criticism in 2019 from the country’s Federal Audit Office, which said it left smaller embassies “without a clear profile”. The Federal Audit Office at the time recommended a review of the portfolio of embassies.
2021-02-05;Pandemic brings more threats against Swiss politicians  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-brings-more-threats-against-swiss-politicians--/46347474;Hate speech and insults are on the rise in Switzerland, especially towards politicians, reports national broadcaster RTS.  The federal police received more than 1,200 reports of threats or insults against government members and federal parliamentarians last year, compared with only 250 in 2019. The majority of the threats were made on social media networks.  “The coronavirus situation is hard for everyone and there is a tendency for people to express that dissatisfaction,” federal police spokeswoman Cathy Maret told RTS on Thursday evening.   Federal police are taking new steps to try to counter this trend, including sending warning letters. “The aim of these letters is to calm things down,” said Maret. “People go online and the atmosphere is aggressive. They get het up and sometimes forget they are in a public space. If they get a warning letter, that often calms them down.”  A survey conducted for RTS in 2019, before the pandemic, found that almost 60% of Swiss politicians receive threats on a regular basis and over three-quarters are routinely insulted, with female politicians at greatest risk.  
2021-02-05;‘The virus is always evolving’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_-the-virus-is-always-evolving-/46341598;"Should we be afraid of virus variants? Will vaccines be effective against these new virus forms? Emma Hodcroft, a genomic epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Bern, discusses mutations and how vaccines are developed. Covid-19 variants worry scientists and governments – with good reason. According to British-American epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, it is essential to keep infections low and contain the spread of variants. Though mutations are a normal part of virus life, in rare cases, they can generate much more dangerous variants. SWI swissinfo.ch: What do we know about these mutations? Emma Hodcroft: There are three main variants that are attracting scientists' attention at the moment. A fourth variant is making headlines, but scientists don't know how much of a concern it is yet. The variants are mainly found in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and two others have appeared in Brazil. The one circulating in Britain is the first one that was discovered. From the data we have, it is spreading locally in most European countries. This variant is causing concern because it is more contagious and therefore more difficult to manage than, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 variants that were circulating this summer. Although there is no clear indication that it is more dangerous or lethal, the more people that get infected and get sick, the more the stress this is adding to the health care system. This is what we are seeing in the UK. We have less information on the other variants. The variant in South Africa shares a common mutation with the UK one. It has an additional mutation that is of particular concern to scientists. The two variants circulating in Brazil also have this mutation. According to some studies, this variant is transmitted much faster, but we still do not have enough data to be certain. What is really alarming is that the additional mutation could make the virus capable of re-infecting people who have already contracted SARS-CoV-2. And this of course could also affect the effectiveness of vaccines. The good news is that that recent data released by Moderna suggests that the vaccine response to these mutations is still good enough to work. SWI: Does this mean that mutations could affect the vaccines? EH: Even if vaccines become less effective, it is unlikely that they would stop working altogether. The issue is that efficacy could drop from 95% to 85-90%. Experience with other pathogens has shown that the immune response you get from vaccines is better than the naturally generated response. Vaccines are better at teaching our bodies how to defend themselves. If this is true with SARS-CoV-2, then it could be that this mutation doesn't affect vaccines at all – or only to a small degree. From the recent Moderna data, it seems this is the case.SWI: Do these mutations worry you? EH: From a scientific perspective, the evolution of the virus is completely normal and there is nothing surprising about it. The issue is that every time the virus replicates, there is a chance that an error will occur, and that this will generate a mutation. The longer we play this game, the higher the odds are that the next mutation will be one we don't want to see. We will never be able to rule out such as scenario, or prevent it entirely, unless we wipe the virus off the face of the earth. However, we can certainly reduce the possibility by making sure that the virus has less access to unusual situations or people who don't have good immune systems. That is where the virus finds a favorable playing field. We shouldn't underestimate the lesson we've learned in recent months: even if something is unlikely, it doesn't mean it won't happen. The longer we give the virus space, the more risk we take that the next mutation will be bad news. It's important to remember that the virus is always evolving, and although the vast majority of these mutations are harmless, it's in our best interest to keep the number of cases as low as possible. SWI: In the media these variants are referred to as British or South African. Is this where they came from? How do scientists study the origins of mutations? EH: It is really hard not to use these geographical names because they have entered everyday and media use and it is often the clearest way to identify variants. For our part, we avoid using them as much as possible because they can severely damage the reputation of these countries. In addition, they are not entirely appropriate because it is difficult to know for sure where the mutations originated. What we can say with some degree of certainty is that the variant present in the UK, for example, may not have originated there but grew there. The high number of sequences found and the spread across the UK seem to suggest that it spread there rather than elsewhere in Europe. For Brazil and South Africa, it is more difficult to determine the origin of the mutations. These are not isolated countries like Great Britain, but they border other countries. South Africa does quite well with sequencing, but many of its neighbors are unable to. As such, we do not know if the mutation happened in another southern African state and was then detected in South Africa. The situation is even more complex in South America because Brazil and its neighbours don’t have good sequencing capabilities. SWI: Is it important from a scientific point of view to know the exact origin of a mutation? EH: Yes, it is important to know which environments could favor certain mutations and to act to stop their spread. For example, in an environment where there are many infections, the virus gains an advantage from the mechanism of reinfection. That advantage is minimal where cases are low. From this perspective, it is relevant to understand how different environments can stimulate the production of these variants. SWI: Do you think cases of the so-called British variant could explode in Switzerland as they have in the UK? Are stricter measures necessary? EH: The British variant is already circulating in Switzerland and we should prepare for the fact that the situation could get worse. That's why to stop the trend, it's very important to keep infections down. It is a strategy from which we can only benefit, because if we manage to contain it, then we can stop the spread. On the other hand, if we fail to contain it but still get cases down, we can spare our healthcare system from being overloaded – which means it will be able to respond if the situation gets worse. We don't want to end up with a severely strained system and ambulance queues outside hospitals, as has been the case in the UK. SWI: Has the fight against the virus become a race against time? EH: I wouldn't look at it from that point of view. It's unlikely that we're going to be able to vaccinate the population faster than the variant spreads. Rather, until the whole population can be vaccinated, we need to focus on keeping cases down through social distancing and hygiene. SWI: Are the concerns against the vaccine justified? EH: A lot of concerns have arisen about how quickly these vaccines have been developed. Many have heard that it normally takes five to ten years to get a vaccine on the market. First of all, it’s important to clarify that many of the vaccines approved had already been developed for other viruses, in some cases for other coronaviruses. We are not starting from scratch. Second, what lengthens the time to develop a vaccine is not the science, but the bureaucracy around it. A big part of a scientist's job is finding funding, writing reports, and convincing enough volunteers to enroll in trials of new vaccines. All of this makes the process long and difficult. The coronavirus pandemic has eliminated many of these problems. Governments gave money and provided infrastructure very quickly and an incredible number of people wanted to test the vaccines. Science was not quicker; bureaucracy was. These vaccines were tested even more thoroughly than most because there were so many volunteers. This is a testament to where science can go when there is cooperation among all interest groups. Another concern among the population is the long-term effects. Vaccines stay in the body long enough to teach the immune system how to fight a certain virus, and then they disappear. This is why they have very few side effects and are much less dangerous than the virus in a natural infection, because they are not infectious and therefore do not cause organ damage, as we have seen in the case of the coronavirus. SWI: What lessons does this pandemic teach us for the future? EH: It teaches us that we still know too little about viruses. Much research has focused on influenza viruses and HIV, but the importance of coronaviruses, and other viruses, has been underestimated. There are thousands of viruses out there and we don't know when the next pandemic will come. I hope that what is happening now will help raise awareness of the importance of virus research. "
2021-02-04;Fewer foreigners arrive in Switzerland during pandemic year;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fewer-foreigners-arrive-in-switzerland-during-pandemic-year/46344942;While the overall number of foreigners in the country increased in 2020, the number of new arrivals fell.  The coronavirus crisis has had an impact on annual immigration figures, according to figures released by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) on Thursday.  Arrivals who are registered as permanent residents (136,962) decreased by 2.6% compared with 2019. Immigration of temporary residents from abroad (77,539) fell by 23.5%.   While immigration increased in the first quarter of 2020 owing to a good economic outlook, it fell in the second quarter, the SEM said. Protective measures to contain the pandemic was largely to blame. In the third and fourth quarters the lifting of restrictions had a catch-up effect, particularly in terms of student arrivals.  Fewer foreigners left the country despite Switzerland experiencing a relatively high number of coronavirus infections compared with other parts of the world.   A total of 70,270 permanent foreign residents left the Alpine nation last year, 12.1% less than in 2019. An emigration drop of 14.1% was recorded for non-permanent residents, with 55,885 departures.  At the end of 2020 over two million (2,151,854) foreign nationals were resident in Switzerland, an increase of 1.9% compared with 2019. Almost 1.5 million were EU/EFTA and UK nationals and fewer than 700,000 were from third countries. Switzerland has a total population of 8.6 million as of 2019. 
2021-02-04;Teachers’ association wants nationwide Covid testing in Swiss schools;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/teachers--association-wants-nationwide-covid-testing-in-swiss-schools/46344770;The Swiss Teachers’ Association is demanding coronavirus tests be extended to schools across the whole of Switzerland. The federal government has rejected the idea, saying cantons have sovereignty regarding education. Cantons Basel Country, Zug and Graubünden have already said they intend to start mass coronavirus testing in schools. “The pandemic affects the whole of Switzerland and schools throughout the country must be closed,” Dagmar Rösler, president of the teachers’ association, told Swiss public radioExternal link, SRF, on Thursday. “Therefore, nationwide mass testing and national coordination would also make sense.” The teachers’ association has been concerned for some time about infections in schools, she said, adding that if classroom teaching were to be maintained, additional preventive and protective measures must be taken. In canton Zug, students and teachers at secondary and baccalaureate schools will have to undergo a saliva test twice a week from February 22. If these large-scale tests are effective, the operation could be extended to vocational schools. Basel Country plans to test 50,000 people every week until July in schools, companies, hospitals and the cantonal administration. The aim is to detect as many people as possible who are infected but who are asymptomatic. So far, only canton Graubünden has conducted large-scale tests. These have been carried out on a voluntary basis, notably in some schools. The canton announced on Thursday that it would extend this programme from March, carrying out saliva tests in schools at a regional level, again on a voluntary basis.
2021-02-04;How are young dancers coping with the video edition of the Prix de Lausanne?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-are-young-dancers-coping-with-the-video-edition-of-the-prix-de-lausanne-/46344540;"The 49th edition of the prestigious Prix de Lausanne international ballet competition began last Sunday. But due to the pandemic this year’s event is taking place by video. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a format? Airi Kobayashi, a 15-year-old from Japan, started to dance when she was six. A huge fan of the French ballet star Sylvie Guillem, her dream is to become a professional ballet dancer. This year Airi was preselected to take part in the Prix de Lausanne for the first time. But the young Japanese dancer will not be travelling to the Swiss lakeside city, like in normal years, to show off her skills; instead she will participate from Tokyo. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the organisers had to rethink the format of this year's ballet competition and decided to create a special video edition. Selected candidates had to send pre-recorded videos of their performances of classical and contemporary variations at their ballet school or studio. The change of format was decided to protect the dancers from catching the virus. But it also meant that the financial burden of taking part, such as travel and accommodation costs, was much lower, and the videos could be reshot if necessary. Rui Ceser Cruz, an 18-year-old dancer from Brazil, took part in the 2020 ballet competition. This year’s edition is “challenging in a different way”, he said. The dancers can create their own work and ideas, but they do not get the same guidance in Lausanne as in previous years. It is very difficult to perfect an individual choreography and adjust subtle body movements, especially for contemporary dance. Airi, who danced Bow , choreographed by Goyo Montero, was frustrated: There is a part in the piece where I make my fingers look like Avalokitesvara [Buddhist bodhisattva], and I wanted to ask him directly what that meant. The performance is without an audience. You don't even feel the stage space.” In a hotel in Lausanne, nine jury members will spend 100 hours carefully examining the videos submitted by the 78 candidates, starting with the youngest dancers. The judges’ criteria for choosing the best dancers have not changed from previous years. The performances will also be livestreamed. But the atmosphere this year is totally different. In the quiet of the jury room, there is none of usual lively cheering from fellow dancers and their rivals. Despite the difficult coronavirus situation, the Prix de Lausanne still represents a chance for young dancers to show ballet schools and companies the results of their hard work and their dedication to becoming a top dancer. The timing of the competition is a perfect opportunity for young dancers to find a place to study before spring. Kathryn Bradney, the artistic and executive director of the Prix de Lausanne, explained that the format of this year’s competition allows partner ballet schools and companies to “take the time to look at each dancer's video and make a career offer . Richard Wherlock, director and head choreographer of the Basel Ballet and jury president for this year's competition, said that the young dancers may have spent a year not being able to perform, not being able to go to class, and having to dance in restricted areas and not in their dance studio . The Lausanne competition's video format therefore gives dancers who only have short careers a chance to show themselves , he said."
2021-02-04;Charity collects huge donations for Swiss Covid victims;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/charity-collects-huge-donations-for-swiss-covid-victims/46343952;The humanitarian charity Swiss Solidarity collected more than CHF43 million ($47.7 million) in donations last year for victims of the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland. This is the largest amount since the CHF50 million collected after a devastating storm in 2005. The humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, SWI swissinfo.ch’s parent company, together with private media collected a total of CHF64.5 million for aid worldwide, Swiss Solidarity said in a statementExternal link on Thursday. “In 2020, we proved once again that Swiss Solidarity can also help right here at home thanks to the generosity of the people of Switzerland and the support of trustworthy partners and organisations,” said director Roland Thomann. In Switzerland 1.7 million people received support in the form of financial aid, services and food aid. Swiss Solidarity launched its coronavirus support campaign in March, the largest and longest fundraising campaign for the Swiss population since 2005. Swiss Solidarity said it supported 409 projects of its partner relief organisations in 41 countries, including Switzerland, to help people affected by humanitarian crises, conflicts, violence and natural disasters. Two-thirds of the donations went to help people in need in Switzerland. Abroad, one focus of fundraising was Lebanon, following a devastating explosion in a port in Beirut in August. For this, donations were given worth CHF7.5 million. Funds also went to ongoing projects for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and to projects in Indonesia following the earthquake and tsunami in 2018. Since 1946 Swiss Solidarity has collected more than CHF1.8 billion in donations.
2021-02-03;WEF forced to postpone Singapore meeting to August;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wef-forced-to-postpone-singapore-meeting-to-august/46342026;The World Economic Forum’s special annual meeting – exceptionally being held in Singapore this year – has been pushed back by three months. The WEF conference will now convene from August 17-20. The coronavirus pandemic forced WEF to relocate its flagship event from the Swiss mountain resort of Davos to the Southeast Asian city state. It will be only the second time in 50 years that it will be staged outside Davos. The 51st annual meeting of business, political and civil society leaders will now take place in Singapore between August 17-20 instead of May 25-28, WEF announced on Wednesday. The meeting follows the success of the forum’s virtual Davos Agenda in January. The WEF said in a statementExternal link that although the forum and the government of Singapore remained confident of the measures in place to ensure a safe and effective meeting, and local transmission of Covid-19 in Singapore remained at negligible levels, “the change to the meeting’s timing reflects the international challenges in containing the pandemic”. Current global travel restrictions had made planning difficult for an in-person meeting in the first half of the year, it added. “Furthermore, differing quarantine and air transport regulations have increased the lead time necessary to ensure that participants globally can make arrangements to join.” “A global leadership summit needs the participation of all global stakeholders,” said Klaus Schwab, WEF founder and executive chairman.
2021-02-03;Government rules out early end to Covid restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-rules-out-early-end-to-covid-restrictions/46341368;Interior Minister Alain Berset says Switzerland is unlikely to ease its anti-Covid restrictions before the end of February amid fears of new strains of the virus. He also said it was not realistic to expect that the measures, in place since mid-January, would all be lifted. “The government is facing a dilemma,” he told a news conference on Wednesday. He explained that the number of confirmed cases was dropping slowly, but new variants of coronavirus posed a real risk of a third wave of infections in Switzerland. Berset also pointed out that the key reproduction value of the virus had risen above 1, fuelling concerns that the number of infections could be on the increase. “The situation is similar to early October last year,” he said. “But there is uncertainty about development in the next few weeks.” He called for people to maintain strict hygiene rules and respect the restrictions imposed by the government, notably a ban of gatherings of more than five people from more than two households. The government has decided to pay for the costs of anti-Covid vaccinations for certain cross-border workers, Swiss-based diplomats and staff at international organisations. The aim is to make vaccinations accessible for all those residents who have not taken out regular health insurance, according to the Federal Office for Public Health. Around 150,000 people are to benefit from the decision. It is expected to cost CHF3.5 million ($3.9 million). Meanwhile the government has signed additional deals with pharmaceutical companies to acquire an extra 12 million doses of anti-Covid vaccines amid supply delays. Five million doses have been secured by the German pharmaceutical company CureVac through the Swedish government and an additional six million from the US company Moderna. A preliminary agreement has also been reached with the company Novavax in the US. In total, the Swiss government has signed agreements with five vaccine manufacturers for nearly 33 million doses, but the delivery of the vaccines has been delayed. “We want to be prepared to cope with possible new variants of Covid and continue our diversification strategy,” said Nora Kronig from the health office. The medical watchdog agency, Swissmedic, on Wednesday announced that it had asked for additional information from the Swedish/British company AstraZeneca about the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine before considering giving its approval. The government ordered 5.3 million doses from AstraZeneca.
2021-02-03;Nestlé in talks with One Rock consortium on bottled water sale;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/nestl%C3%A9-in-talks-with-one-rock-consortium-on-bottled-water-sale/46340796;Nestlé is in exclusive talks with a consortium of buyers led by US private equity firm One Rock Capital to sell its North American water business, which includes the Poland Spring and Pure Life brands, for about $4 billion (CHF3.6 billion), said people briefed on the matter.  The Swiss consumer goods giant has held talks with a number of buyers since June, including large European rivals, but the US private equity group, which is working with other backers, presented the highest bid during the sale process, those people said.  It is unclear who One Rock is working with. One person briefed on the negotiations said the US private equity group was likely to sell off some of the brands immediately to other buyers.  A deal could be agreed within weeks, one person said, as the two sides were finalising the agreement. The valuation of approximately $4 billion for the division also includes debt. The talks were first reported by Reuters. Nestlé’s decision last year to review its US-based brands, which also include Deer Park, Ozarka, Ice Mountain, Zephyrhills and Arrowhead, came as sales of bottled water slumped during the coronavirus pandemic. Plastic bottles have faced an environmental backlash, while Nestlé’s use of groundwater in some US communities has prompted protests. Its lower-margin US brands have lost market share in the face of tough price competition. The Vevey-based company will continue to own its premium sparkling water brands, San Pellegrino, Perrier and Acqua Panna, including in the US. It said last year that it was “fully committed” to expanding these. The sale will significantly reduce Nestlé’s presence in the bottled water market. The brands being sold had sales of about CHF3.4 billion in 2019, more than 40% of Nestlé’s overall CHF7.8 billion of revenues from water that year. Nestlé declined to comment, while One Rock did not respond to requests for comment.  It would be a major deal for New York-headquartered One Rock, which has about $3.2 billion in assets under management across three funds and typically buys middle-market businesses, according to its website.  The private equity group was founded in 2010 and looks for companies with growth potential and room for operational improvements, the site says. It bought Newell Brands’ process solutions business, which makes plastic, nylons and zinc products, for about $500 million in 2019. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021
2021-02-03;Swiss pleasure cruiser turned into vaccine ‘shot ship’ for lakeside towns;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-pleasure-cruiser-turned-into-vaccine--shot-ship--for-lakeside-towns/46340862;An 89-year-old passenger ship, out of commission owing to the coronavirus pandemic, has been re-purposed as a Covid-19 vaccination centre for thousands of residents from towns on Lake Constance. The 500-passenger MS Thurgau normally carries tourists and commuters between Swiss and German towns on Europe’s third-largest lake. In coming weeks it will serve as a floating inoculation hub for northern Swiss towns Romanshorn, Arbon and Kreuzlingen. Regional officials emphasised the ship’s practicality since it can sail from harbour to harbour, earning it the nickname “vaccine vaporetto”, referring to Venice’s water buses, with some locals. “I’ve heard of a fondue ship and a spaghetti ship, but this is my first shot ship,” Switzerland’s Interior Minister Alain Berset told reporters on Tuesday just after the first people to be vaccinated walked the gangway. Switzerland reported just over 1,600 new infections on Tuesday, bringing its total to 526,000, with the cases of fast-spreading variants doubling every week. Nearly 8,800 people have died. Switzerland has a population of 8.6 million. Aboard MS Thurgau there are two shot stations capable of vaccinating 24 people per hour – one every five minutes – or 168 people daily during a seven-hour shift. As more vaccines arrive in Switzerland, stations can be expanded to eight. For the first week, the ship will be in Romanshorn, a historic lakeside grain trading centre, followed by two weeks in larger Kreuzlingen. After another week in nearby Arbon, the vessel will make the return voyage to Romanshorn, so those inoculated earlier can get a required booster shot. Only Moderna shots are being used aboard the MS Thurgau, since the ten-dose vials are slightly easier to prepare in the ship’s cramped quarters, medics said. The canton of Thurgau initially considered creating vaccine centres aboard buses, but eventually opted for the idled pleasure cruiser. “We wanted to figure out just how we could vaccinate as many people as possible, with as few vaccination centres as were necessary,” said Urs Martin, a Thurgau elected official. Like elsewhere in Europe, the tourism-reliant Lake Constance region has been broadsided by the pandemic. A border fence temporarily erected between adjacent towns of Konstanz in Germany and Kreuzlingen in Switzerland last year divided families, friends and lovers for weeks. The initial round of shots aboard the MS Thurgau is planned for the next 12 weeks, said Adriano Mari, leader for all of Thurgau’s vaccination centres run by private hospital group Hirslanden, a unit of South Africa-based Mediclinic. He hopes an extension beyond this maiden voyage won’t be necessary. “Hopefully by then things will have eased and the ship can return to carrying passengers on its regular route,” Mari said.
2021-02-03;Brexit explainer: visiting, studying and working in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/brexit-explainer--visiting--studying-and-working-in-switzerland/46334666;The impact of Brexit still reverberates, even in non-EU member Switzerland. From holidays to studying to finding a job in the Alpine nation, SWI swissinfo.ch looked at what has changed for UK nationals either working in Switzerland or wanting to visit since January 1, 2021. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union but has close ties with the bloc, governed by numerous bilateral agreements. The United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU orbit therefore also has consequences for Brits wanting to visit, live and work in Switzerland. Before BrexitExternal link, UK citizens benefited from Europe’s free movement of persons agreement and could travel, live, go on holiday and work anywhere in the EU and Switzerland without any special permits, restrictions or quotas. As of January 1, 2021, this is no longer the case. Can Britons freely travel to Switzerland? Switzerland imposed a flight and entry ban on travelers from the UK in late December as the new coronavirus variant started spreading. These bans were lifted from February 8External link. But Switzerland continues to classify the UK as a “high-risk country” and has imposed strict entry restrictionsExternal link. Derogations regarding entry have been allowed for Swiss citizens, holders of residence permits and special cases. When the current restrictions are lifted and trips resume, Brits will face some changes over the next two years. UK citizens who were legal residents in Switzerland or cross-border commuters before December 31, 2020, have retained European free movement rights under the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement. But those UK citizens who did not acquire these rights are now regarded as third-country nationals. Switzerland, like other EU Schengen zone states, has agreed to visa-free travel for short stays. This means that UK passport holders can visit Switzerland and other Schengen countries without a visa for up to 90 days over any 180-day period. People who take short holidays or visit relatives won’t notice much difference. The picture will be different for people who travel often or spend long periods moving around Europe. From 2022 (the exact date is yet to be confirmed), UK nationals will nonetheless have to buy a visa waiver before going on holidays and short stays in the EU and Switzerland. This is expected to cost €7 (CHF7.50) and will be issued under a European system similar to the ESTA permit currently required to visit the US. Are border controls now different for UK citizens entering Switzerland? According to the British embassy in Bern, since the start of the year, UK nationals need to use the “All passports” lane at Swiss airports, rather than the one for European Union, European Economic Area, or Swiss citizens, whether or not they hold a residence or cross-border permit. They also cannot use the e-gates anymore. “I had to bite my quivering lip when choosing the “All passports” lane at immigration last week when coming back here from Blighty,” wrote Andrew Lavender on the SWI swissinfo.ch Facebook page. The British embassy in Bern says citizens with Swiss residence permits should always carry them together with their passport (that has at least six months’ validity) when crossing Swiss and other Schengen borders. According to the UK government website,External link British visitors to Europe may also need to prove they have enough money to support themselves for the whole of their stay. They may also need to get their passport stamped and show a return or onward ticket. Travellers from the UK wanting to enter Switzerland with pets or meat and dairy products will also face stricter rules. Amanda Carr from Zurich wrote on Facebook: “Now even when we want to fly back (from the UK), we have to watch what we bring in our suitcase, i.e. no English sausages or meat allowed, plus a whole host of other restrictions.” She went on: “Amazon UK charges are now a lot more for delivery from UK to Switzerland.” As a UK national can I still get a job in Switzerland? The British embassy in Switzerland insists that if you were a legal resident in Switzerland before January 1, 2021 (around 43,000 people), you will be able to continue living your life in Switzerland “broadly as you do now”. The Citizens’ Rights Agreement agreed between both countries (see box) protects those already living and working in Switzerland before the end of the Brexit transition period. Those with a work permit get to keep all their existing rights for residence and employment. Generally they do not need to take actionExternal link. But since January 1, UK citizens no longer have an automatic right to live or work in the EU and Switzerland. For those British nationals wanting to work in Switzerland in the future, they must now meet the terms of the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act (FNIA). One of the biggest changes is that newcomers are now subject to an annual quota system (2,100 long-term B residence permits and 1,400 short-term L permits for 2021). New arrivals will also face stiffer competition for jobs. They are now second in line to Swiss and EU/EFTA nationals for any jobs advertised in Switzerland and the range of work is limited to highly qualified “essential manager and specialist” positions. Job seekers can also no longer simply travel to Switzerland to find work and must first obtain a work permit before entering the country. What is the impact of Brexit for people living and working in Switzerland? Rosie Robson, a Zurich-based IT recruiter, is witnessing the impact of these changes first-hand: “All of a sudden it's tricky for us to recruit Brits who are not yet resident here. Very sad.” Tim Masson, who lives in Basel, said he “felt bad” for UK nationals who might be interested in working for big pharma firms like Roche and Novartis in Switzerland. “It would have been an extremely easy move up until January this year, but now not so much. I’m just glad I had the chance to enjoy freedom of movement throughout my 20s and end up in beautiful Switzerland,” he wrote on Facebook. British officials acknowledge the new challenges for British nationals seeking work in Switzerland in the future. But they say the quota total is a realistic figure that reflects previous annual averages. One unexpected upshot of Brexit is a push for some UK nationals to apply for Swiss nationality, according to Nick Steven. “As my spouse is an EU27 citizen we will no longer be able to move to the UK so easily with the new “hostile environment”. At least with Swiss citizenship I would be able to move to my spouse’s country if circumstances dictated it. Plus we know my family and I have at least one place where we know we can reside in the same place. Certainly the doors of the UK are now closed to us,” he wrote on Facebook. The British embassy in Bern dismisses this notion. It argues that the UK's new global immigration systemExternal link treats people from all parts of the world equally, include those seeking to join family members in the UK. In the year to September 2020, the UK issued 147,448 visas for family reasons. I’m a UK citizen and I want to come and study at a Swiss university. What has changed? For any UK students who were already studying in Switzerland before December 31, 2020, it is business as usual. But from January 1, new students from the UK wishing to study in Switzerland are subject to the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act (FNIA). They face stricter entry conditionsExternal link but they will not need a visa to enter Switzerland to studyExternal link – like other third country students – and tuition fees, which are decided by each individual university, have not changedExternal link (ranging from CHF500-2,000 per semester, plus small additional fees).
2021-02-02;No holes in Swiss cheese exports despite coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/no-holes-in-swiss-cheese-exports-despite-coronavirus/46338236;Swiss cheese continues to sell well abroad with exports increasing by 1.6% in 2020.   The pandemic has not made a dent in the global appetite for cheese from the Alpine nation.  A total of 77,124 tonnes was exported last year with a value of CHF693.8 million ($772.5 million), an increase of 3.9% in revenues.  Accounting for more than 80% of the export volume (62,919 tonnes), Europe is the most important market, Switzerland Cheese Marketing said on Tuesday. Germany alone imported 32,926 tonnes followed by Italy with 10,533 tonnes and France with 5,839 tonnes.  Another bit of good news was a recovery in exports outside Europe after a drop in 2019. A total of 14,205 tonnes of Swiss cheese were exported to the rest of the world in 2020.  Swiss consumers also looked beyond the country’s borders to satisfy their craving for fancy fromage. Switzerland imported 71,664 tonnes of cheese last year (up by 11.7%) at a cost of CHF453.5 million. Almost 82% of imported products came from Italy (up 12.2%), Germany (up 13.8%) and France (up 6.9%).  Switzerland also saved some cash through higher profits on exports and decreased cost of imports. The average export price per kilo of Swiss cheese, at CHF 9.19/kg (wholesale price), is higher than in the previous year (CHF 8.97/kg). Conversely, the average import price fell from CHF 6.78/kg in 2019 to CHF 6.31 /kg (wholesale price).  Around 45% of Swiss milk is processed into more than 700 Swiss cheeses and around 40% is exported to more than 70 countries around the world. 
2021-02-02;Secure asylum centre re-opens to cope with rising unruly behaviour;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/secure-asylum-centre-re-opens-to-cope-with-rising-unruly-behaviour/46337976;Switzerland is re-opening a mothballed facility to house disruptive asylum seekers. The high security Les Verrières centre in the western canton of Neuchâtel was first opened in December 2019 but was shut down six months later to save costs as the numbers of asylum seekers was dropping. The centre, with space for 20 people, will be reopened in mid-February, says the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). “There are currently asylum seekers in all asylum regions who disrupt the proper operation and coexistence in federal asylum centers and, through their behavior, also impair public safety and order,” read a statement released on Tuesday. “In cooperation with the local and cantonal authorities and its partner organisations, SEM has taken a number of immediate measures to prevent this intolerable behavior.” One such measure is to re-open Les Verrières to relieve the strain on other asylum centres. It will soon be able to accommodate trouble making male adult asylum seekers. A recently published report from the Swiss government advisory group, the National Commission for the Prevention of Torture (NCPT), cited conflict as being part of everyday life in eight federal asylum centres – and that it sometimes escalated into violence. SEM said it would draw up fresh guidelines by the spring of this year. Even though numbers of asylum seeker applications has dropped during the pandemic, asylum centres have complained of being crowded as they have been forced to introduce social distancing measures to prevent outbreaks of the coronavirus.
2021-02-01;SWISS cuts Geneva flights to ‘absolute minimum’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-cuts-geneva-flights-to--absolute-minimum-/46335876;Swiss International Air Lines is scaling back its Geneva flight operations to an absolute minimum until the end of February, citing coronavirus travel restrictions. Cuts are also being made at Zurich Airport. “Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) is temporarily reducing its already-downsized flight operations in Geneva to an absolute minimum until the end of February with effect from today (Monday 1 February), in view of the tighter travel restrictions announced by the Swiss government,” it said in a statementExternal link on Monday. Further changes are also being made to SWISS’s Zurich flight schedules. Many of the short- and long-haul SWISS services from and to Zurich will continue to be operated, the Lufthansa subsidiary said. But the already heavily reduced range of flights is being further reduced with effect from February 1. “As a result, SWISS will only be operating around 10% of the February services which it provided in 2019,” it said.  SWISS will continue to operate 13 weekly services between Geneva and its Zurich hub, as well as seven weekly connections between Geneva and the Frankfurt hub of Lufthansa. The airline said it remained committed to Geneva Airport in the long term and would expand its present range services when possible. SWISS CEO Dieter Vranckx said: “As soon as conditions permit and the demand for air travel returns, SWISS will steadily expand our services from Geneva again, as we will from Zurich, too.” Any travellers affected by SWISS flight cancelations can rebook free of charge or have the price of their ticket refunded. 
2021-02-01;Study: airing ski gondola cabins cuts Covid-19 transmission risks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/study--airing-ski-gondola-cabins-cuts-covid-19-transmission-risks/46335660;The risk of catching coronavirus on a 12-minute gondola ride is 100 times less than during a normal working day in a small two-person office, according to a Swiss study. Scientists at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) carried out researchExternal link at the Engelberg-Trübsee-Titlis ski resort in central Switzerland into the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2 droplets on different ski lifts. They found that closed windows, long journeys and large numbers of people increased the risks of catching the virus in different sizes of cable cars and gondolas. However, the risk of catching the virus on a 12-minute ride on a gondola with open windows is a thousand times less than during a dinner with eight people in a room with closed windows, the EMPA study found. The scientists used air pressure sensors to measure airflows in three different kinds of enclosed ski lifts: a small 5m3 gondola that can carry eight people, a medium-sized lift of 40m3, and a larger one of 50m3 for 80 passengers. The tests found that, with cabin windows open, air was exchanged 138 times per hour in the smallest cabin, 180 times in the medium one and 42 times in the largest. Its poor ventilation was due to the fact that it had only small skylights on the roof and no windows open to the sides. These results are much better when compared with a railway carriage, for example, where the air is renewed on average 7-14 times per hour. In an office this happens only twice per hour. When comparing the three different ski lifts, the risk of catching the virus from other contaminated passengers is more or less similar, the study found. This is due to the fact that the journeys with the large cable cars are generally shorter than those by gondola. With the windows closed, however, the risk increases considerably. Swiss ski resorts have remained open this winter, unlike those in neighbouring countries. The federal government announced in early December that ski areas were being allowed to open but that resorts would need permits from cantonal governments. “The prerequisite is that the epidemiological situation so allows, and that hospitals, contact tracing services and testing sites have sufficient capacity,” it said. The federal government has not fixed any limits on the number of visitors allowed into resorts. But all enclosed ski transport, like gondolas and trains, are limited to two-thirds capacity, and cantons have a duty to monitor compliance. In recent weeks, the police have enforced limits on the number of visitors to some resorts and popular mountain areas.
2021-02-01;Covid-19 pandemic leads to 23% drop in asylum requests;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-23--drop-in-asylum-requests/46334264;The number of asylum requests in Switzerland fell by almost a quarter (23%) to 11,041 people last year, annual statistics reported on Monday have revealed. The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) said the decline was due to the coronavirus pandemic and resulting travel restrictions. Most of the asylum requests recorded last year were from Eritrean citizens (1,917), followed by people from Afghanistan, Algeria and Syria, according to a statementExternal link released on Monday. The list of the countries of origin is similar to Swiss statistics from previous years. The increase in the number of Eritrean nationals is largely the result of births and family reunions, the SEM said. In 2020, the Swiss asylum authorities processed more than 17,220 requests (some cases referred to applications filed in previous years). This reduced the overall backlog to 3,852 cases – the lowest level since 1994, the SEM said. In total, 5,409 people – or a third of all requests - were granted asylum status in Switzerland in 2020. The number of rejected asylum seekers who left Switzerland voluntarily dropped to 1,051 last year, down by more than 600 compared with the previous year. Another 745 people were deported, mainly to one of the other 31 member states which signed the Dublin agreement or to their country of origin. For 2021, the SEM expects around 15,000 asylum applications.
2021-02-01;Switzerland calls for end to Myanmar coup;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-calls-for-end-to-myanmar-coup/46334332;The Swiss foreign ministry has urged Myanmar’s military, which seized power on Monday in a coup, to “immediately suspend its actions”. It also called for the release of all government officials and civil society leaders. “The Swiss foreign ministry supports the aspirations of the Myanmar people for democracy, peace and development, and calls on the army to immediately suspend its actions,” the ministry told the Swiss news agency, Keystone-SDA, on Monday. In a tweet, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis also expressed his grave concern about the situation in Myanmar. Myanmar's military seized power in a coup against the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was reportedly detained along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party in early morning raids. The army said it had carried out the detentions and imposed a one-year state of emergency in response to election fraud , according to a statement on a military-owned television station. Myanmar's ruling junta on Monday announced a purge of Suu Kyi's government, removing 24 ministers and deputies and naming 11 replacements in its new administration after seizing power The announcement on Myawaddy TV cited an article of the country's constitution, which allows the military to take over in times of emergency. The announcer said the coronavirus crisis and the government's failure to postpone November elections were reasons for the emergency. In elections, Suu Kyi’s party won 396 out of 476 seats in the combined lower and upper houses of parliament. The state Union Election Commission has confirmed that result. But the military has claimed there were millions of irregularities in voter lists in 314 townships that could have let voters cast multiple ballots or commit other “voting malpractice.” The United Nations led condemnation of Myanmar's military. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the developments were a “serious blow to democratic reforms”. The United States, Britain, Australia and the European Union condemned the military's coup and detentions and its declaration of a state of emergency. Myanmar's neighbour China was more muted, however. “We have noted what has happened in Myanmar and are in the process of further understanding the situation,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily news briefing in Beijing. “China is a friendly neighbour of Myanmar's. We hope that all sides in Myanmar can appropriately handle their differences under the constitution and legal framework and safeguard political and social stability,” he added.
2021-01-31;Vaccine delays cost Switzerland up to CHF100 million per day;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/vaccine-delays-cost-switzerland-up-to-100-million-francs-per-day/46332626;Delivery delays from vaccine manufacturers mean half as many people in Switzerland will be vaccinated as planned in February. However, Interior Minister Alain Berset remains confident that the goal of vaccinating everyone who wants to by the summer can still be reached. According to the German-language paper NZZamSonntagExternal link, only around 650,000 vaccinations will be possible in February compared to the original goal of 1.3 million. The federal government quietly changed its vaccination target last week after both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna announced delivery delays. On January 21, Interior Minister Alain Berset announced that it should be possible to administer 525 doses for every 100,000 people every day – seven days a week. Last week, a confidential letter sent from the federal health office to the cantons scaled this back to 380 vaccinations for every 100,000 per day and only on weekdays. The slower than expected roll-out not only has health consequences but also a massive impact on the economy. “If the economic situation is normalised one day earlier through vaccinations, Switzerland will save up to CHF110 million ($114 million), states the Swiss National Covid-19 Taskforce in a new study. In an interview with the same paper, Berset said that although fewer people than planned will be vaccinated in February, he believes that it will still be possible to vaccinate everyone who wants to by the summer. “We now have the problem that we are receiving some deliveries later than planned. This is annoying, but we have to live with it and constantly adapt,” he told the paper. He added that the country will make up for the deficit. “For the campaign to be successful, it is not decisive whether we have vaccinated the first 10% of the population at the end of January or the end of February. It is important that we are quick in the second quarter when the large quantities of vaccine arrive.” Based on the letter sent to the cantons on January 27, it will be difficult to reach the 650,000 vaccination target. Some 200,000 vaccine doses are expected to be delivered in February. When combined with the current reserves in the cantons, the total vaccinations only amount to 450,000 doses, according to the paper. Berset noted other vaccines will eventually be added including that from AstraZeneca, of which Switzerland has ordered 5.3 million doses of the total 15.8 million doses ordered from three manufacturers. A spokesperson for the Swiss subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson told the SonntagsZeitungExternal link that the company is in talks with the Swiss federal health office about its vaccine candidate. To date, around 260,000 people in Switzerland have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. On Saturday, Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told CH-Media in an interview that she has been vaccinated. The share of people who want to be vaccinated appears to be on the rise, according to a survey by the University of Zurich. In the third week of January some 55% of people said they would most likely or likely get vaccinated compared to only 41% in mid-December.
2021-01-30;UN envoy on stalled Syria talks in Geneva: ‘we can’t continue like this’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/un-envoy-on-stalled-syria-talks-in-geneva---we-can-t-continue-like-this-/46331318;The fifth round of talks at the United Nations in Geneva to draft a new Syrian constitution and pave the way to peace in the war-torn country have ended without progress. UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen expressed frustration over the lack of progress achieved at the latest round of talks of the so-called Constitutional Committee for Syria. “This week has been a disappointment,” Pedersen told reporters on Friday. “I set out a few things I thought we should be able to achieve before we started this meeting and I’m afraid we did not manage to achieve these things.” Pedersen explained that Syrian government representatives had rejected separate proposals on working methods from both the opposition and the UN envoy. The United States and a few other countries have accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of deliberately stalling and delaying the drafting of a new constitution until after presidential elections are held this year. The UN envoy said that a mechanism was needed to allow the parties to identify points of agreement and disagreement in order to revise the Constitution. “I told the 45 members of the drafting bodies we can’t continue like this, Pedersen told reporters in Geneva after five days of meetings. There is no set date for another round of talks. Pedersen indicated that he will brief the UN Security Council on February 9. The talks aim to make progress in drafting a new Syrian charter to pave the way for UN-sponsored elections. The core group of the constitutional committee is composed of 45 people - representing equally the Damascus government, the opposition and civil society. In August, the Syrian Constitutional Committee met in Geneva for the third round of talks after a three-day pause due to positive cases of coronavirus among four participants. All members were required to quarantine in their hotel and continue working online. After the fourth round of talks in December, the committee had agreed on the agenda for the next round of discussions - constitutional principles - giving rise to tentative hope.
2021-01-30;‘We are all the same when we get round a fondue’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-we-are-all-the-same-when-we-get-round-a-fondue-/46315886;Swiss-Turkish comedian Semih Yavsaner talks to SWI swissinfo.ch about his best-known satirical character Müslüm, “ethnic humour” and its limits. Yavsaner is a Bern-based artist whose cabaret act includes elements of stand-up, song, dance and improvisation. He is not the only Swiss comedian who uses immigration as an inspiration for his television and stage material. Many similar acts can be found on the Swiss comedy circuit - and especially on social media - including Charles Nguela, a Swiss-Congolese stand-up comedian, Johnny Burn, a comedian with Cambodian roots, and Bendrit Bajra, a young performer with a Kosovo-Albanian background. SWI swissinfo.ch: You like to play with stereotypes. Your stage character Müslüm, with his thick monobrow and huge moustache, is supposed to be a typical Turk. Aren’t you worried that this kind of approach may just be making life more difficult for Muslim foreigners in Switzerland? Semih Yavsaner: Müslüm’s look is not supposed to be stereotypical at all. I don't know any Turks who walk around in pink suits. By slipping into this costume, I can free myself from these kinds of stereotypes. My character goes to places that have nothing to with kebabs, bouncers or fast cars. I try to put him in places that create a certain tension, which instil fear in him and where he doesn't really belong, such as the University of Zurich auditorium where Winston Churchill gave his speech about Europe in 1954External link. The foreigner then thinks that all this is possible. SWI swissinfo.ch: Immigration is a controversial issue in Switzerland that rarely makes people laugh. Does Müslüm make migrants laugh? S.Y.:  That's exactly the big misunderstanding. I think Müslüm manages to reach lots of people because he doesn't just want to make them laugh. The audience should be active participants in society. My intention is not to have them laugh at someone being different – they should also experience the darker sides, which also live in me. SWI swissinfo.ch: When the Bern football club Young Boys became champions, you made an appearance and you - or rather Müslüm - were insulted and bottles were thrown at you. How did you deal with that situation? S.Y.:  That was probably the most unpleasant thing he - and I - have ever had to experience. I tried to protect the band and myself. I had to be on stage and dodge the bottles. That wasn’t nice at all. SWI swissinfo.ch: Why were you attacked? S.Y.:  From Müslüm's perspective, I wanted to look at why most Swiss national football players sing the national anthem discreetly or not at all. My idea was to start the national anthem with “Trittst im Morgenrot daher [When the morning skies glow red] and then stop abruptly after the opening sentence and ask the audience the question: Honestly, which of these 11 migrants voluntarily steps out in the morning light? That's the biggest cliché ever! That would have been the punchline. But after the national anthem began, most fans thought we were going to sing the whole anthem together, instead of just the beginning. I can abstract away from whole thing, though, and say that it was done to Müslüm. He's kind of a shield for me. As Semih, I probably wouldn't have survived it. This is how I reassure myself. Due to a misunderstanding, Müslüm experienced something like racism that day and he was very affected by it. But I have to say that it was an isolated incident. SWI swissinfo.ch: In Switzerland you are sometimes viewed as someone who is politically motivated or socially committed. You say yourself in a song that you are “socially aware like Nelson Mandela”. Are you a political artist? S.Y.:  It’s impossible to answer that kind of question. Where does politics begin? I believe it starts in everyday life with what we wear, what we eat or what we do. Actually, everything that characterises us is, in some way, political. But I'm not interested in conventional politics, where everything is always about interests. A system where lobbying is tolerated is very revealing. I also don't want to speak on behalf of a political party because this means constant censorship. How am I supposed to develop as a performer in this political context? It’s impossible. That's why I'm not interested in politics. I feel like that I was able to trigger a lot with my character. SWI swissinfo.ch: Where do you see this influence in particular? S.Y.:  For example, when a sick child in hospital listens to my song “Süpervitamin”, or when a carer writes to me that his patient was listening to my song “La Bambele” just before she passed away. There are really many examples. SWI swissinfo.ch: There are often discussions about the limits of humour when it comes to minorities, ethnic or religious groups. What are your feelings on this? Do you set limits for yourself? S.Y.:  As Müslüm, I have never really paid any attention to these pseudo-taboos. I avoid these topics, because they simply don’t interest me. It is then too obvious, I mean the aspects, reading between the lines. It's just like coronavirus these days. Everybody talks about corona. And then you go on stage and tell some jokes about it. First punchline, terrorist attacks, second punchline, coronavirus... It's not my thing. I'm not interested in that. I see myself much more as a cabaret artist. Art cannot be categorised and put into boxes. SWI swissinfo.ch: How tolerant is your Swiss audience towards your humour? S.Y.:  Incredibly tolerant, I think. That's probably the greatest luxury for any artist. I can question everything. I have unlimited freedom of speech and huge possibilities in terms of life and free thinking. That makes me feel good. And the Swiss audience allows me to do good things on stage, too, by giving me that space, to “be”, without any limits, and by being willing to temporarily discard their preconceived ideas. SWI swissinfo.ch: In recent years, more and more European comedians of foreign origin (North Africans, Indians, Albanians, Turks, Somalis...) have been making their mark. How do you explain this phenomenon? S.Y.:  I think people also want “other people” to exist not only as refugees, asylum seekers, or guest workers but also as artists. SWI swissinfo.ch: What do you think of the term “ethnic comedy”? S.Y.:  It’s a turn-off, just like the word “integration”. These terms are always loaded with obvious meaning. I try not to get bogged down by the word integration”. My character shouldn’t always be associated with words like foreign”, migrant background , and integration”. These words are loaded with a certain negativity. Art should be packaged in such a way that it creates the desire “to be”. These [loaded] words don't really permit the creation of anything new , they stand in the way of any kind of cathartic effect.
2021-01-29;Proposed burka ban has solid support, poll finds;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/proposed-burka-ban-has-solid-support--poll-finds/46321606;Supporters of a proposed face-cover ban in Switzerland have a clear lead over opponents ahead of a nationwide ballot to be held in March, according to a new opinion poll, published on Friday. Attempts to challenge a government-licensed digital identification scheme (eID) and a controversial free trade accord with Indonesia – two other issues that come before Swiss voters in seven weeks – appear to fail. The poll was commissioned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), swissinfo.ch’s parent company, and carried out by the GfS Bern research institute. For detailed figures see chart below. Martina Mousson, political scientist and project leader at the leading research institute, says she is not surprised by the poll result. “People's initiatives usually start off well but as a rule they lose ground as the campaigns gather speed and opponents present their counter-arguments,” she said. She does not explain why respondents among the expat Swiss community appear to be more strongly in favour of a ban. The main argument by the proponents of the ban appear to be security concerns and to a lesser extent Islamophobic sentiments she analyses. The initiative was launched five years ago and is generally considered as an attack by members of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party against followers of the Islamic religion, which requires women to wear the burka and niqab. Mousson notes a clear polarisation between supporters from the political left and the political right. She said respondents in the French- and Italian-speaking cantons are backing the initiative more than those in the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland. Asked about a possible impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the wearing of masks in public for hygiene, Mousson remains sceptical. She said it could work either way and the situation was further complicated by the fact that women’s rights is used as an argument both by the political right as well as by feminists mainly from the political left. The ballot on the proposed burka ban comes nearly 12 years after Swiss voters approved a ban on the construction of new minarets, in what was seen as a political upset. Mousson says a direct comparison between the two initiatives is difficult. “Possible anti-Islamic sentiment doesn’t seem to be a taboo topic today as much as in 2009. There are face-cover bans in place at a local level in Switzerland and in neighbouring countries,” she said. But the issue certainly has potential for a lively campaign, Mousson added. A free trade accord with Indonesia, including controversial quotas for the import of palm oil to Switzerland, enjoys solid backing according to pollsters But a considerable number of respondents, 13%, has yet to make up their minds about the issue. The poll revealed a split between respondents from the right and the centre versus the left as well as those without clear links to a party. Supporters seem to have the stronger, mainly economic arguments, but Mousson points out that environmental issues have proven popular in previous votes and elections over the past two years. “It will be interesting to see if opponents manage the turn things round,” she said. Attempts to veto newly-adopted laws at the ballot box usually flop. Switzerland’s history of direct democracy shows the government has a clear advantage. The same rule also applies, in theory, to the vote about a legal basis for an electronic authentication scheme which is meant to simplify the use of online services, both for commercial purposes as for e-government offers. But 11% of respondents in the survey are still undecided, possibly struggling to understand the issue. Supporters of the eID law currently have a slim majority with a margin of just 5%. Political scientist the research institute’s co-director, Lukas Golder, says the issue is a “matter of trust” in the authorities. The survey found that younger citizens are more concerned about data protection and he doesn’t rule out a defeat for parliament and the government. “It is possible that both the grassroots from the left and the right alongside voters with no close links to a political party could sway the result,” Golder said.
2021-01-28;Transparency International: in fight against corruption, Switzerland can do better;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/transparency-international--in-fight-against-corruption--switzerland-can-do-better/46325164;"Switzerland is perceived as having some of the lowest levels of corruption in the public sector according to Transparency International’s latest Corruption Perceptions Index. However, the NGO says the country still has work to do, specifically on political lobbying and money laundering. The Alpine nation is accustomed to being one of the top performers in the annual ranking measuring perceived levels of public sector corruption in around 180 countries, and the 2020 ranking is no exception. After dropping a spot in 2019, Switzerland is back in third place (the third time in four years), tying with Finland, Singapore and Sweden with a score of 85 out of 100. New Zealand and Denmark both scored 889 points to take top spot. Somalia and South Sudan fared worst with scores of 12 to put them at 179th place, behind Syria with a score of 14. First published in 1995, the index is calculated using 13 different data sources that provide perceptions of public sector corruption from businesspeople and country experts. “Switzerland regularly scores well, and that’s good news,” said Martin Hilti, director of the Swiss chapter of Transparency International. However, he was quick to point out that the country is also 15 points away from the best score. Hilti pointed out that corruption remains a problem in Switzerland citing various scandals in recent years, some of which include the rewarding of public contracts. Some common practices in the public sector also create conflicts of interest and thus raise the risk of corruption. “Cronyism is a widespread practice,” he told swissinfo.ch. One issue is that Swiss parliamentarians are allowed to have various paid mandates outside of their political activities, which he believes creates conflicts. The director of Transparency Switzerland also noted recent controversies where ministers and high-ranking civil servants accept positions in the private sector as soon as their political mandates are over. Hilti also argued that Switzerland’s good performance in the index is “dangerous, because it only shows part of the truth”. The biggest challenges are in the private sector, which is not included in the index, he said. This can concern money laundering in the financial sector or the involvement in financing corruption abroad. The NGO finds that Switzerland still doesn’t have effective mechanisms to detect corruption cases and to prevent and stamp out money laundering. Switzerland’s legal basis for combating money laundering contains significant gaps in relation to minimum international standards, and its scope of application should be extended, Hilti argued. Switzerland could also do much better in terms of whistleblower protection, he added. Another blind spot concerns major international sports organizations, such as FIFA, which are almost all headquartered in Switzerland and present a greater risk of corruption because of the huge amounts of money they handle. “Because they are based in Switzerland, the responsibility for regulating them lies with Switzerland,” Hilti said. The 2020 edition of the Index also looked at the links between corruption and the government response to Covid-19 noting that corruption “undermines health systems and contributes to the decline of democracy”. The report shows that the least corrupt countries invest more in the health system, are better able to provide universal health coverage and are less likely to violate democratic norms and institutions or the rule of law. Transparency International cites the example of Bangladesh (26 points in Index) where there is pervasive corruption in the provision of medical supplies; or the Philippines (34 points), where the fight against coronavirus was accompanied by major attacks on human rights and press freedom. Even in New Zealand, which took the top spot and has been lauded for its pandemic response, there was room for improvement, the NGO noted. “While the government communicates openly about the measures and policies it puts in place, more transparency is needed around public procurement for Covid-19 recovery,” the organization wrote. “The Covid-19 pandemic has allowed the centralisation of more power in the hands of governments, thus increasing the risk of abuse,” explained Hilti. And even if such abuses have not been observed in Switzerland, he said that the pandemic had highlighted problems, especially “the weight of lobbying”. “We have seen that organizations which had good access to the government or the federal administrations had more opportunities to make their voices heard during the crisis,” he told swissinfo.ch."
2021-01-28;Neutrality faces ‘huge challenges’, warns ex-Swiss foreign minister;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/neutrality-faces--huge-challenges---warns-ex-swiss-foreign-minister/46319590;"Neutrality remains one of the key principles of Swiss foreign policy. Is the idea still relevant in the face of modern conflicts, terrorism and cyberattacks? Former foreign affairs minister Micheline Calmy-Rey tells SWI swissinfo.ch why she thinks neutrality remains Switzerland’s ‘trump card’. The meaning of Swiss neutrality and how it has evolved over the years continues to be the topic of numerous discussions and studies in Switzerland. In her new book, Die Neutralität: Zwischen Mythos und Vorbild [Neutrality: from myth to model],External link former Swiss foreign affairs minister Micheline Calmy-Rey, who coined the phrase “active foreign policy”, talks about the history, theory and practice of Swiss neutrality and how it should continue to evolve. swissinfo.ch: Switzerland has applied for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2023-24. Why do you believe such a candidacy is compatible with neutrality? Micheline Calmy-Rey: In most cases, the Security Council acts politically rather than militarily. The Security Council has only taken military decisions on four occasions: for Korea, Iraq, Kosovo in 1999 and Libya in 2011. Each time the decision was taken unanimously, which means the council acted on behalf of the international community. This is very different from a classic conflict between two countries where neutrality applies. In the cases mentioned above, neutrality does not apply as the interventions were done on behalf of the international community. But if Switzerland becomes a non-permanent member of the Security Council, won’t it have to take positions on certain issues and risk being exposed to external pressures? M. C.-R.: Switzerland is already active in the UN. It takes positions and voices its concerns – it does not sit silent. A seat on the Security Council would give Switzerland more clout and more opportunities to act. So, it’s also about vested interests, such as giving our small country the chance to play a role on the international stage? M. C.-R.: Yes, and thanks to the intensive international contacts that come with being on the Security Council, Switzerland could extend its network which is essential for the effectiveness of Swiss foreign policy. It would give Switzerland access to the superpowers and help it defend its interests. Sweden also had this same discussion about whether a seat on the Security Council would be compatible with state neutrality; it eventually chose the role of mediator. It’s not easy to reach agreement within the Security Council. Switzerland would also be a good mediator as we are used to reaching consensual solutions and we have good diplomats. This role is made for us. In your new book Swiss human rights activist Jean Ziegler accuses Switzerland of being hypocritical. What does Switzerland need to do to avoid such charges in the future? M. C.-R.: The question is about whether neutrality is compatible with Switzerland having close political and economic ties to countries that systematically violate human rights or are involved in conflicts. Take Saudi Arabia, for example. In spring 2019, Switzerland refused to join 36 countries that were calling for the release of imprisoned human rights activists and an investigation into the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Switzerland decided not to add its signature to the statement. You have to ask yourself whether we have forgotten our humanitarian tradition. Is it really in Switzerland’s interest to abstain in such a case considering it wants to strengthen its influence? It’s about our credibility and persuasive power. I don’t think economic interests and neutrality should be played off against each other. We should act coherently on the international stage. From a legal perspective, Switzerland does not have to adopt a policy of neutrality. Why does Switzerland do so, and why is it so strict with itself? M. C.-R.: Swiss neutrality has gradually developed; it is not what it used to be in the 16th century. It was born out of necessity and a need for security. It has now turned into “active neutrality” based on international law. Neutrality has evolved to address global risks and challenges, like the coronavirus pandemic or sustainable development. Preventive measures and solving global problems form a large part of protecting Switzerland’s security and interests in the world. But you are right, the rules of Swiss neutrality law only apply to conflicts between two countries. It is not legally regulated, but results from the neutral state’s willingness to remain neutral in the event of a conflict between two states. The specific political elements that make up neutrality policy are not set in stone; they should take into account foreign policy and security interests. While Sweden and Austria have turned their backs on neutrality, Switzerland holds on to the idea. Is our nation naïve to believe that neutrality could protect us? M. C.-R.: I am an advocate for the policy of active neutrality, not for Switzerland to give up its neutrality. A policy of neutrality means that Switzerland is on the side of international law and does not support any party to a conflict. It sides with the law. Of course, it is appropriate to speak up and condemn violations of international law. Remaining silent is not enough. Should Switzerland go one step further and seek US protection via NATO in today’s uncertain times? M. C.-R.: This is exactly what I say in my book. Swiss neutrality faces huge challenges. The UN and its collective security system is being weakened while new forms of conflict are emerging. Another challenge is the Swiss army’s defence capability. The purpose of armed neutrality is to be able to defend our territory. Swiss arms exports call into question our credibility when it comes to applying neutrality. Swiss neutrality faces several different challenges, but this does not mean it is no longer useful. Neutrality remains our trump card. It gives Switzerland a special place on the international stage thanks to its humanitarian engagement, its good offices [tradition] and its policy of “soft power”- diplomacy and peace promotion. In your book you even raise the question of whether the EU could ever be neutral. But if the EU became neutral, NATO would have to be dissolved. How realistic is that? M. C.-R.: The Swiss model for neutrality cannot just be transferred to another country or an institution like the EU. That is not what I am calling for. Maybe I did not express myself correctly. Maybe I shouldn’t have used the term “neutrality” in connection with the EU. However, the basics and principles of neutrality can be inspiring. At the heart of neutrality is the willingness to pursue a non-violent policy based on law. It is about renouncing the use of aggressive force. This idea is not incompatible with European defence policy or with a transnational approach to defence. What I’m calling for is a collective EU security system. If the EU developed in that direction, could Switzerland take part? If Switzerland joined the EU, it would not be a legal obligation for it to give up its neutrality, but rather a tricky political issue. We must not forget that the goal of the EU’s common foreign and security policy is a common defence policy. If the EU managed to implement such a policy, it would hardly be compatible with Swiss neutrality."
2021-01-27;Switzerland changes policy on Covid testing and quarantine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-changes-policy-on-covid-testing-and-quarantine/46322138;The Swiss government has decided to adapt its Covid testing and quarantine policy and has earmarked extra funds to soften the impact of restrictions imposed on companies. People coming from high-risk countries will have to present a negative coronavirus test before entering Switzerland, said Interior Minister Alain Berset at a news conference on Wednesday. However, the new rules, which are due to come into force on February 8, do not apply to cross-border workers. In addition, the ten-day quarantine can be shortened if people test negative for Covid-19 after seven days. The government also agreed to pay the costs of testing for people without symptoms. “It is meant as an incentive to increase the number of tests,” said Berset. The measures are to be used in nursing homes, schools, hotels and large companies. The government also plans to spend an additional CHF8 billion ($9 billion) on emergency funds, unemployment benefits and the short-time work compensation programmes. It is also considering re-activating the scheme for state-guaranteed loans to cash-strapped companies hit by the restrictions, including temporary closures. The financial aid still has to be approved by parliament during its spring session in March. Finance Minister Ueli Maurer warned that Switzerland spent CHF15 billion on pandemic-related aid packages last year and it had already pledged another CHF15 billion this year. He dismissed criticism that the government was not generous enough in comparison with other countries, saying it was running up debts of CHF150 million every day. Faced with criticism of the government’s anti-Covid strategy 12 months after the pandemic hit Switzerland, both Economics Minister Guy Parmelin and Interior Minister Berset insisted that Switzerland must not be compared with countries such as Taiwan or New Zealand with low infection rates. “Switzerland is not an island. It is in the centre of the European continent,” Berset said. Parmelin, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, defended the government policy despite errors and the slow pace. “Not everything is perfect, but we're working on it, he said.
2021-01-26;Funding for start-ups barely dented by coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/funding-for-start-ups-barely-dented-by-coronavirus/46318942;More than CHF2 billion of venture capital flowed into young Swiss companies for the second year in a row, a sustained rate of funding that defied the economic destruction wreaked by the pandemic last year. Investors poured more money into fledging cleantech and biotech projects in 2020 at the expense of ICT and particularly fintech companies. These are the findings of the annual Swiss Venture Capital reportExternal link released on Tuesday by startupticker.ch and the investor association SECA. Despite a wobble last March, and to a lesser extent in October, funding for the year fell by just 7% to CHF2.1 billion ($2.37 billion) in 2020. This followed a record smashing 85.5% increase in venture capital (CHF2.3 billion) in 2019, a rate of start-up financing that largely held firm last year despite many investors pulling back on risk in the face of Covid-19. In the first six months of 2020, investments fell by a third in value but rallied strongly in the second half of the year. Investors spread their financing more thinly last year, avoiding the type of mega-deals worth more than CHF200 million that were a feature of 2019.   Biotech start-up projects continued their rally over the last few years to overtake the amount of venture capital invested into ICT companies. As a result, Basel City, home to many pharmaceutical and biotech firms, moved up to second spot in the rank of cantons that attracted such funding. The report plays down the significance of the pandemic for this trend, arguing that very few Covid-19 solutions were offered by start-ups last year. In 2020, a record 46,842 new companies set up shop in Switzerland, an increase of more than 5% on 2019, according to the Institute for Young Enterprises. 
2021-01-25;Rights group calls for halt to Ethiopian repatriation flights;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/rights-group-calls-for-halt-to-ethiopian-repatriation-flights/46316550;Amnesty International has urged the Swiss government to reconsider possible repatriation flights of Ethiopian asylum seekers. The human rights group said it was concerned about reports of a planned deportation operation next Wednesday of several Ethiopians whose asylum request was rejected by Switzerland. Amnesty said the east African country was not safe due to ongoing political tensions, including serious human rights violations in the northern Tigray region ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for June. The Swiss justice ministry’s State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) did not comment on the reports by the Migrant Solidarity Network group. The SEM said last week that repatriation flights to Ethiopia were possible regardless of the coronavirus pandemic. But such operations to conflict areas were excluded, a spokesman told the Swiss news agency, Keystone-SDA. In November, the Swiss government pledged CHF2 million ($2.3 million) for humanitarian aid in the violence-hit Tigray region. It has called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law.
2021-01-25;No match for most new Covid strains in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/no-match-for-most-new-covid-strains-in-switzerland/46316154;Nearly 1,000 cases of infections with a new strain of coronavirus have been found in Switzerland so far. The British variant accounts for just over 470 cases and only 16 cases of infections with the South African strain have been identified to date according to Federal Office of Public Health. No cases of infections with the Brazilian strain have been found, health officials told the Swiss news agency, Keystone-SDA. However, nearly 490 infections with mutated strains do not match with any of the three variants. There are concerns that new strains are more transmissible and could cause a surge in infections and that the vaccination campaign in Switzerland could be further delayed. The health authorities say they expect Pfizer/BioNTech to send new supplies to Switzerland in the next few days. Shipments had to be reduced because of changes to its manufacturing processes. Vaccination programmes in nursing homes had to be cut postponed as a result, but experts said Pfizer/BioNTech would boost production by the end of April. Meanwhile, the health office has adapted its vaccination policy for pregnant women who suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure or are overweight. The office now asks these patients to get the jab. Pregnant women are not more likely to be infected with Covid-19, according to the Swiss association of gynaecologists. But they are more vulnerable to a heavy coronavirus infection.
2021-01-24;Party leaders call for tougher Covid measures at Swiss borders;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/party-leaders-call-for-tougher-covid-measures-at-swiss-borders/46312338;Leaders of the six biggest political parties in the country have sent a joint letter to the federal government, urging it to put in place a strict testing and quarantine regime for all travellers, in a bid to limit the spread of the new coronavirus variants. The measures demanded by leaders of the Swiss People’s Party, the Social Democrats, the Centre Party, the Radical-Liberals, the Greens and the Green-Liberals “break previous taboos”, according to the SonntagsZeitung. They target all people entering Switzerland, including cross-border workers, and would require them to present a negative coronavirus test result at airports and border crossings, in addition to then going into quarantine. Depending on the situation in the country of origin, travellers would need to enter either a standard or “light” quarantine. Exceptions could be made for people from “the very few countries that are officially considered coronavirus-free, such as Taiwan,” leader of the Radical-Liberals, Petra Gössi, told the newspaper. Cross-border workers, meanwhile, would need to be tested regularly, such as every three days. Up until now, only the People’s Party had called for travel restrictions on commuters. Strictly limiting the number of people entering Switzerland “is the only way we can protect the health of the population and the effect of the measures [already] in place,” said Green-Liberals leader, Jürg Grossen, who initiated the joint letter. Currently, only those arriving from a country where the rate of infection is greater than Switzerland’s must go into quarantine. The list of countries affected by this policy is regularly updated by the Federal Office of Public Health. Starting Sunday, anyone entering France will need to present a negative coronavirus test result. This requirement applies only at airports and not at land borders, train stations or ports, a Ministry of Health spokesperson confirmed to the news agency Keystone-SDA on Sunday.  According to the SonntagsZeitung, the European Union (of which Switzerland is not a member) is considering imposing testing and quarantine requirements on those arriving from countries where the virus is widespread, and discouraging non-essential travel in general. Keystone-SDA also confirmed that, in an effort to get the virus under control, the Federal Council has sent a proposal to the cantons for mass testing in schools, care homes and businesses. The rapid tests would be paid for by the state and the approach would be based on the model used by canton Graubunden, which plans to complete 20,000 tests per week starting this Wednesday.
2021-01-23;Childcare workers want priority for Covid-19 vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/childcare-workers-want-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine/46311896;Staff at crèches and after-school care facilities should be among the first to be offered the vaccine, especially since more contagious variants of the coronavirus are circulating, says the Swiss Childcare Association, Kibesuisse. The system of childcare services is considered vital to the economy because it ensures the well-being of children and helps working parents – yet during the pandemic it has been neglected by authorities, the umbrella organisation claimed in a press release on Friday. Kibesuisse said getting childcare workers vaccinated early would help the sector to avoid staff shortages due to quarantine measures or illness. It is demanding, as the teachers’ federation have done for its staff, that childcare personnel be next in line for the vaccine after risk groups and healthcare workers. “We’re talking about the positive development of the youngest in our society and about supporting the Swiss economy,” Michele Kaufmann Meyer of Kibesuisse told Swiss public radio RTS. “A parent who can’t send their child to the crèche can’t go to work.” The association is also asking the authorities to offer financial compensation to parents who choose not to send their children to childcare facilities as a way of relieving the burden on crèches, and parents who may eventually need to find alternatives when these facilities become short-staffed and can no longer welcome their charges. Roughly one-third of children in Switzerland – between 180,000 to 200,000 – attends a crèche, according to estimates by the Conference of Cantonal Directors of Social Affairs.
2021-01-22;Art Basel postponed again due to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/art-basel-postponed-again-due-to-covid-19/46308834;The world’s biggest art fair, Art Basel, has been postponed to the autumn due to the coronavirus. The international art organisation said on Thursday that the Basel show would be moved from June until September this year, “due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and travel restrictions worldwide”. Last year’s edition was cancelled entirely after a similar postponement to the autumn. “While the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination programmes started in many parts of the world last month, 2021 is a year in which planning remains complex due to many uncertainties. By moving our Basel fair to September, we hope to offer our galleries greater possibility for successfully preparing their year,” said Marc Spiegler, Global Director of Art Basel said in a statementExternal link. “Following ten months of vaccination programmes in many countries, we anticipate broad international participation in our Basel show in September, because all our conversations within the artworld indicate a strong desire to see art in person and engage face-to-face with the global cultural scene.” The organisers plan to continue online activities to promote Art Basel galleries to buyers and art fans. Art Basel is traditionally the final stop on the spring/early summer global art buying tour. Unlike other art fairs, where galleries bring comparatively affordable work, the Swiss fair is a showcase for the best dealers have to offer. Galleries will often hold back their most expensive pieces specifically so that they can present them to Art Basel’s nearly 90,000 visitors. In 2019, the last time the fair took place, featured an estimated $4 billion (CHF3.54 billion) worth of art.
2021-01-21;Swiss corporate merger activity dampened by Covid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-corporate-merger-activity-dampened-by-covid/46306694;The coronavirus pandemic left its mark on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in Switzerland last year. The volume of transactions halved, and the number of deals was also down. Overall, the number of transactions with Swiss participation fell from 402 to 363. At $63.1 billion (CHF56 billion), the transaction volume was only half what it was in 2019 – mainly owing to the absence of mega-deals, consultants KPMG said on Thursday. In the second quarter in particular the M&A market suffered a severe slump. Only 74 transactions were completed, the lowest number since the beginning of 2017, while the transaction volume of $7.1 billion was the lowest quarterly figure since the end of 2015. M&A activity for the year as a whole was most intense in the TMT (technology, media and telecommunications) sector. In 2020 more than a fifth of all transactions and more than a third of the transaction volume were attributable to this sector. The two largest deals were also completed in this sector (the purchase of Sunrise by Liberty Global and the merger of CPA Global with Clarivate Analytics). Swiss companies also acquired significantly more foreign companies last year than the other way around. In 154 cases (42% of transactions) foreign companies were acquired by Swiss companies and in 84 cases (23%) Swiss companies were acquired by foreign companies. For 2021 KPMG expects a “moderate” development in the M&A market, predicting momentum to increase in the e-commerce sector in particular.
2021-01-21;Why does Davos Man get it so wrong?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/why-does-davos-man-get-it-so-wrong-/46305508;"The World Economic Forum should put global leaders in the audience to listen to social workers, virologists and reporters, argues Simon Kuper. We don’t know yet what will happen in 2021, because the World Economic Forum’s meeting in Davos has been called off. Normally at this time of year, political and business leaders gather in the Swiss ski resort to reveal the future. Now we’ll only discover what’s coming when they meet in Singapore in May. Actually, scratch that: most Davos predictions are worthless. There is no VIP crystal ball. My aim here isn’t to mock Davos – that’s too easy. I’ll even skip the ritual joke about rich men arriving on private planes to discuss climate change, sexism and inequality. My only question is: how to improve the Davos product? First, let’s review past predictions. In January 2008, as the subprime crisis unfolded, Davos buzzed with confidence, nicely articulated by Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics: “It is inconceivable – repeat, inconceivable – to get a world recession.” To be fair, the forum’s 54-page Global Risks Report did include two paragraphs on subprime mortgages. By January 2016, the referendum on Brexit was expected that year, while Donald Trump was the most-discussed Republican presidential candidate, about to win the New Hampshire primary. Yet that month’s mentioned neither risk. With everyone at Davos saying a Trump presidency couldn’t happen, economist Ken Rogoff suddenly realised it could. He told Bloomberg: “No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is.” Leaping nimbly from blindness to power worship, Davos then welcomed Trump whenever he dropped in to spout falsehoods. On January 21 2020, last year’s opening day, the WEF’s founder Klaus Schwab thanked the already impeached president for “injecting optimism” into the global discourse. “We need dreams,” exulted Schwab. By January 22, CNN was running “live coronavirus updates” on Chinese lockdowns, mandatory face masks and the virus’s arrival in the US – none of it mentioned by Trump or indeed almost any speakers at Davos. The panel titled “The Next Super Bug”, a tour d’horizon of biological threats, did very briefly address the actual next super bug. One panellist, Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said the coronavirus could “potentially cause tens, hundreds of thousands of deaths, or even millions”. That thought was left unexamined. Later, Hatchett added soothing words about the Wuhan outbreak: “You’re about to see social reactions that are probably going to be disproportionate to the current threat... You can’t predict what the next disease is going to be, by definition. You can’t predict when it’s going to happen.” It was already happening. I don’t expect Davos to reveal the future. Almost all longer-term predictions (including mine, when I’ve been stupid enough to make any) are wrong. But Philip Tetlock, the psychologist who studies forecasting, told Davos in 2017 that skilled forecasters could illuminate the short term, specifically the “three- to 18-month range”. The WEF, to its credit, summoned Tetlock to explain why Davos kept getting things wrong. He offered faint reassurance: “The notion that Davos Man is always wrong, that’s actually not true. It’s very, very difficult to do worse than chance. Whether the Davos Man is more accurate than the dart-throwing chimpanzee is another question.” Masters of the universe are poor forecasters. That’s probably because of groupthink and because of Tetlock’s insight that famous and self- confident people are especially bad at predicting. They talk their own books and they are far from the coalface. In 2016 a panel of Davos Men’s chauffeurs might have done better at predicting Trump. Perhaps the purpose of Davos is networking, but then why bother generating misinformation? A smarter summit would stick world leaders in the audience while social workers, virologists and reporters recounted recent trends. Davos should fly in Arieh Kovler, a corporate communications consultant in Jerusalem, who tweeted on December 21, after studying pro-Trump online forums: “On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump’s orders. It’s highly likely that they’ll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden’s win.” For insights into the distant future, “leaders” should defer to creative types. After 9/11, the Pentagon wisely brainstormed with representatives from Hollywood about possible future attacks. TV show in 2000 foresaw a Trump presidency causing a budget crisis. In 1995, the astronomer, writer and poet Carl Sagan expressed his “foreboding” of a future America “when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues”. He foresaw “pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance”, while the US slid, “almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness”. Post-pandemic, we need to re-engineer our world. Much of this will be difficult. Some of it, like ditching Davos, is surprisingly easy. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021"
2021-01-21;How vaccine technology, choice and supply work in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-vaccine-technology--choice-and-supply-work-in-switzerland/46286164;"The Swiss Covid-19 vaccination campaign is up and running with two approved vaccines available to accelerate the fight against the virus, and others set to follow. How do the vaccine technologies work and compare, and can people choose which one they get? So far, there are two vaccines available in Switzerland, those from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Demand far outstrips supply, but the recent approval of Moderna’s vaccine by regulator Swissmedic means that Switzerland “can now significantly increase our vaccination campaign”, according to Christoph Berger, president of the Federal Commission for Vaccinations. The Swiss campaign has been hit by a temporary delay to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Europe. But this will not affect the country’s overall goal of inoculating all at-risk groups by the end of March, say Swiss health officials. The two approved vaccines are very similar. Both use new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which contains instructions for human cells to make harmless spike proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus. The instructions spur the immune system into action, prompting it to make antibodies and activate T-cells (a type of white blood cell) to fight the coronavirus. No actual live Covid-19 virus is contained in the vaccines and the mRNA, protected in oily bubbles of lipid nanoparticles, never enters the nucleus of the cell where our DNA is kept. Trials have shown both mRNA vaccines to be highly effective (see graphic below). The main differences are how they are administered and stored. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit). Once thawed, it can only be refrigerated for five days. The vaccine requires a special shipping container packed with dry ice to keep it at the proper temperature. Moderna's vaccine can be stored at standard freezer temperatures of -20C (-4F) for up to six months. After it's thawed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days. “The storage and transportation [of the Moderna vaccine] are simpler, and its already in liquid form with ten doses per vial [compared to five for Pfizer/BioNTech that has to be carefully prepared],” explained Patrick Genoud, coordinator of Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) vaccination centre. “We can prepare the Moderna shots beforehand and transport them from one old people’s home to another with much greater flexibility.” The next Covid-19 vaccine in the Swiss pipeline could be the one developed by the University of Oxford and the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca. A clinical trial revealed that the vaccine was 62-90% effective, depending on the initial dosage. Britain began vaccinating its population with Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid shots on January 4. It could win Swiss regulatory approval as early as this month, the NZZ newspaper reported last weekend. The AstraZeneca shot is a viral vector vaccine and uses a different well-established technology. Researchers have taken genes for the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus and put them into a harmless version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been altered to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness. When the vaccine is injected, it prompts the immune system to start making antibodies and prepares it to attack any coronavirus infection. As well as being much cheaper (see infobox below), the AstraZeneca shot doesn't require deep freezing. It can be kept in a standard refrigerator for six months. The fourth vaccine being reviewed by Swissmedic is from pharmaceutical company Janssen-Cilag, which is part of the Johnson & Johnson Group. The candidate, another viral vector vaccine similar to the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, is still advancing through clinical trials. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to the US government programme to develop and distribute Covid-19 vaccines, said the vaccine is expected to show efficacy at or above 80%. The advantage of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is that it requires just a single dose, and it can be transported and stored at 2-8C for three months and will last for two years if kept at -20C. If trials show the vaccine is effective, the company could apply for emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in February. A senior EU official recently told Reuters that it could be available in Europe in April. Johnson & Johnson submitted an applicationExternal link to the Swiss regulator for its vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S in December. Blaise Genton, head of infectious diseases at Lausanne’s university medical centre Unisanté, believes patients probably won’t be able to choose which vaccine they get as more are rolled out. In some special cases the decision will fall to the patient’s doctor. “There will probably be different indications for specific vaccines, such as for people with severe allergies, for whom mRNA vaccines are inappropriate and who might benefit from the Oxford/AstraZeneca, for example,” he declared. As well as allergies, age may also be a deciding factor. Pfizer can be used from 16 years onwards, while the others are from 18, for example. Experts say there are no major differences between the approved vaccines in terms of the protection they offer . “The two mRNA vaccines are very comparable; they are very similar in terms of effectiveness and tolerability,” said Berger. So, it doesn't matter whether a person gets one or the other vaccine.” Virginie Masserey, who heads infectious diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health, agreed. “It is assumed that vaccines will be equivalent in terms of efficacy and safety, so it is rather the availability of the vaccine that will be decisive and the citizen will not need to choose,” she said. And some say choice may be a luxury that countries can’t afford, with new variants of Covid-19 emerging and the virus continuing to spread. I would say at this moment that every vaccine with relatively good efficacy - that means, at least 60 or 70% - should be put to use, when it has an appropriate safety profile,” said Thomas Klimkait, a University of Basel professor and researcher. Drug regulator Swissmedic closely monitors the safety of new vaccines. While some countries have rushed to grant approval for vaccines, Switzerland has taken a more cautious approach (Pfizer was approved on December 1 in UK and on December 20 in Switzerland; Moderna was approved on December 19 in US and on January 12 in Switzerland). In December, Swissmedic said emergency approval processes being used by some countries to speed up the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines were not a legal option in Switzerland. So far, no significant concerns have been reported, but nothing is 100% safe. Swissmedic says the side effects documented most frequently for Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were “comparable with those after a flu vaccination (fatigue, headache, chills and muscle pain.) Steve Pascolo, an immunologist at University Hospital Zurich, has been working with mRNA vaccines for over 20 years. He is convinced of the technology’s safety and does not expect any long-term side effects. “The mRNA is very stable in the test tube in the laboratory. In the body, however, it is broken down very quickly by enzymes. So, what is injected is broken down by the body in a few hours, so that after a day or two there are no more traces of it,” he told Swiss public television, SRF. Genton is also relaxed about the different technologies. He said he would be willing to take “any of the three vaccines” (Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca). He emphasised that the ultra-fast research process had not in any way been “botched” or simplified. “I know the vector viral vaccine as I'm familiar with the Ebola vaccine and I’ve worked a lot with malaria vaccines,” he said. “We've used this technology for 15 years. The Oxford team has even tested it on infants, so we should be reassured.” But some Swiss immunologists, who have been trying to develop Covid-19 vaccines themselves, have certain reservations about the new mRNA technology, the procedures and substances used or even the possible long-term consequences. “We don’t know whether it will cause long-term problems say for one person out of 20,000 in the next three years,” Bern University immunologist Martin Bachmann told SRF. Covid-19 vaccine scepticism among Swiss health professionals appears to mirror that for the flu vaccine. A survey of 4,000 people in canton Neuchâtel last December revealed that 75% of doctors said they would get a Covid-19 jab, but the number fell to 36% for nurses."
2021-01-20;British Covid strain detected in Switzerland in October;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/british-covid-strain-detected-in-switzerland-in-october/46303722;The British mutation of the coronavirus first appeared in Switzerland in October, two months earlier than previously thought, the federal health office has confirmed. So far 479 infections with mutated coronaviruses have been recorded in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The British mutation B1.1.7, which is believed to be more infectious but not more dangerous than the initial strain, has infected 281 people, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Wednesday. Twelve infections could be attributed to the South African variant B1.351. In addition, the FOPH said it had counted 186 infections caused by a coronavirus with an unexplained mutation line. The office also confirmed media reports that the British mutation had been detected in a sample from canton Vaud in western Switzerland on October 26 and reported on January 5. Until now the authorities had assumed a first occurrence of this virus variant at the beginning of December on the basis of wastewater samples. The highest number of infections with mutations of the virus, 109, occurred in canton Bern, the FOPH said. The mutations are widespread in 18 cantons and in neighbouring Liechtenstein. However, the figures should be taken with caution, it added. The figures represented significant underestimates in cantons where gene sequencing was used to search for mutations in only a few or no samples.
2021-01-20;Schools should stay open for now, say educators and scientists;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/schools-should-stay-open--say-educators-and-scientific-task-force/46303022;Compulsory and post-compulsory schools in Switzerland should not be closed immediately because of Covid-19, according to the government’s scientific taskforce and the Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education. The conference’s conclusions, which were presented to the government on Wednesday, state that the cantons expect to keep schools open at both primary and secondary level. Closing schools would have a negative impact both on the mental health of children and young people and on their schooling, it said. For its part, the government said it didn’t plan to take over decision-making when it came to education. “It’s up to the cantons,” Guy Parmelin, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, said at a media conference on Wednesday. The government’s scientific taskforce believes that distance learning should only be ordered if the epidemiological situation becomes dangerous or very dangerous. And it should be limited to secondary education. “The measures taken to date have prevented major outbreaks in schools,” Parmelin said. However, further measures may be necessary if new variants of the coronavirus were to spread widely.
2021-01-19;Switzerland’s stop-and-go march to vaccinate everyone by the summer;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-s-stop-and-go-march-to-vaccinate-everyone-by-the-summer/46297784;After a sluggish start, Switzerland’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign is picking up steam, with the goal to vaccinate anyone who wants to by summer. But its highly decentralised approach brings challenges. Susanne Kuratli’s son set his alarm for 2am on Friday, January 8 – the first day people could sign up for vaccine appointments in Canton Bern. After filling out all the required information about his mother’s age, insurance and health conditions in the online registration page, appointment slots started appearing and disappearing faster than he could type. He clicked accept as quickly as he could, securing an appointment for his 80-year old mother two days after the opening of Bern’s first vaccination centre on January 11. “I feel great. I have the vaccine behind me, and I feel a little safer,” Kuratli told swissinfo.ch. “I wanted to get the vaccine as soon as possible to protect myself and others. I thought if I can free up a hospital bed for someone, I should do it.” The process hasn’t gone as smoothly for everyone. The first few weeks of the vaccine campaign were filled with jammed phone lines, technical glitches and a frustrated public wondering why some parts of the country were starting faster than others. A month after the first Covid-19 vaccination in Switzerland, there still isn’t a full nationwide picture of the number of people who have been vaccinated. Initial figures show that around 110,000 doses have been administered as of January 18 (1.27% of the population). By the end of the month, the government aims to reach 4% of the population, which is less than what Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom have managed to inoculate already. Federal authorities have reassured an impatient public that they are on track to vaccinate anyone who wants to (estimated 6 million people) by the end of June. It got a boost last week when the Swiss drug regulator Swissmedic authorised the Moderna vaccine – the second vaccine after Pfizer/BioNtech. The country now faces the daunting task of fixing existing problems while massively scaling up vaccination. As the country heads into a partial lockdown under the threat of a new strain, the task is even more urgent. Switzerland gave the greenlight to the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine on December 19, a few weeks before it had planned to launch the official vaccination campaign. The deal with Pfizer was only concluded less than two weeks earlier but this was still a month after Israel’s deal with the company, and for less than half the number of doses. The authorisation was good news for the Swiss, but the late notice surprised some cantons and led to a mad dash to start vaccinating with less than perfect IT systems and infrastructure according to someone involved in organising a cantonal vaccine campaign. “We were planning to start in January, but when other cantons started vaccinating in December, we faced a lot of pressure from cantonal authorities to do so as well,” said the person who wished to remain anonymous. The first Pfizer shipment included 234,000 doses – enough to vaccinate about 115,000 people. Distributed across 26 cantons based on population this meant that by January 13, Appenzell Innerrhoden, the smallest canton in Switzerland, received 400 doses, while cantons Lucerne had 10,000 and Vaud more than 19,000, spokespeople from those cantons confirmed with swissinfo.ch. The initial Pfizer doses were the only ones available until last week when some 200,000 doses of Moderna arrived. Another 126,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine were expected to arrive on January 18 but a production bottleneck reported on Friday meant only about half arrived. By the end of February, the government said a total of 1.5 million doses should be available, covering almost 11% of the adult population. As we reported in December, rolling out vaccines to the masses could take months if not years as a result of limited manufacturing capacity. The 15.8 million doses ordered by the Swiss government from three manufacturers (the third is AstraZeneca) will be delivered when they are ready, sometimes with little warning, making it difficult for cantons to plan. Several cantons contacted by swissinfo.ch before January 13 said they know the number of doses the government has promised to deliver to them by the end of February but don’t know exactly when they will be delivered or the number of doses in each delivery. Most of them stressed that many factors were out of their control. “How and when the registration for vaccination can be opened for each target group depends on various factors, such as the quantity and type of available vaccine doses and substances, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated or the spread of the coronavirus,” summed up a spokesperson from canton Thurgau. In contrast to Israel, which also has a population of around 8 million, Switzerland’s rollout is highly decentralised. The federal government secures and delivers doses and sets the overall vaccine strategy, but the 26 cantons are responsible for executing it. Denmark, the UAE, Bahrain and Israel have all achieved higher vaccine rates than Switzerland with more centralised approaches. Some 29% of the population in Israel has received at least a first vaccine dose – far more than any other country. For a highly decentralised approach like Switzerland’s to work, there has to be good two-way information flow, Prashant Yadav, a health and supply chain expert at the Centre for Global Development, told swissinfo.ch. The government gives cantons advanced warning when a shipment will arrive, but cantons are expected to report back how many doses are used. Yadav argues that the backbone to such information flow is a strong IT system – something that is lacking in Switzerland according to sources and media reports. The public is told to visit their cantonal website to make an appointment, but this can be everything from a telephone line as in the southern canton of Ticino to a fully digitalised online questionnaire and appointment system in Bern and Geneva. The system used in Canton Zurich crashedExternal link in just a few hours after thousands of people tried to make an appointment. Appointments for January are now fully-booked and the system is not expected to be back online to take appointments until the end of the month. In an interview in the German-language paper Neue Zürcher ZeitungExternal link on January 5, Sang-Il Kim who heads digital transformation at the federal health office, said the government is pilot testing the online system OneDoc for registrations, appointment scheduling and vaccination data management for all cantons but there have been delays.  Four cantons have requested their own system, complicating the process, he admitted. In contrast, Israel’s digital medical records are centralised and used to identify people eligible for the vaccine, who then receive a text message with a link to make an appointment via an app. Everyone in Denmark has a digital personal information number that helps the government identify eligible people and map vaccination priorities. Covid-19 requires more than an IT system though, said Yadav. “It is more about having a culture of trust and accountability” that information will be tracked, reported and used consistently and appropriately. This is complicated by the fact that Switzerland doesn’t have a digital national immunisation register to rely on in contrast to many countries such as the Netherlands. The government encourages people to self-report in an electronic vaccine certificate (meinimpfung.ch) but this is largely for personal use, not for national monitoring. Estimates of vaccine coverage are based on regular surveysExternal link led by the University of Zurich with the cantons.   Irrespective of what has been negotiated with suppliers, vaccine supplies are arriving slowly, not just in Switzerland, making it difficult to match supply and demand. “Originally countries said we need to do this sequentially, which is vaccinate everyone of a certain group followed by the next group. And sequential works if you know that demand is clear but what countries are realising is that not everyone in phase 1 wants it. Then you have a surplus,” Yadav said. He argued that simultaneous rollouts are possible, just as is happening in some US states. But Switzerland remains cautious about opening the floodgates for people outside high-risk groups including people 75 years and up from getting the vaccine until they have a clearer picture on supplies. Canton Ticino has restricted the first doses even further to those 85 and up. The decentralised approach is also allowing some cantons to diverge from national recommendations. Canton Vaud just announced it won’t allow people who have had a coronavirus infection to receive a vaccine right now, which runs counter to federal recommendations. The federal health office has also not specified when the general public could get the jab but canton Lucerne has already published a projected timelineExternal link for vaccinations with the general population scheduled for June. “I don't think there is a one right answer on who should be vaccinated first,” Daniel Chulwoo Rhee from the International Vaccine Institute in South Korea told swissinfo.ch. “Once vaccines are refrigerated, they have to be administered as soon as possible. If the government deviates from its priority groups, it has to be clear about why it took the decision.” Cantons contacted by swissinfo.ch said that they are vaccinating other groups to avoid wasting any doses. Michel Hassler, communication director of canton Aargau's Health Department, said that in his canton, leftover vaccine doses are used to vaccinate staff in intensive care units in the evening. Zug also said they will vaccinate healthcare workers if doses remain. Decentralisation does have advantages: it allows cantons to decide how best to use their resources to reach people. Many are transforming Covid-19 testing centres built in empty sports stadiums or warehouses into vaccine centres with the capacity to provide in some cases up to several thousands (in Bern for example) doses per day. Canton Vaud has six vaccine centres – all located in hospitals. Some have exclusively focused on nursing homes or care facilities using mobile teams that go directly to homes. In Lucerne, around 90% of nursing home residents (around 4,200) had been vaccinated by January 15. Monique Lehky Hagen, who is part of the medical society in Canton Valais, told Swiss public television RTS the strategyExternal link in her canton to focus on vaccination in doctors’ offices allows them to be more targeted with limited supplies and to help convince patients to get vaccinated. While the Swiss army is protecting and delivering vaccine doses, stored in freezers at an undisclosed army location, cantons can also call on the civil protection corps to support their campaigns with tasks such as organising appointments at nursing homes where needed. Cantons St Gallen, Basel and Appenzell Ausserrhoden have opted to hire pharma logistics firm Galliker to transport vaccines at cold temperatures. According to media reportsExternal link on the weekend, Health Minister Alain Berset is considering redistributing vaccines from low-performing to higher performing cantons in hopes of incentivising a faster roll-out. Some cantonal doctors have expressed support for a more “dynamic managementExternal link” or distribution of vaccine doses rather than based purely on population.  Trust is also an issue to take into consideration. The federal government has to strike a balance between the desire to move quickly and the need to mobilise the population. Although there is a sense of urgency to roll the vaccines out, the perception that corners were cut to speed things ahead could erode public trust. “Safety issues may arise, and that message has to come from the federal government to ensure there isn’t any miscommunication”, said Daniel Chulwoo Rhee from the International Vaccine Institute. The latest survey by swissinfo.ch’s parent company SRG shows that 41% of the population would get a Covid-19 vaccine immediately compared with just 16% in October. This is still lower than what is found in Denmark. One surveyExternal link found 79% of Danes were willing to receive the coronavirus vaccine. Although its rollout has not been as fast or as smooth as some would hope, Switzerland is still part of a select group of around 40 wealthy countries that have received any doses at all. “It is a privilege to get vaccinated. This is a chance for us older people. I’m very proud that I can be an example for others,” said Susanne Kuratli. 
2021-01-18;Five steps to keep the Swiss watchmaking industry ticking;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/five-steps-to-keep-the-swiss-watchmaking-industry-ticking/46283630;After going through one of their worst years on record, Swiss watchmakers are hoping to get their heads above water in 2021. Here are the five main challenges that the industry will have to face in order not to sink into lasting depression. Let’s start with the good news: 2021 will undoubtedly be a better year for Swiss watchmakers than the previous one. “We are expecting an upward trend, although there are still many unknowns. Everything will hinge on how the pandemic evolves, how fast vaccination campaigns are carried out and when global tourism starts to recover,” the president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FH), Jean-Daniel Pasche, commented.  In 2020 the sector experienced the worst crisis of the last 80 years, with a drop in watch exports of around 25% (the final figures will be known in late January). The closure of many shops around the world and the shutdown of international tourism have taken a heavy toll on this flagship industry, which exports 95% of its output worldwide.  While the sector has so far managed to limit the damage at the human level – only a few bankruptcies and a 2.6% drop in watchmaking jobs were recorded last year – it could be facing difficult months ahead, despite a gradual upturn in activity. “Massive State aid has masked the true extent of the crisis suffered by the branch. Waves of layoffs and the demise of dozens of brands can be expected once short-time work and business loans have ended,” warned Grégory Pons, a French journalist based in Geneva who specializes in watchmaking. In 2020, the only real good news for Swiss watchmaking came from the Far East. While all global markets plummeted, exports to China followed the reverse trend and increased by nearly one fifth compared to 2019. Thanks to tough measures and a harsh lockdown, China was able to reopen its shops already in the spring. Deprived of foreign travel, Chinese consumers turned to buying watches at home.  “This is a new phenomenon, which is not just linked to the coronavirus crisis. There is a clear desire by Beijing to boost local trade, with the establishment of duty-free zones for the Chinese population, in particular on Hainan island,” explains Jean-Daniel Pasche.  This eastward shift is expected to continue, especially since international tourism is unlikely to resume before the end of the year. This comes with the risk of more disappointments ahead for Swiss watchmakers, as happened after the boom in exports to China in the early 2010s.   “This dependence on the Chinese market is dangerous. Part of the Chinese elite has made a lot of money out of this crisis and is investing some of it in Swiss watches. But just wait for the bubble to burst,” warned Grégory Pons. He fears that Beijing will launch another major anti-corruption campaign, with the unstated aim of promoting the sale of Chinese watches, to the detriment of Swiss timepieces. For slightly over a decade, Swiss watchmakers have banked heavily on the rapid growth of emerging economies, particularly in Asia, to gain market share. This comes at the expense of often neglecting their traditional clientele in Europe and North America. As a result, Swiss watches have come to be seen as outdated by Western fashionistas. “Swiss watch brands are disappearing from the mental universe of Western consumers,” Grégory Pons said.  Meanwhile, connected watches and those produced by fashion brands such as Guess, Puma and Armani are highly popular among trendy youth. Both fun and affordable, “smartwatches” have almost superseded the Swatch and other inexpensive “Swiss Made” watches on the watchmaking scene.  A single statistic illustrates this phenomenon: although it marketed its first Apple Watch only in 2015, the Californian multinational now sells twice as many watches as the whole Swiss watch industry! “Swiss brands, for the most part are very conservative and endlessly turn out the same conventional and bland models. To persuade young consumers to opt for more traditional watches, they will have to be much more creative,” said Grégory Pons. This fierce competition in the entry-level range – that is, watches sold for less than CHF600 ($674) – is having a dramatic impact on the total number of timepieces produced in Switzerland. In the first 11 months of 2020, Swiss watchmakers exported just over 12 million pieces worldwide – that is, nearly three times fewer than in the early 2000s.  “This is the main problem for Swiss watchmakers. An industry cannot rely solely on the high end of the market which. With very few exceptions – such as Rolex (one million units) and Omega (750,000 units) – this leads to limited volume. To keep the machinery running and to finance investments, what you need is volume,” says Olivier Müller, expert watchmaker at LuxeConsult.  Jean-Daniel Pasche is also convinced that the Swiss watch industry must keep manufacturing low-priced watches even if the production costs and the strength of the Swiss franc are major disadvantages. “Volume creates activity and helps keep know-how and jobs in the sector,” he notes. The forced closure of many watch shops around the world has opened the eyes of even the most die-hard watchmakers to the importance of online sales and communication – and this also goes for brands that sell their products at tens of thousands of francs apiece. “It is obviously an advantage to be able to buy online when the shops are closed. More generally, this distribution channel meets the growing needs of part of the population,” said Jean-Daniel Pasche. For example, between April and September, the Geneva luxury group Richemont achieved 7% of its sales via the Internet, against 2% the previous year.  In a matter of a few months, brands have implemented digital strategies that were initially planned to take several years. The use of new means of communication has also enabled watchmakers to connect with their end customers.  Without calling into question the importance of shops and direct contact, this rapid development is helping to shake up an industry that has so far been very resistant to major digital change. But it still took until 2020 and the final push of a virus from China for this to happen. Translated from French by Julia Bassam. 
2021-01-17;Sunday press: government evaluating Covid measures for schools;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sunday-press--government-evaluating-covid-measures-for-schools/46293874;The Swiss government is considering whether to tighten coronavirus measures for older pupils, according to a report in the NZZ am Sonntag. Meanwhile the debate over school closures continues, as concerns grow over the new virus variants. All schools were shut down by the government during the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020. Since then, the Swiss government has left the schools issue to the cantons, who are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland. Unlike other countries, schools are currently open in Switzerland, but under strict hygiene measures and masks from age 12 onwards. The authorities have repeatedly expressed their wish to keep schools open. But there may be some tightening of measures ahead. According to the NZZ am SonntagExternal link, interior minister Alain Berset’s department has asked the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Task Force and the Conference of Cantonal Education Directors for reports on coronavirus measures in schools. The article says the move targets academic baccalaureate schools and vocational schools (age 15-16 onwards) for which the government also has some responsibility under the Swiss federal system. Under discussion: alternating half classes, the use of remote teaching and stopping classes like sports, the newspaper explained. Primary schools are the cantons’ full responsibility, and the government could only intervene when there is an official “special situation” in place as during the first wave of the pandemic, the Federal Office of Public Health told the newspaper. Opinion divided over closures Opinion is divided among experts over whether schools should be closed like in neighbouring Austria and Germany. Current official thinking is that younger primary pupils in particular are not the drivers of the pandemic and that disadvantaged pupils would be greatly impacted by school closures. However, the rise of the new coronavirus variants – Switzerland will go into a semi-lockdown on Monday to stem this – is causing concern. Epidemiologist Marcel Tanner of the science task force told the SonntagsZeitungExternal link that older pupils should go back to distance learning. He recommended more testing of whole classes and even schools. New saliva tests would make this easier for primary schools, Tanner said, but he was against closing primary schools right now. Education expert Stefan Wolter – a new addition to the task force – was also against closing schools, as he told the NZZ am SonntagExternal link.

Situation in schools A survey carried out among 600 head teachers in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and published on SaturdayExternal link by Head Teachers’ Association suggested that in general absences due to pupil illnesses were not higher than normal in January, despite the coronavirus.

2021-01-17;Swiss affected by Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine delay;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-affected-by-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-delay/46293514;Switzerland will be affected by the temporary delay to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Europe, the Swiss health authorities have confirmed. According to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), the delivery expected for this Monday will be smaller, but that the second dose for those who have already received the jab is not at risk. “We don’t expect this. Firstly, because we are still getting deliveries and secondly, because we are following this closely and could as a result slightly delay first vaccinations. But we have not used up all the doses yet,” said FOPH vice director Nora Kronig in an interview with Swiss public television SRFExternal link on Saturday evening. Pfizer confirmed on FridayExternal link that shipments to Europe were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production. As a result, there would be “a temporary reduction in the number of doses delivered in the upcoming week. We will be back to the original schedule of deliveries to the European Union beginning the week of January 25, with increased delivery beginning week of February 15.” The company said it would deliver the fully committed quantity of vaccine doses in the first quarter and significantly more in the second quarter. Several European countries have already expressed their concern at the delay, especially for giving the second dose of the vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be administered twice with a three-week wait between jabs. Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine was cleared for use in Switzerland on December 20. Kronig said that she was concerned about the delay in Belgium given the current tense situation over the coronavirus. Switzerland will go into a semi lockdown on Monday to try and avoid a third wave brought on by faster-spreading variants of the coronavirus. Kronig told SRF that is was all the more important that a second vaccine had been approved in Switzerland and that the country was following a diversified strategy involving several vaccines. Last Tuesday, the health regulator Swissmedic gave the green light for the ‘immediate’ use of the vaccine produced by US company Moderna. According to the tabloid SonntagsBlickExternal link, Moderna will deliver 7.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to Switzerland in batches in the months ahead. This will put the country among the world leaders in inoculating its population, the head of Moderna's European business, Dan Staner, said in an interview with the newspaper. In total, Switzerland has ordered 15.8 million vaccine shots for its population of 8.6 million: 3 million from Pfizer/BioNTech, 7.5 million from Moderna and 5.3 million from Oxford/AstraZeneca. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is awaiting regulatory approval, although the NZZ newspaper reported on SaturdayExternal link this could happen as early as this month, citing unnamed sources. More than 60,000 people in Switzerland have been vaccinated against Covid-19 since late December. The plan is to vaccinate six million people by summer. Kronig said she did not expect this plan to be put at risk by developments. During an online meeting on Saturday, Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset and the cantons - who are in charge of health matters in Switzerland and are responsible for carrying out the vaccinations - have agreed that the pace of the jabs needed to be faster, news agencies reported. According to the NZZ am SonntagExternal link, cantons that are too slow could receive fewer shots as a result, citing several sources close to the government. Those who are faster would receive more.
2021-01-16;Crowds head to ski areas after high snowfall;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/crowds-head-to-ski-areas-after-high-snowfall/46292650;Some Swiss ski regions have reported a big rush as people headed to the slopes on Saturday after heavy snow in large parts of the country. Ski areas remain open under Swiss Covid-19 rules under strict hygiene and distancing rules. Saturday saw good weather and conditions for skiing after the very high level of snowfall on Friday. Some eastern parts of the country experienced up to 80 centimetres of snowfall in 24 hours. There were so many people in Flumserberg in eastern Switzerland that the resort stopped selling tickets in the morning at 10:30 AM after it reached its guest quota, Heinrich Michel, head of the mountain railways there, told Swiss public television SRF, confirming a report in the 20 Minutes freesheet. External link Keystone-SDA pictures of other ski areas, like Verbier in western Switzerland, show crowds of people and Covid protection officers on hand. Some ski areas have brought in extra staff or asked the police and fire service to help, 20 Minutes said. The crowds have put pressure on Covid-19 protection distancing rules in some places, reports and eyewitness accountsExternal link have suggested.   More snow is expected to fall overnight to Sunday. Meanwhile, sports minister Viola Amherd has raised the possibility of closing ski areas depending on how the coronavirus pandemic develops, in interview with CH MediaExternal link. The virus sets the pace. not politics, said the minister. Currently the cantons are in charge of decisions over ski areas. At the moment it was right that resorts were open, but “we have to be flexible”, Amherd said. Switzerland goes into semi-lockdown on Monday, but ski areas will remain open. The previously announced limits on the number of people using mountain railways and cable cars, as well as obligatory mask wearing continue to apply.

Asked for its reaction to the temporary delay, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Friday night: “We are taking the new of the supply bottleneck seriously and are looking into the consequences for Switzerland”. The Swiss government knew from the beginning that the global shortage in vaccine supply would be a challenge, which is why it is following a diversified strategy, the FOPH told several news outlets. “The government is backing several vaccine manufacturers and different vaccine technologies because Covid-19 vaccine development and supply includes many uncertainties,” FOPH spokeswoman Maria Foursova told Swiss public television SRF.External link In total, Switzerland has ordered 15.8 million vaccine shots for its population of 8.6 million: 3 million from Pfizer/BioNTech, 7.5 million from Moderna and 5.3 million from Oxford/AstraZeneca.

2021-01-16;Swiss update travel advice for US after Capitol riot;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-update-travel-advice-for-us-after-capitol-riot/46292030;Switzerland has updated its travel advice for the United States over expected tensions ahead of Joe Biden’s swearing in as the next US president and in the aftermath of the riots in the Capitol on January 6. “In connection with the change in presidency, the US authorities are warning of possible demonstrations and clashes, particularly around government buildings in Washington and in other US states,” the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) said in advice valid from Saturday.External link It made explicit mention of the riot of January 6, in which supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building, citing “several deaths and injuries” (five died as a result of the riots). People should therefore avoid mass events and rallies of any kind and follow instructions issued by local authorities, such as curfews, the FDFA said. The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will take place in Washington on January 20. The FBI has warned of armed protests at state capitols and in Washington DC in the lead-up to the ceremony, resulting in security being ramped up in US capital. Washington DC is already under a state of emergency after the riots at Capitol Hill. Overall, the country is stable, but the FDFA urged caution around demonstrations. There could also be local protests and clashes with security forces, the FDFA warned, pointing to tensions over cases of police force. The US Department of Homeland SecurityExternal link has warned of possible terror attacks, it added. The FDFA also continues to recommend against all non-urgent travel to the US due to the coronavirus pandemic. States have varying travel restrictions in place, it said.
2021-01-11;Lauberhorn ski race cancelled owing to Covid-19 fears;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lauberhorn-ski-race-cancelled-owing-to-covid-19-fears/46277390;Organisers of the iconic Lauberhorn ski race in Switzerland have performed a U-turn and pulled the event in the face of coronavirus uncertainties. It was due to take place this weekend and had only been given the green light on Sunday. On Monday the International Ski Federation (FIS) said it had been advised by the health authorities in canton Bern to cancel the Lauberhorn races after all. “The cancellation of one of the most prestigious race weekends in the World Cup calendar makes the heart of every ski fan bleed,” said Bernhard Aregger, CEO of Swiss-Ski. “However, it is our job to ensure the safety of everyone involved.” Competitors had been due to start arriving on Monday and take part in downhill training from Tuesday. The races originally scheduled for the weekend of January 15-17 included the legendary Lauberhorn run, the oldest and longest race on the FIS Ski World Cup. Organisers say their insurance policy covers the financial losses incurred by this year’s cancellation. The number of new Covid-19 infections in Switzerland has remained stable in recent weeks, even falling slightly. On Monday some 6,523 new cases were reported Swiss-wide over the previous 72 hours. Canton Bern, where the Lauberhorn is staged, reported 164 new cases from the past 24 hours, below the average of the past few weeks. But the cantonal authorities called the race off after analysing the results of tests around the precise area where the race was due to take place, the village of Wengen in central Switzerland. The Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA also reported increased fears of variant strains of the virus being detected in Switzerland. The number of people infected by the British or South African strains has risen from 28 last week to 88 on Monday. In a further 29 cases, unknown mutations of the virus were detected. 
2021-01-11;Covid results in fewer asylum seekers – for now;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-results-in-fewer-asylum-seekers---for-now/46276392;The coronavirus pandemic has been identified as the reason for a significant decline in requests for asylum in Switzerland. The number of applications stood at 11,041 at the start of this year, compared to around 16,000 at the same point in 2020. The head of the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), Mario Gattiker, told the newspaper BlickExternal link on Monday that the drop in applications had saved his office CHF160 million ($181 million) last year. Many countries, including Switzerland, shut down or tightened their borders in 2020 to try and contain the spread of the virus. Transport links were also severely disrupted. But Gattiker believes that Covid-19 will result in an increase in asylum seeker numbers between 2022 and 2025. “There is likely to be increased migration due to coronavirus-related economic downturn in many regions and resulting domestic political tensions. In the medium term, we must therefore assume a significant increase in asylum numbers across Europe,” he told Blick. “Numerous international organisations in the field of migration also expect such increases when the pandemic comes to an end. It is difficult right now to estimate by how much. But we have to keep an eye on this and prepare well.” Last autumn, some asylum centres in Switzerland warned that they had nearly reached capacity. This was the result of an uptick in migration numbers between pandemic waves, combined with centres having to operate social distancing rules. Gattiker said there are currently 2,500 beds free at asylum centres. This is enough to process some 15,000 applicants over the course of the year. There is a contingency plan in place to boost the number of beds to 8,000 to cope with more than 30,000 applicants, Gattiker added
2021-01-10;Lauberhorn ski races get green light despite more Covid cases;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lauberhorn-ski-races-get-green-light-despite-more-covid-cases/46275322;This year’s edition of the FIS Ski World Cup in the Swiss resort of Wengen is to go ahead next weekend as planned, despite a recent rise in coronavirus cases there. Doubts had been raised over the weekend because of the rise in Covid-19 infections, including the new more infectious strain reportedly brought in by British tourists in Wengen. But after consultations, authorities announced on Sunday that it will go ahead. However, there will be no public, no hospitality on site, and comprehensive testing, they say. Swiss Ski President Urs Lehmann said he was extremely relieved” that all parties had given a green light. “The specialists from canton Bern did an excellent job and found out where the source of the virus was,” he said. “The situation in Wengen is under control, thanks to comprehensive tests that will continue to be carried out. That's why we can be confident. Athletes are due to start arriving on Monday and the first downhill training is scheduled for Tuesday. The January 15-17 international events include the legendary Lauberhorn run, the oldest and longest race on the FIS Ski World Cup. 
2021-01-10;Covid-hit restaurants call for 'compensation now';https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-hit-restaurants-call-for--compensation-now-/46275098;Half of all hotel and restaurant businesses in Switzerland will go bankrupt by the end of March if they do not receive immediate financial compensation for the effects of coronavirus restrictions, warns the sector’s umbrella organisation. Based on a survey of more than 4,000 of its members, GastroSuisse says 98% of its members need support, and that “with each wave of coronavirus comes a wave of redundancies”. “In November and December, there was a second wave of redundancies in the hotel and catering industry,” it said in a press releaseExternal link on Sunday.  Almost 60% of businesses that laid off staff during the year had to do so again at the end of 2020, according to GastroSuisse. “So it is up to the federal government to avert a countrywide disaster and a third wave of job losses in the hotel and restaurant sector.” GastroSuisse says it rightly warned in October that 100,000 jobs were at risk. “In the last months, the situation has again worsened particularly because of the government’s incomprehensible decision to close restaurants.” After the first shutdown in spring 2020, all restaurants across Switzerland have again been closed since December 22. Initially announced for a month, the federal government is now considering extending the shutdown until March, with an announcement expected on January 13. It is also expected to announce new measures to help cushion the economic effects on affected sectors, which also include sports and cultural facilities. Although the federal government has provided economic assistance to cushion the effects of its coronavirus measures, many operators, especially small businesses, complain that the process is slow and bureaucratic, and the aid not enough.  
2021-01-10;Swiss economy to boom, says top government expert;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-economy-to-boom--says-top-government-expert/46274944;The Swiss economy has held up well in the face of the Covid-19 crisis and could even boom this year, says a top government economist. Eric Scheidegger, director of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, told the NZZ am Sonntag that the outlook for 2021 is good, despite the current shutdown of some sectors. In an interview with the newspaper he predicts that the Swiss economy will grow by 3% or even 4% this year. “We expect the containment of the virus to succeed and vaccination to enable a rapid and strong recovery from spring onwards,” he says. The crisis only caused the Swiss economy to shrink by 3% last year, compared with 6% for neighbouring Germany and Austria and 9% for France and Italy, he says. This can be explained by the fact that Switzerland’s spring lockdown was less strict than in France, for example. “In addition, we reopened the shops more quickly,” Scheidegger told the NZZ am Sonntag. “In general, domestically-oriented companies recovered very quickly in the summer. Domestic tourists also helped. Switzerland's industry structure, with its large share of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, also proved a stabilising factor.” He says the second wave of coronavirus infections in late 2020 has had much less of an impact on Swiss consumer behaviour than the first. And the feared wave of layoffs has not happened so far, thanks partly to short-time working subsidies. “In contrast to the spring, global trade is much more robust. China is growing strongly again, which helps exporters,” says Scheidegger. However, the European market remains crucial for Switzerland, he points out. “The recovery there needs more time.” 
2021-01-09;Last Swiss canton opens ski resorts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/last-swiss-canton-opens-ski-resorts/46273556;Solothurn has become the last Swiss canton to open its ski resorts, despite what it says is a worrying coronavirus situation. Resorts in this north-western canton can operate as of Saturday, after its authorities granted the necessary permits. The canton had on December 21 rejected permit applications, but said on Friday that since all other cantons had opened their ski areas in the meantime, Solothurn ski lift operators would now also be able to operate.   The canton nevertheless said that the number of cases is still too high and that the capacities of hospitals were still at their limit. As one of several requirements, the canton demands that ski resort employees who are in direct contact with customers undergo a weekly coronavirus test. The federal government announced in early December that ski areas were being allowed to open but that resorts would need permits from cantonal governments as of December 22. “The prerequisite is that the epidemiological situation so allows, and that hospitals, contact tracing services and testing sites have sufficient capacity,” it said. The federal government has not fixed any limits on the number of visitors allowed into resorts. But all enclosed ski transport, like gondolas and trains, is limited to two-thirds capacity, and cantons have a duty to monitor compliance. Health Minister Alain Berset said the decision to keep Swiss resorts open was designed above all for people living in Switzerland...not beyond that . Switzerland's approach has led to friction with some neighbouring countries.  
2021-01-08;Swiss National Bank expects profit of CHF21 billion for 2020;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-national-bank-expects-profit-of-chf21-billion-for-2020/46270722;The Swiss National Bank (SNB) expects to post an annual profit of CHF21 billion ($23 billion) for 2020, it said on Friday. Rising stock prices had boosted the value of its huge foreign currency investments. The SNB made a profit of CHF13 billion from its foreign currency positions and saw a valuation gain of CHF7 billion from the 1,040 tonnes of gold it holds, according to preliminary figures announced in a statementExternal link. The SNB’s profit was lower than the CHF48.9 billion it posted for 2019, as a weakening dollar reduced the level of profits when translated into francs. However, the profit means the SNB can distribute CHF4 billion to the Swiss government and cantons, the same level as last year. It also proposed a dividend of CHF15 per share, the legal maximum. The distribution of profits is regulated by a convention drawn up between the finance ministry and the SNB. For the period 2016-2020, the convention states, at least CHF1 billion must be paid to cantons and the government when reserves are positive. Making a profit is not part of the SNB’s mandate, which targets price stability while supporting the overall Swiss economy.  As part of this goal the central bank has been waging a long campaign to reduce the value of the franc, which is sought by investors in times of geopolitical uncertainty but whose strength weighs on the export-reliant economy.  Profits have increased drastically since 2008, something also explained by the increased activity of the SNB in currency and international markets. The value of Switzerland’s foreign currency and gold positions rose during the coronavirus pandemic last year as investors sought safe havens like gold and stock markets were boosted by low interest rates. The Swiss central bank was forced to step into currency markets last year to stop the franc appreciating as investors flocked to safety amid pandemic fears. This triggered a stern response from the outgoing Trump administration in the US: it is officially labelled as an exchange-rate manipulator. The SNB has shrugged off being put on the naughty step. Through its intervention programme, the SNB reportedly holds around CHF770 billion in foreign currency. The central bank’s foreign equity portfolio alone, worth CHF150 billion, makes it the eighth-largest single investor in companies globally.
2021-01-06;Covid: Swiss government plans further restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid--swiss-government-plans-further-restrictions/46264584;Restaurants and leisure venues in Switzerland look set to remain closed until March in a bid to halt an expected rise in Covid-19 infections. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the pandemic situation in Switzerland was serious despite restrictions introduced last month. “The infections have remained at more or less the same level since the beginning of December,” Berset told a news conference on Wednesday. The government has prepared a series of proposals, notably extending the closure of restaurants, bars, culture venues and sports across the country until the end of February. A final decision will be taken next week following consultations with the 26 cantons, employers’ organisations and trade unions. Berset, whose portfolio includes health matters, said the government was aware of the difficult situation, especially faced by the restaurant sector, culture organisations and sports clubs. He said additional economic aid was being considered to cushion the impact of the restrictions. However, he said the restrictions in Switzerland remained less strict than in many other European countries even if the rate of infections, deaths or hospitalisations is comparatively high. Rejecting criticism Confronted with criticism about the government’s vaccination policy, Berset reiterated that Switzerland had placed orders for more than 15 million jabs for a population of 8.5 million residents. He said a supply of 500,000 doses of vaccine would arrive in Switzerland by the end of this month and an additional one million doses by March. Berset also rejected criticism about “half-hearted measures” in the face of the epidemic and the threat of rapidly rising infections in the next few weeks due to the spread of more contagious new strains of coronavirus from Britain and South Africa. “The government’s aim has always been to reduce suffering and harm for everybody in Switzerland,” he said. The government had to take into account the interests of many sectors of society and the economy, he added. Berset said the Swiss political system and its federalist structure, as well as the legal basis, made it necessary for the national government to include the cantons in its decisions. “This is very demanding,” Berset said.
2021-01-05;Pandemic takes toll on winter sports operators ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-takes-toll-on-winter-sports-operators-/46262242;The Jungfraubahn lift company, which carries people to the top destination in the Bernese Alps, recorded a drop of more than 65% in visitors last year, due to the coronavirus pandemic.   Its visitors totalled only 362,800 people in 2020, compared with more than a million in 2019, including a large Asian clientele.   The carrier said on Tuesday that it had suffered from the 83 days of closure imposed by restrictions to combat the pandemic. Nearly half of its 2020 visitors came during the summer months (153,000 people), and most of them were Swiss.   But the increased presence of Swiss tourists was not able to compensate for the absence of Asian customers. In the summer months, around 95% of visitors came from Switzerland,  said Managing Director Urs Kessler, adding that with more local customers, we have become more dependent on the weather .  Meanwhile, businesses in winter sports stations report revenue down 11% during the end of year holiday season compared with the same period last year, according to a survey by Switzerland Tourism. They say that although many local people came, this did not make up for the relative absence of foreign visitors.   
2021-01-05;Charity works overtime to support Covid-stricken mountain firms;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/charity-works-overtime-to-support-covid-stricken-mountain-firms/46261762;A Swiss fund that supports small businesses in alpine regions bailed out 100 firms last year that were affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Schweizer Berghilfe (Swiss Mountain Aid) doled out an extra CHF2 million ($2.26 million) to support Covid-hit enterprises. Volunteers put in 15% more hours evaluating and processing the extra demand for financial support, the organisation said on Tuesday. This resulted in experts spending an extra 1,200 hours (or 150 days) visiting each project in mountain regions to determine whether they should receive support. In normal years, evaluators give around 8,500 hours of their own time to assess applicants. Last year, as a result of the pandemic, the number of volunteer hours approached the 10,000 mark. “Personal contact is key. This is the only way to clarify the motivation of the applicant. You can see the whole site, the installations, you see how the people work and what they are like. That is essential,” said Pierre Praz, an experienced evaluator with Schweizer BerghilfeExternal link. The non-profit organisation was established in 1943 to provide support to mountain communities and relies on public donations. Its goal is to help small and micro businesses flourish in remote regions, which in turn boosts local economies, provides employment and helps stop younger people leaving in search of better opportunities. The fund typically gives out CHF35 million per year supporting on average 600 businesses, such as cheese makers and skilled craft workers. 
2021-01-04;Covid-19: school closures ‘could be an option’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--school-closures--could-be-an-option-/46259914;"Many pupils in Switzerland are returning to school after the holidays on Monday, unlike in some neighbouring countries, which have delayed return over fears of worsening outbreaks. Concerns are that more contact among friends and family over the Christmas and New Year could lead to more Covid infections, which could then be brought into schools. Austria and Germany have therefore decided to keep schools closed for longer after the holidays. In the United Kingdom, there has been a huge debate on the issue. Schools are now back in lockdown. In Switzerland, where cantons are in charge of educational and health matters, most pupils went back to school on Monday (only a couple of cantons have decided to delay return for younger pupils by a few days; in canton Zurich, school will resume a week later for older pupils). But the head of the cantonal directors of health has mooted school closures in Switzerland if infection rates continue to rise. The numbers of new cases over the past week – more than 5,000 last Tuesday and more than 4,000 last Wednesday (no case figures were released over the New Year holiday period, it was however confirmed on Monday afternoon that they had risen by 9,665 since last Thursday ) – were worrying, Lukas Engelberger told Swiss public television SRFExternal link. “We have tried to protect schools and work life as much as possible, but we are running out of options,” he added. Work and “if needs be, schools” could be the target of new measures. School “gives a rhythm” to everyday life, so if pupils go back to remote learning, parents will have to stay at home.  But this would be a last resort, Engelberger explained. The Swiss government said on December 30External link that the domestic Covid situation remained “worrying” – two new virus variants (from the UK and South Africa) have reached the country as well – but added there would be no further national measures, since those imposed on December 18External link were “adequate”. Schools, which closed during the spring lockdown, have been open all autumn term and have not been affected by the national measures. Swiss authorities have based their decision regarding schools in part on the belief that children are not drivers of the pandemic, although research on this is divided. Some virologists and epidemiologists in Switzerland have been calling for the government to reconsider school closures. But teachers remain opposed to closures for now. The head of the Union of French-speaking Teachers (SER), Samuel Rohrbach, said that distance learning for compulsory school was “was not the solution unless in the short term to stop the virus spreading. We are not yet ready to continue as we did in spring.” He told Swiss public television RTSExternal link that teaching half classes at a time would be an alternative. The Federation of Swiss Teachers, in the German-speaking part of Switezrland, said that it had been receiving more enquiries from teachers and parents about hygiene measures in schools – there are masks from age 12 for example – and coronavirus transmission. Its general secretary, Franziska Peterhans, told SRFExternal link that it would also prefer schools to stay open if possible, but said that health was always the top priority. It was prepared for closures as a last measure. Swiss officials have held throughout the pandemic that it is better for children’s education if they can attend school in person. This is to avoid disadvantaged pupils in particular from falling behind in their education.  A study has shown that around one-fifth of children fell through the remote learning net during the eight-week spring lockdown when schools were closed."
2021-01-04;Record number of Swiss companies launched in 2020;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/record-number-of-swiss-companies-launched-in-2020/46259712;"The coronavirus pandemic failed to halt a decade-long steady growth in entrepreneurs, who last year founded more new companies than ever in Switzerland. A total of 46,842 new firms were added to the Swiss Commercial Register in 2020: an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous record year of 2019, according to an annual analysis by the Institute for Young Enterprises (IFJ). “Despite Covid-19”, as the IFJ puts it, most Swiss regions saw increases in new firms. Central Switzerland and northwestern regions particularly boomed, as did the Zurich region. The Italian-speaking part of the country, however, which was hard hit by the pandemic, saw a downturn of 10%; the French-speaking area around Lake Geneva also saw a very slight dip. Sectors which profited most were craft trades (16.7%), consulting (10.2%), retail trade (8.6%), real estate (8.1%) and the finance and insurance (6.8%) sectors. The leisure, travel, and sporting sectors had less of a good year. Michele Blasucci, founder of the Startups.ch advisory firm, said in a press release last week that “many people, who have long toyed with the idea of founding their own company, managed to use the crisis as an opportunity and put their plans into action”. Blasucci also reckoned that the waning of the pandemic will in turn lead to a boom in start-ups in more traditional areas which have been affected by restrictions: for example, hospitality, events, travel, and entertainment. According to the IFJ, the number of new firms created annually has been growing steadily over the past decade. In 2011, the number was around 40,000. 2020 was by no means a good year for the Swiss economy: the economiesuisse business association estimated last month that the economy as a whole contracted by 3.5%. Unemployment is also expected to rise from 3.1% to 3.5% this year."
2021-01-03;South African Covid variant reported in southern Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/south-african-covid-variant-reported-in-southern-switzerland/46257338;Health officials in Italian-speaking Switzerland have reported their first case of the South African mutation of the coronavirus. Switzerland has documented at least three cases of the South African variant and ten cases of the variant from Britain, which are apparently more contagious than the original. The infected individual has been placed in isolation, the Ticino authorities said on January 1. The person had travelled to Switzerland from South Africa and had tested positive before Christmas. At least thirteen people in Switzerland have now been detected with the mutant virus, ten with the British version and three with a version detected in South Africa. On December 20 Switzerland banned flights from the UK and South Africa and imposed an entry ban following reports of the new strain of coronavirus. People who had entered Switzerland from those countries since December 14 were ordered to go into a ten-day quarantine. The two variants are reportedly spreading across the world. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says there is not enough information to determine whether the variants could undermine vaccines being rolled out. The Swiss government said on December 30 that the national virus situation remains “worrying with a high level of contamination and the arrival in Switzerland of new strains of the virus”. However, it said it had decided against imposing further restrictions as nationwide measures imposed on December 18 – closure of bars, restaurants, sports and cultural facilities - were “adequate”. The reproduction “R-rate” remains below 1, it said. The Swiss government’s Covid-19 scientific taskforce has meanwhile urged the government to take additional measures. It has called for an immediate reduction in the “sad” number of cases and for widespread testing of the population.
2021-01-01;Swiss president: ‘We must not give up’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-president---we-must-not-give-up-/46256452;After a difficult year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, Switzerland’s new president, Guy Parmelin, has called for national unity to help overcome the many uncertainties ahead. “Our country, like so many others, has had a dark year. The health crisis has hit us hard,” Guy Parmelin said in his New Year's Day speech on Friday. “Many families lost a loved one and were not able to say goodbye as they would have liked. For them 2020 will be forever associated with this painful loss.” The French-speaking economics minister assumed the rotating Swiss presidency for the first time on January 1. In his online addressExternal link, Parmelin recalled the important work being carried out by health workers in nursing homes and hospitals. He also expressed support for people currently on short-time work and others who have lost their jobs due to the virus. “The pandemic has changed our lives by putting people out of work, destroying traditional businesses and putting our education and health systems to the test,” he said. Realism prevented him from making “overly enthusiastic wishes” for 2021, the former farmer from canton Vaud declared. As we move into a new year, there are still “numerous uncertainties” and the situation remains “precarious”, the Swiss president said. But the government is doing its utmost to ensure the country gets back on its feet, he insisted. He said he was optimistic “out of conviction and stressed that the country has resources to help it recover. The 61-year-old minister went on to underline Switzerland’s scientific and business strengths, the importance of education and training, and respect around the world for “Swiss-made” products and services. He ended his speech with a call for national unity. “United, Switzerland is stronger in defending its interests,” he said. “On January 1, we are opening a new page in our history. The current situation will not improve in one fell swoop. But we must not give up…the time has come to stand together.”
2021-01-01;Switzerland’s New Year's revelries muted by Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-s-new-year-s-revelries-muted-by-covid-19/46256310;The Swiss said goodbye to 2020 in a quieter, more intimate fashion. Measures taken to contain the pandemic curtailed celebrations, with official events and fireworks cancelled and large gatherings banned. This New Year’s Eve was celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the Swiss capital Bern, the bells of the cathedral rang out the old year and ushered in 2021. But restrictions imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19 meant there was none of the usual New Year’s Eve shouting and laughter heard on the square outside. The official fireworks display had been cancelled in advance. Likewise in Basel, neither the traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks nor the concert, church service and serving of mulled wine on the banks of the Rhine took place like normal. In Zurich, the “Silvesterzauber Light” in the city centre was also called off. Normally, thousands of people gather in Verbier, canton Valais, to welcome in the new year. But this year the chic ski resort saw a heavy police presence and barriers to dissuade revellers. The start of 2021 was also calm and quiet in the exclusive tourist destinations of St Moritz and Davos in eastern Switzerland. St Moritz has cancelled all New Year’s events because of the pandemic, including the drone show that wowed viewers last year instead of the traditional fireworks. In Villeneuve, canton Vaud, over 100 police were called out to shut down an illegal rave attended by 300 people at the FunPlanet leisure centre. In Zurich the municipal police said they were busy, but no major incidents were reported.
2020-12-30;Swiss continue search for absconded British tourists;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-continue-search-for-absconded-british-tourists/46253588;Swiss cantons are still trying to identify tourists from the UK and South Africa who are staying in their resorts or who fled to escape Covid quarantine. Canton Valais, home to many popular ski resorts such as Verbier and Zermatt, is struggling. At the weekend an estimated 200 British tourists crept out of Verbier during the night, with hotel owners only realising what was going on when they saw breakfast trays outside room doors. The tourists face fines of up to CHF10,000 ($11,280). On December 20 Switzerland halted all flights from Britain and South Africa because a new variant of the coronavirus, thought to be more infectious, had been detected in those countries. The Swiss authorities ordered all arrivals since December 14 to be quarantined retroactively for ten days from the date of arrival. Jean-Bernard Moix, director of Health Promotion Valais, said on Tuesday that 863 people from Britain and 13 from South Africa – 876 in total – had so far been identified on Valais territory. The canton had been notified of 291 arrivals since December 14 via lists drawn up by the Federal Office of Public Health. The other 585 people had been identified by the canton, in particular by tourist offices and municipalities, he said. “But the figure of 876 does not reflect the reality,” Moix said. “It’s missing all those people who didn’t report to the authorities or who weren’t automatically included in the lists during a check.” In Zermatt, for example, according to the data collected, there were 125 tourists from these two countries and in Verbier 114. “But we know there are more.” What’s more, of the 876 people identified, 269 couldn’t be found. “We know that these people were in Valais, but their exact whereabouts are unknown,” he said. So far, seven cases of the new British strain of the coronavirus have been detected in Switzerland, including one in Valais. “The patient mentioned has been identified and further investigations are underway,” Moix said. Moix pointed out that tourists from Britain or South Africa would not be traced after completing their ten-day quarantine and could move around Switzerland freely. “At the moment 351 of the 876 people who were initially identified are still in quarantine. The others have ended their isolation and some have returned home,” he said. Valais took the tracing of British tourists very seriously from the beginning, Moix stressed. He said the Valais health department had sent its lists to the cantonal police, who carried out 150 checks. Twelve people had not stayed at the quarantine address given, he said, adding that they could be reported to the public prosecutor’s office if criminal offences were committed.
2020-12-30;Swiss government decides against further Covid restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-government-decides-against-further-covid-restrictions/46253406;The government says the epidemiological situation in Switzerland remains worrying, but it believes the measures taken on December 18 are appropriate and do not need to be tightened. In a statementExternal link on Wednesday it said would continue to monitor developments closely and would reassess the situation on January 6. On December 18 the government closed all restaurants and bars, sports and recreation centres and other cultural institutions for a month. It controversially allowed cantons to decide whether to let ski areas remain open. The reproduction value of the virus is currently below 1 (0.86 on December 18), the government noted on Wednesday. “However, this decrease and the low number of new cases reported in recent days should be viewed with great caution. They can be explained to a considerable extent by the decrease in tests carried out during the holidays and the delay in reporting new cases, hospitalisations and deaths,” it said. On Tuesday the president of the government’s Covid-19 scientific taskforce called for an immediate reduction in the “sad” number of cases and for widespread testing of the population. Following the appearance of new fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus in the UK and South Africa, the government took measures on December 21 to prevent or slow down their spread in Switzerland. “To date, seven people infected with this new variant have been identified thanks to the intensified sequencing of positive tests,” it said. The government said the measures decided on December 18 were therefore all the more important to limit the number of new cases and slow the spread of these new variants. However, “if these new variants continue to spread, further measures cannot be ruled out”. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 447,905 people have tested positive for the virus and 7,005 have died in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.5 million.
2020-12-30;Economic outlook for Switzerland in 2021;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economic-outlook-for-switzerland-in-2021/46240266;Lockdown, home office, travel bans. The pandemic has shaken up the economy, but its disruptive power is having a selective effect. While the pharmaceutical industry is sailing through the crisis unscathed, the watch industry is being hit harder than any time since the last world war. What is the future of Switzerland as a location for business, work and research?  Traditionally, the Swiss economic year would start with a bang in January, with the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos. Last year, the WEF was still in the global spotlight with, among other things, the visit of US President Donald Trump. Not so in 2021: the WEF has decided to hold its annual congress – on its 50th anniversary, no less – in Singapore this year. This means that the Swiss economy will lose millions of francs, but not only that. The symbolic effect of this world event being relocated to Singapore reflects the increasing competition from Asia as a business location. Singapore has become a serious rival, especially for Swiss banks. Since the fall of Swiss banking secrecy, the flow of money from Switzerland to Singapore has increased significantly. Asia in general is in a stronger position thanks to the world’s largest trade agreement in history: the new Asian free trade zone RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), which includes economic heavyweights China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. It will be interesting to see how agreements like this will affect the commodities sector, which is strongly anchored in Switzerland. The outlook for the Swiss economy over the next year is mixed, with forecasters predicting an upturn only in the second half of the year. Switzerland will be more dependent than ever on its multinational pharmaceutical companies. This fast-growing sector, which now accounts for almost half of Swiss exports in terms of value, has not only passed the coronavirus test without any problems, but has emerged even stronger. It is expected to keep growing in importance and soon exceed a 10% share of Switzerland’s gross domestic product (GDP).  Other Swiss export sectors also depend on the pharmaceutical industry to revive their businesses and keep jobs in Switzerland. All are impatiently awaiting the Swiss vaccination campaign that is starting in late December. This is particularly true of the watchmaking industry, one of the sectors most affected by the pandemic. Exports of Swiss watches plunged by almost a quarter in 2020, the biggest drop in a year since the Second World War. Although watchmakers are pleased with the upturn observed in China in recent months, they are hoping for a quick return of tourists and the reopening of boutiques in Europe and North America. Less well-known and visible than the watch industry – but much more important in terms of exports and Swiss jobs (320,000) – the machinery, equipment and metals (MEM) industry faces a very uncertain future. Ultimately, manufacturers of machine tools for the watchmaking, aerospace and automotive industries are particularly affected by the pandemic. They will probably be the last to see signs of a sustained recovery. The coronavirus pandemic has upended almost every aspect of life, including the way we buy, prepare and eat food. Swiss-based food manufacturer Nestlé reports that demand for plant-based foods – such as meat and dairy alternatives – shot up as people tried to eat healthier at home and Covid-19 outbreaks hit meat production facilities. Switzerland is home to numerous companies and start-ups that are creating plant-based foods and changing the calculus for the future of agriculture. In 2021, we’ll continue to follow these trends and what they mean for our diets and the climate. Swiss start-ups – as well as food giants like Nestlé – are also trying to find alternatives to plastic packaging, which has been shown to end up in our bodies and in the environment at alarming levels. Next year, we’ll also be keeping tabs on the latest in materials science, and how so-called “bio-inspired materials” – or materials found in nature – could offer alternatives in packaging, pesticides and other areas. Since machines can’t get sick or spread disease, the Covid-19 pandemic has also accelerated the automation of certain tasks through robots and artificial intelligence. But how do you build trust in these technologies, address their potential to overhaul the workplace as we know it, and make sure they don’t fall into the wrong hands? Switzerland, a global robotics and AI hub, is trying to find answers to these questions, and we’ll be covering those debates. When travel and opportunities to gather were limited in 2020, people in Switzerland flocked to the mountains and to nature for a socially distanced escape. And plans for big mountain infrastructure projects – like a new express cable car to one of the most-visited sites in the Alps, the Jungfraujoch – continued despite the pandemic. But how does all this human activity affect the delicate – and crucial – biodiversity found in Europe’s largest mountain range? And will Switzerland’s many glaciers, for which it’s known as the continent’s “water tower”, still be there in 50 years, let alone 20? Our ongoing coverage of these issues will look at the reality of the situation, as well as the politics and innovations trying to address it. And high above the Alps, far from the worries of this world, lie other worlds waiting to be explored. Next year, the three-year mission of the Swiss-led CHEOPS satellite project will come to an end, and we’ll be continuing to follow its findings, as well as other milestones in space exploration involving Swiss research and engineering. CHEOPS was tasked with studying 100 of the more than 4,000 exoplanets that have been discovered since Switzerland’s Nobel Prize winners Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz found the first such planet orbiting a star other than our sun. Is there another Earth out there? We might know more next year.   In the long term, however, the pandemic should also have some positive effects on the Swiss economy. By global standards, Switzerland was considered rather backwards in terms of digitalisation and telecommuting. Many companies in the important service sector were forced to take a step forward in 2020, which should make them more competitive in the long term. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding working from home, for example regarding legal issues and data security.   
2020-12-29;Political outlook for Switzerland in 2021 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/political-outlook-for-switzerland-in-2021-/46240062;"Switzerland will have a lot to contend with in 2021 even if the country manages to emerge relatively unscathed from the coronavirus crisis. From the possible collapse of the framework agreement with the European Union and a heated domestic debate on a burka ban to the fate of the Geneva-based WTO and WHO, there are stormy waters ahead. The year 2020 ended with an epic battle at the ballot box when the responsible business initiative was rejected in a very tight race, and the tension looks set to continue into the new year. Next year’s first popular vote on a nationwide ban on wearing a burka or niqab in public places promises an equally emotional, or maybe even more emotional campaign. If accepted on 7 March 2021, this proposal which was put forward by members of hard right-wing parties in 2017, will undoubtedly make headlines in the international press.  The Egerkingen Committee, which was also the driver for the anti-minaret initiative approved by 57.5% of the Swiss voters in 2009, can count on support that goes beyond traditional conservative and nationalist circles. In French-speaking Switzerland, for example, leading politicians of all parties have established a committee together that advocates for equal rights for men and women and warns of emerging Islamic fundamentalism in Switzerland. In view of the committee’s strong arguments, it will be difficult for the government, the majority of parliamentarians and human rights organisations, which deem this initiative useless and counterproductive for women, to make their case heard. This is especially true since the burka ban has gained popularity in recent years. In Europe, France, Belgium, Denmark and Austria have already introduced a burka ban as have the Swiss cantons of Ticino and St Gallen. It is the height of irony that the initiative to ban full face coverings is put to the people at a time when everyone has been wearing a mask in public places since last summer. It remains to be seen whether the Covid-19 pandemic will have any influence on the outcome of the vote. Could 2021 become the super year of people’s initiatives? While such votes usually have little chance of succeeding (only one in ten is accepted), two other proposals requiring a constitutional amendment are coming at an opportune moment. Both are about synthetic pesticides, an issue which is close to consumers’ hearts in Switzerland and elsewhere in the world. The initiative for a Switzerland free of synthetic pesticides seeks to ban pesticide use and the import of food containing pesticides, while the clean drinking water and healthy food initiative aims to cut direct subsidies to farmers who use pesticides or antibiotics. Despite the radical nature of these proposals, it is rather unlikely that the relentless campaign by agriculture representatives and the agrochemical industry will suffice to counteract the public support they have been enjoying. History shows that the Swiss are particularly fussy when it comes to the food that ends up on their plates. In 2005, Switzerland became the first country to ban the use of genetically modified organisms. The year 2021 will also be a busy one for parliamentarians. The reform of the occupational pension scheme is at the top of their to-do list. After the Swiss people rejected the first revision of the pension reform in 2019, the ball is back in the government’s court to revise the old-age pension and disability benefit, proposing an increase in the retirement age for women from 64 to 65 years. The Covid-19 vaccine doses have been ordered, and there will be enough for everyone in Switzerland. When the time comes, people will not have to fight for a jab – not here in our wealthy country where people were willing to pay virtually any price for a mask when they were in short supply at the beginning of the pandemic. Switzerland purchased FFP2 masks worth CHF2 a piece for CHF10 which shows how desperate the nation was. Two teenage entrepreneurs who imported masks from China became multi-millionaires overnight and reportedly rewarded themselves with luxury cars. After nearly a year of fighting Covid-19, the Swiss have learnt their lesson. There is yet another debate about cost that will not go away that easily. It is about the price of life and health. How many billions should the country spend on health, or more specifically on the health of the older, more vulnerable generation? Just before Christmas, the Zurich medical historian Flurin Condrau voiced his concern that the idea of eugenics, the doctrine that divides life into worthy and unworthy, was bubbling to the surface in Switzerland. “It seems acceptable to lose a higher number of people in the age group of 65 and older just to prevent a nationwide hard lockdown,” he was quoted as saying.   Given the high number of deaths in Switzerland, his concern is understandable, but this is only one side of the story. The other side is that young people have pulled themselves together and shown humility and solidarity. They may have been forced and they may have been grumpy about it, but on the whole, they have been disciplined. It will also be the young generation who has to bear the brunt of the consequences of the virus, just like they are bearing the brunt of climate change without having greatly contributed to the damage. Expensive times are ahead of us, and despite the danger of playing the blame game, there is hope that we will remember what the pandemic has taught us: to work together, with everyone, for everyone. The Swiss public is also waiting for parliament’s position on the revision of the occupational pension scheme (the so-called second pillar) which will put interior minister Alain Berset’s popularity to the test. He has been omnipresent on the pandemic front in recent months. Having to deal with all the points above and more, will spice up this year’s four parliamentary sessions that will continue to take place in a plexiglas maze until the coronavirus is defeated. After having been on hold for two years, the debate about the framework agreement with the EU, the Gordian knot of Swiss foreign policy, has been brought back to the table. By rejecting the right-wing Swiss People’s Party’s limitation initiative in September 2020, the Swiss people paved the way for the continuation of this bilateral treaty. In October 2020, the Federal Council decided to replace the chief negotiator for EU talks Roberto Balzaretti with the previous ambassador to France, Livia Leu. This move was obviously an attempt to breathe new life into the negotiations with the EU. The upbeat mood is more on the Swiss side; the position of the EU trade negotiator is currently vacant. For years, wage protection, state aid, the EU citizenship directive and the establishment of an arbitration authority have been the sticking points between the two parties and have stalled negotiations. The list of unsuccessful negotiators reads like a Who’s Who of Swiss diplomacy: top diplomats like Yves Rossier, Jacques de Watteville and Pascale Baeriswyl all failed to make progress against the EU’s hard-line stance. In the Brexit negotiations, the EU has also made clear that its willingness for compromises has its limits. The situation remains complex, as without substantial amendments, the current draft has little chance of gaining acceptance on the domestic political front in Switzerland.   The EU’s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, which has been blocked within the EU, will have indirect consequences for Switzerland. During their last meeting in December 2020, the member states could not agree on controversial issues such as the distribution of asylum-seekers within the EU, which is heavily opposed by Poland and Hungary. Migration looks likely to become a hot European topic in 2021. Once the Covid-19 pandemic is resolved, the summer will see a significant increase in migration, the consequences of which are still unforeseeable. The pandemic has strengthened the notion of nationhood and reinstated border controls within the EU. It is likely that the southern European countries most affected by migration will try to maintain extended border protection which could lead to chaos and humanitarian disasters like the one on the Greek island of Lesbos. Migration will also shape Swiss foreign policy away from the headlines. With the new international cooperation strategy for 2021 to 2024, development cooperation will focus on four geographic regions instead of six. Operations in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe will be maintained while cooperation work in Latin America and the Caribbean will gradually be phased out by 2024. Switzerland will also fulfill its long-standing tradition of being a peace promoter and humanitarian actor as stipulated in its 2020-2023 Foreign Policy Strategy. The candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council will also move ahead in 2021.  Last but not least, Switzerland will reposition itself vis-à-vis the two global superpowers, the US and China. Under President-elect Joe Biden, US foreign policy will change course, with consequences for the country’s Middle East policy where Switzerland has been heavily involved. The federal government will also have to explain the Swiss National Bank’s interventions on the US exchange market in order to avoid economic sanctions. However, Switzerland deems this interference necessary to prevent the further appreciation of the Swiss franc and an increase in export prices. The new China strategy of the federal government requires skill and tact. Foreign minister Ignazio Cassis expressed some criticism towards China in the summer which earned him opprobrium from the business associations. So far, Switzerland has nurtured its business relations with China and has held a non-committal human rights dialogue, dismissed as a fig leaf by the left. It will be interesting to see if the Federal Council will show more courage in the new year. Most recently, it decided not to extend a controversial repatriation agreement with China which got rid of some domestic political pressure. 2021 should see some decisive changes for International Geneva, especially for some of its beleaguered organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Geopolitical tensions, especially with the US and China, will continue to affect Geneva’s role as a hub for international peace promotion, migration and humanitarian action. Funding for Geneva-based UN agencies and non-governmental organisations will be a central concern, while the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and how it has changed the way International Geneva works will gradually become more apparent. Many of the cash-strapped organisations in Geneva are hopeful that the new US administration will support them again and put an end to the pressure they experienced under the Trump administration. However, it is unlikely that everything will change overnight once Joe Biden enters the White House. Organisations like the WTO will still be under immense pressure to push through reforms. Will the WTO be able to survive without an efficient system of mediation and arbitration to settle trade disputes? How will China and developing countries engage with the WTO? At the beginning of the year, the WTO will appoint a new leader, and for the first time in the 25-year history of the organisation it will be a woman. After President Trump accused the WHO of being too lax with China during the Covid-19 pandemic, the organisation is now pushing ahead with its COVAX pool of vaccines which aims to ensure developing countries’ equitable access to the inoculation. Once the first vaccines are rolled out, it will be interesting to see if COVAX will restore the WHO’s image. There are also plans for a global WHO-led system for sharing pathogen materials and clinical samples to “facilitate the rapid development of medical countermeasures as global public goods”, said WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus. Digitalisation will also be high up on the agenda in 2021. Remote working and e-diplomacy which were introduced during the pandemic have not been without hiccups, but for many employers they carry huge cost-saving potential. How will Geneva-based organisations deal with this in 2021? International Geneva will also try to establish itself as a hub for digital policymaking, digital ethics, data management and cyber security. It will be interesting to see whether it succeeds."
2020-12-28;2020 – a lonely but lively year for Swiss cartoonists;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/2020---a-lonely-but-golden-year-for-swiss-cartoonists/46239556;How did life change for political cartoonists in 2020? On the one (cramped) hand, not much for a generally solitary, work-from-home occupation. On the other, there was so much news – mostly grim – that they were never in danger of running out of material to satirise. Although Covid-19 was first detected in China last year, it took a few weeks to hit Western radars. SWI swissinfo.ch’s first article appeared on January 22 – and the issue has dominated our multimedia coverage ever since. Swiss cartoonists and caricaturists also quickly rose to the challenge of coronavirus, which turned out to be an ideal subject. There was the perceived incompetence of figures of authority, popular confusion and anger over masks and later vaccinations, and the humorous potential of enforced changes in social behaviour, such as quarantine. It helped that strong visual symbols existed in facemasks and syringes. Artists took different approaches to Covid-19 – and indeed other major topics, notably Donald Trump. While some used highbrow cultural references or (less common in Switzerland) barbed criticism to almost shock readers, others aimed for the laughs, lowering people’s guard for the emotional punch.
2020-12-28;Hundreds of British tourists flee Swiss quarantine ‘under cover of night’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hundreds-of-british-tourists-flee-swiss-quarantine--under-cover-of-night-/46249060;Hundreds of “furious” tourists from the UK have absconded from obligatory quarantine in the Swiss resort of Verbier. They face fines of up to CHF10,000 ($11,280). “Hoteliers noticed that breakfast trays placed outside room doors had not been touched and then realised that the guests had left,” said Jean-Marc Sandoz, spokesman for the municipality of Bagnes, to which Verbier belongs. He said the resort had identified 420 guests from Britain, including Swiss nationals living there, who had to be quarantined before Christmas. About 50 left immediately and of the remaining 370, fewer than a dozen were still there on Sunday. Many remained in quarantine for a day before fleeing under cover of night, he said. “We understand their anger,” Sandoz said. He sharply criticised the sudden quarantine requirement for arrivals from Britain. Municipalities had received no help to implement the regulations, he said. Simon Wiget, director of Verbier tourism, told Reuters that the sudden quarantine order had placed local authorities in a difficult situation. “It’s our role to pass on information – we're not the police,” he said. On December 20 Switzerland halted all flights from Britain and South Africa because a new variant of the coronavirus, thought to be more infectious, had been detected in those countries. The Swiss authorities ordered all arrivals since December 14 to be quarantined retroactively for ten days from the date of arrival. “There were families with small children suddenly stuck in 20 square metres,” Sandoz said. “It was unbearable.” He said some guests had since got in touch from neighbouring France, where the ski resorts were closed “but the Brits could at least get some fresh air”. Sandoz said the local authorities in Switzerland had initially tried to find return flights for the guests, but when it became clear that only those who had completed ten days of quarantine would be allowed on board, “those affected dismissed the idea”. According to the authorities, there have been 92 flights from the UK since December 14 with an estimated 10,000 people on board. Sandoz believes that many of these were returning Swiss nationals who were not to be found in ski resorts. Asked about the run-away tourists, Health Minister Alain Berset said: “We are aware of that. It’s obviously a problem. There was an order to quarantine that has not been respected.” He said he didn't know the current whereabouts of the tourists but suspected that they had gone home. “One shouldn’t underestimate what an impossible situation it was,” he said. “We had to decide within hours what to do ... That things don’t work perfectly in such a situation, that problems surface is a reality we have to live with.” For Verbier, which has a population of around 9,000, it was one of the blackest weeks on record. Because around a fifth of guests there traditionally come from the UK, the resort suddenly gained a reputation as a Covid hotspot. “Many Swiss people then cancelled their holidays,” Sandoz said. “Normally Verbier has 50,000 guests that week. Now the hotels only have an occupancy rate of 30-40%.” Sandoz also fears that the atmosphere has been poisoned for the future. His own British-born neighbour has been criticised in public because of her accent, despite living in Switzerland for 40 years, he said. “Guests from Britain were understandably furious, accosting hoteliers and complaining to the tourism board,” he said. “We don’t know if they’ll ever return.”
2020-12-28;Shattered dreams – a Swiss emigrant returns home;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/shattered-dreams---a-swiss-emigrant-returns-home/46239402;The coronavirus pandemic has hit many Swiss emigrants hard. An increasing number feel compelled to return to Switzerland. Lotti Pfyl is among them. “This is the lowest financial point of my life,” says 60-year-old Lotti Pfyl. She has made up her mind. She is giving up her life as a Swiss woman abroad. She is returning home from Germany in February 2021. “I had to admit to myself in the last months that I haven’t made it work.” In the past five years, an average of around 25,000 Swiss returned from abroad annually, according to the Federal Statistical Office. For 2020, there are no figures yet. The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) reported in May that its offices abroad, its helpline and the Basel Office of Economy and Labour had received an increasing number of requests from Swiss emigrants who wanted to return home. Most Swiss abroad come back without the consulate’s help, as will be the case for Lotti Pfyl. Her original idea was to set up an independent life in Nordfriesland in northern Germany. She had spent her holidays there over many years and built up a circle of acquaintances and made friends. She originally planned to emigrate after her retirement. She thought that the relatively small private pension she would manage to save by then, together with her state pension, would go much further there that it would in Switzerland. Pfyl divorced before the year 2000, and at that time pensions were not divided between spouses. But a burnout prompted her to reconsider, and she left Switzerland ten years before retirement. A mother of two adult children, she cashed in her pension and bought a big house with holiday apartments in Nordfriesland. She began renovating and let the apartments. She also earned a little extra money on the side by sewing. But after four years on the island, she had to give up her project. “It was too much to cope with alone.” She managed to sell the property within three months and, after a stop on the way in Husum, she went south to Upper Palatinate in Bavaria, where she found a job. Pfyl is a trained ventilation draughtswoman and has a federal qualification as an accountant. She is also a trained seamstress. In February 2020, she applied, fully motivated, for a job with a leading manufacturer of sewing machines. Then the coronavirus hit and all her hopes were once again dashed to the ground. “My employer had no more work for me,” she says. But Pfyl remained positive and applied, for instance, for a job as a contact tracer in Bavaria. But since the interview in the summer, she says she hasn’t heard anything. The second wave of the pandemic in the autumn brought doubts with it. She had no income, and because of social distancing, it was almost impossible to get to know people in her new home. “And that won’t change for the foreseeable future,” she says. Thoughts of returning came gradually – and then became firm plans. Friends and family in Switzerland said many times on the phone: “Then just come home.” Pfyl began to do some research. “What must I take into account on returning, and what conditions have to be in place? Where would I get support?” She contacted the Swiss consulate and began to look for a job and an apartment in Switzerland. It was a difficult undertaking. “Hardly anyone wants to invest in me at the age of 60,” Pfyl says. But she quickly found out that she would get help if she came back. That eased her mind. What frightened her was the information she got from the consulate. “The consulate will only help if you have sold everything that you own and only take back what fits in a car. That is absurd.” “I at least need furniture and my computer for job applications,” she says. “It would cost far more to buy everything again in Switzerland.” As she recounts her fate on the phone, she is struggling with tears. “I have to fight my demons every day to avoid falling into an abyss, because I will be reliant on social welfare.” While the “shame” of depending on social welfare puts many Swiss abroad off returning, Pfyl is summoning her courage and taking the step. “I will do it,” she says with conviction. Even if this means that she has to give up her car in order to apply for benefits and will need to think twice about even the smallest of expenses. “My dream is shattered, and now I have to look ahead to the future.” An increasing number of Swiss are suffering the same fate as Pfyl since the outbreak of the pandemic. The Organisation of the Swiss Abroad (OSA) has observed the trend: “We have an increasing number of inquiries about returning to Switzerland. About 75% of them ask questions relating to social welfare when they return,” says spokeswoman Jézael Fritsche. To help applicants get through emergency situations and reintegrate in Switzerland, OSA also has a fund called “Kilcher.” It is modest financial aid in the form of an interest-free loan for returning Swiss emigrants. “The E.O. Kilcher fund was used in 2020 to make payments to applicants,” OSA writes. “We have also had more inquiries about it. In the meantime, Pfyl has been able to celebrate one small success. She has found an affordable apartment in Walzenhausen in the canton of Appenzell Outer-Rhodes. She will be back in February 2021. She is taking this step very seriously. “I am simply trying to organise everything as far as possible in advance,” she says. She is looking forward to seeing her family, to speaking Swiss German again, and to vermicelles – a Swiss dessert made with chestnut puree.
2020-12-27;European scientists call for continent-wide Covid approach;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/european-scientists-call-for-continent-wide-covid-approach/46247996;Several Swiss scientists have also signed the appeal calling for better European coordination to avoid pandemic efforts by some countries being undermined by others. To prevent “a ping-pong effect of importing and reimporting” Covid cases, an effort to reduce infections should be synchronised across all European countries and start as soon as possible, the researchers recommended last weekExternal link in The Lancet medical journal. Of the 350 signatories, nine were Swiss, the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper says: these include several members of the government’s scientific taskforce advisory body. Isabelle Eckerle, a Geneva virologist who added her name, said the coordinated effort had become necessary not only to bring down high infection numbers, but also to avoid the danger that unsynchronised measures in different countries end up undercutting each other. “In a Europe with open borders, the pandemic efforts are only as good as the country which manages least well,” she told the NZZ. Eckerle said a continent-wide lockdown could be used to bring down case numbers to what the scientists reckon should be a maximum of 10 new infections per day per million people. For reference, the current Swiss numbers (where the seven-day average is 4,064 new cases in a country of 8.5 million people) are about 50 times higher than this. “This target has been reached in many countries, and can be reached again throughout Europe by spring 2021, at the latest,” the scientists write. They say keeping numbers stable at a high level leads to excess mortality, difficulties in contact tracing, and strains on mental health and the economy. They cite China and Australia as examples where the economic cost of the pandemic was mitigated by strong lockdowns to reduce or eliminate the virus. The recent case of the virus mutation from the UK, which has already spread in at least several instances to Switzerland, shows just how quickly open borders can lead to sudden spreads from country to country, the NZZ writes. The UK variant, which is feared to be much more contagious and fast-spreading than the coronavirus strain it evolved from, was confirmed in three cases in Switzerland over the past days, the federal health office confirmed.
2020-12-26;Novel Covid strain also identified in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/novel-covid-strain-also-identified-in-switzerland/46246282;The first cases of patients with the new strain of coronavirus have been confirmed in Switzerland. According to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), the novel Covid-19 variant VOC-202012/01 has been identified in three samples. Two patients are resident in Britain and tested positive for Covid in Switzerland over the past few days. News of a third patient came out on Saturday. “All close contacts have been identified and quarantined,” a FOPH spokeswoman told Swiss public broadcaster SRF, confirming a report in the Sonntagszeitung newspaper on Saturday. In addition, in these “special cases” the contacts of the contacts will also be clarified “and quarantined if necessary. The work is ongoing”. The health office said it had informed the cantonal authorities, all in German-speaking Switzerland. It declined to say which cantons, exactly. New strains of coronavirus were found independently in Britain and South Africa earlier this week. The new variant is reported to have spread to several countries in Europe as well as to Australia and Singapore. Switzerland on Monday imposed an entry ban for tourists from Britain and South Africa. Flights to both countries were suspended. However, the ban was partially lifted on Thursday to allow several flights for British tourists from Zurich and Geneva as well as for Swiss residents in Britain. Further flights are scheduled in the coming days according to the Swiss news agency, Keystone-SDA. An estimated 10,000 British winter tourists arrived in Switzerland since December 14. They were ordered to go into a ten-day quarantine. The health office said it contacted passengers from Britain and South Africa via text message to inform them about the health safety regulations. The government’s advisory Covid task forceExternal link has called for increased testing and tracing efforts to detect possible cases with the new variant of coronavirus in Switzerland. The experts warned that the new strain made it more difficult to contain the pandemic, according to a statement published on Friday.
2020-12-26;‘We were too lax’ admits Swiss health minister on Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-we-were-too-lax--admits-swiss-health-minister-on-covid-19/46247082;In an interview with Swiss public television, SRF, Health Minister Alain Berset has acknowledged that Switzerland made mistakes in managing the coronavirus outbreak. “We were too lax,” Berset said, pointing out that in the summer – after the first wave – people had the feeling that the worst was over. “And then we were far too optimistic when we thought we could reopen the big events in the fall.” The worst thing, however, is to freeze and do nothing when dealing with a crisis, added Berset. And one thing is clear: “If you make mistakes, you have to correct them as quickly as possible.” The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed Berset’s own physical limits as well. As he told SRF, there were moments during the first wave when he no longer knew whether it was day or night, weekday or weekend. He said he had never experienced anything like that before. He said that people’s health had top priority, even if that required controversial measures like closing the schools for nearly two months – “probably the most difficult decision for us”. And despite the vaccine and better medicines, he believes that the virus “will not disappear so quickly”. The Swiss way – which gives the individual cantons a lot of control – has its price, added Berset. “It demands personal responsibility, common sense and foresight from everyone. If that doesn’t work, we have to tighten the measures. That’s what we’ve done,” said the health minister, adding that he was impressed by the solidarity shown in the spring. The SRF interview with BersetExternal link airs on Sunday, on SRF’s “Sternstunde Philosophie” programme. 
2020-12-25;New president says Switzerland ‘always puts the health of its population first’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-president-says-switzerland--always-puts-the-health-of-its-population-first-/46244898;"Guy Parmelin will assume the rotating Swiss presidency for the first time on January 1. He will have the difficult tasks of guiding Switzerland through the Covid-19 pandemic and defending the institutional agreement with the European Union against the wishes of his right-wing party. The 61-year-old economics minister spoke to SWI swissinfo.ch during a ten-day quarantine, which he was forced to enter after returning from London on December 14. swissinfo.ch: In recent months economic interests have played a major role in Switzerland’s policy against Covid-19. The magazine Foreign Policy, for example, ran the headline ‘Switzerland is choosing austerity over life’. Did Switzerland choose austerity over life? Guy Parmelin: No, I’m opposed to this view, which presents Switzerland as a selfish country in its handling of the coronavirus crisis. We have always put the health of the population first. That said, balancing health measures and their economic effects is obviously necessary. So far, we’ve managed to do that pretty well. We regularly review our system. In recent weeks the cantons have begun to coordinate better and to apply stricter measures than the national standards allow. This demonstrates the responsibility they have taken in managing this crisis. swissinfo.ch: But in Austria and Germany, two neighbouring countries with comparable health systems, relative mortality rates are much lower. How do you explain this? G.P.: Each country is dealing with the crisis in its own way. Germany, which is a federalist country comparable to ours, was less affected at the beginning of the crisis this spring. Austria acted very firmly at the beginning, then opted for liberal measures in the summer before tightening them again. Switzerland is constantly carrying out its own analysis of the situation. One can always criticise the government’s decisions and feel that it should have acted differently. But we are taking responsibility for our choices, which were made in coordination with the cantons. We have clear rules and criteria – that’s how things work here. swissinfo.ch: This autumn a lot of noise was made about the measures of varying sizes decided by the cantons, which caused a fair bit of irritation. Will federalism emerge unscathed from this crisis? G.P.: I’m convinced that it’s not a question of a failure of federalism, even if it’s necessary to have a look certain aspects of it. Federalism must work not only in good weather but also in a storm. There have sometimes been delays and poor coordination between the various levels of the state. Lessons must be learnt. But it’s not true that methods used in centralised countries have been better than ours. We are all committed to federalism and national cohesion; we’re not going to throw them away at the first crisis that comes along. swissinfo.ch: Confidence in the government is at an all-time low, according to polls. How do you intend to win back the hearts of the Swiss? G.P.: What is really difficult in this crisis is to enable people and businesses to plan for the future. This leads to growing dissatisfaction with our decisions – which I completely understand. I also sense a certain fatigue among the population. The arrival of the vaccines should help relax the atmosphere and gradually return things to normal. But let’s be clear: the damage has been done; it will be long-term. Our role will be to minimise it and ensure that Switzerland is ready when the recovery comes. swissinfo.ch: The crisis has already cost the government more than CHF30 billion ($33.7 billion). But at just under 30% of GDP Switzerland’s debt ratio is still very low by international standards. Isn’t it time for the state to play a greater role and develop an investment plan to revive the economy? G.P.: Economists are almost unanimous: a stimulus package would not make sense at the moment. The financial stimuli and the billions of francs that have been freed up allow the economic machine to continue to function and to withstand temporary difficulties. At the same time, we are investing heavily in the future. Parliament decided in its last session to grant a credit of CHF28 billion for research and education over the next four years. Measures were also decided to support the export industry and SMEs [small and medium-sized businesses] that want to invest in research and development projects. The government has set up a special innovation promotion programme worth CHF130 million for the next two years. This means that up to 2024 a total of CHF260 million will be made available to encourage companies to invest in innovation by relieving them of part of their costs. Tourism, sport and the cultural sector will also benefit from other specific types of support. swissinfo.ch: Is the Swiss economy resilient enough to recover quickly from the crisis or is it likely to suffer serious damage? G.P.: The damage has been done. It varies greatly from one economic sector to another. Within a single industry, the situation is very uneven. For example, hotels in cities are suffering much more than those in the mountains. However, the latest statistics show that the bankruptcy rate in 2020 was lower than in previous years. This proves that the state has intervened in a targeted and effective manner, even if it may be keeping economic structures alive artificially. The way out of the crisis will depend on the rate at which we can vaccinate the population and regain control of the epidemic. I believe that the best recovery plan is one that allows people to work. swissinfo.ch: You place a lot of hope in vaccinating the population. However, compared internationally, the Swiss are particularly sceptical about the Covid vaccine. Are you going to get vaccinated in public to set an example? G.P.: Of course I’m going to get vaccinated, and I’m prepared to do it in the middle of a football stadium if necessary (laughs). Vaccination is a civic act towards people at risk and it is the best way to quickly return to a certain normality. That said, the fears and questions of part of the population are perfectly legitimate. The Swiss authorities will demonstrate maximum transparency over the coming months, both on the composition and effectiveness of this vaccine and on its possible side effects.   swissinfo.ch: As president, you will also be expected to report on the institutional framework agreement with the EU – if this is successful. Are you ready to put your signature at the bottom of this document in Brussels? G.P.: Before signing this agreement, the negotiations and discussions currently underway must be completed. The government will take note of this and then decide on the way forward. If there is the outcome you mention, the Swiss president should in principle initial the document. swissinfo.ch: You will then be completely at odds with your party, the Swiss People’s Party, which steadfastly rejects this agreement. G.P.: Every cabinet minister represents the views of a political party. But then discussions take place, decisions are taken and they are supported by the entire government. This is called collegiality. In this particular case, it will be no different. When you are elected to the government, you know the rules of the game. If you don’t want to stick to them, you shouldn’t run for election. Translated from French by Thomas Stephens"
2020-12-24;Avalanches: looming danger in the Swiss Alps;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/avalanches--looming-danger-in-the-swiss-alps/46238222;"Switzerland has a long tradition of avalanche safety and was the first country to publish a bulletin on avalanches twice a day. But how predictable are avalanches really? Since the 19th century, the Swiss Alps have been attracting tourists from around the world. With the Christmas holidays coming, operators of facilities are getting ready to deal with a winter season that will be different from usual. Due to the pandemic, foreign tourists are scarce, and the ski resorts are having to adopt severe precautions to prevent spread of the coronavirus. This is an exceptional situation, but it does not take away from the fact that one of the main natural hazards encountered in the Swiss Alps is avalanches. Heavy snowfalls, rain, wind, variations in temperature and the slope of the terrain all affect the stability of the snow cover. If something upsets the balance, the mass of snow begins to slide downwards, leading to an avalanche. Even the weight of a single skier can be enough to launch one. As a result of global warming, more snow is expected beyond the snow line in mountain regions. There will accordingly be an increase in the occurrence of avalanches, warns the Swiss national platform “natural hazards”. >> The following video shows pictures of avalanches that fell in Switzerland during an exceptional period in January 2018: According to the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) in Davos, the first centralised group dedicated to the systematic study of  avalanches in Switzerland was founded in 1931 at the urging of winter tourism representatives, transportation companies and  hydro-electric power stations. In 1940 the Swiss army started the first early warning system for avalanches, with observation posts in various parts of the country. There was a definite reason for the involvement of the military; a year before, an avalanche above Lenk, in Canton Bern, had swept away an entire company of soldiers. In 1945, at the end of the Second World War, the avalanche control system was transferred into civilian hands, more precisely to the newly-created Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos. In 2018, risk management for avalanches by Switzerland and Austria was added to the UNESCO intangible world cultural heritage listExternal link. “At present we are not able to predict in any great detail where and when an avalanche is going to start off. We can only specify the intervals of time within which avalanches may occur in a given region,” Thomas Stucki, head of the avalanche control team at SLF, told SWI swissinfo.ch. Since its foundation, the institute has been issuing an avalanche bulletin. In the past, this was disseminated via radio and newspapers once a week, but the bulletin – which marked its 75th anniversary on December 21 – now comes out twice a day throughout the winter. The information is also available on smartphones. It covers the whole of the Swiss Alps, Liechtenstein and the Jura. “Our avalanche bulletin is similar to the ones in other Alpine countries. But for a long time, Switzerland was the only country to issue one twice a day,” points out Stucki, who is also coordinator of the Europe-wide EAWS early warning system for avalanches. In Switzerland, 500 kilometres of protective structures – such as metal snow fences – have been built, and extensive belts of woodland protect villages, infrastructure and communications. The Alps are actually more populated than other mountain regions. The warning system for avalanches, as well as having 193 automatic measurement posts, relies on a whole network of human observers. About 200 trained people check the presence of fresh snow and collect data throughout Switzerland, and then send this information to the central office. “There are networks of observers in other countries too, but the density of our network and its level of training and skill are unique,” Gian Darms, an expert at the institute in Davos, told SWI swissinfo.ch in 2018. Data from the observers are analysed by the institute’s staff, who put together the avalanche bulletin using computer modelling of weather conditions and snow cover. To identify the degree of danger in a region, they use a European scale divided into five levels. This tool is probably “the most significant result of European collaboration,” says Stucki. Since 1936, about 2,000 people have died in avalanches in Switzerland. There have been an average of 100 reported avalanches a year where people were involved. On average, 24 people die in avalanches every year,  In the last 20 years, more than 90% of the fatalities occurred off-piste. The number of fatalities was particularly high in cantons Valais and Graubünden. The chart shows that notwithstanding prevention strategies, the number of fatalities caused by avalanches has not gone down. Why is this so? “These days there are more people up in the mountains. As well, people ski not just around the new year but throughout the winter,” Stucki points out. “We can say that thanks to prevention strategies, the number of fatalities has remained stable despite there being more people out there.” In most avalanche accidents, says the institute, the avalanche is caused by the victims or at least members of their group. According to Stucki, it is therefore crucial to get training to be able to judge the avalanche risk for yourself. Apart from careful preparation and adequate equipment, he stresses the importance of not going out alone. Translated from Italian by Terence Macnamee"
2020-12-24;Old people in Switzerland urged to get Covid jab;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/old-people-in-switzerland-urged-to-get-covid-jab/46244994;The Swiss Senior Citizens’ Council has appealed to all elderly citizens to get vaccinated, saying this would be an effective contribution to combating the pandemic and the associated health and economic crisis. The Seniors’ Council was very relieved to learn of the launch of the vaccination campaign against Covid-19, it said in a statement on Thursday. It said it supported the Federal Council and the Federal Office of Public Health in their efforts to combat the pandemic. On Wednesday a 90-year-old woman became the first person in Switzerland to be vaccinated against Covid-19. The landmark jab marks the start of a vaccination programme that will be rolled out across the country in the coming weeks. “Older people have paid a very high price for the pandemic in terms of deaths and hospitalisations. They are by far the segment of the population most at risk of contracting a severe form of Covid-19,” it said. Of the almost 6,500 coronavirus deaths in Switzerland so far, almost three-quarters have involved people over the age of 80.
2020-12-24;Covid: Sense of loss of control exacerbated mental illnesses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus--sense-of-loss-of-control-exacerbated-mental-illnesses/46244568;Two-thirds of mentally ill women and half of mentally ill men reported worsening symptoms during the first wave of Covid-19, according to a global study with the participation of the University of Zurich. The feeling of loss of control during the pandemic was a particular burden for the patients. They were also badly affected by the lack of social interaction and dissatisfaction with the government’s coronavirus measures, wrote researchers in the journal Frontiers in PsychiatryExternal link. In spring an international team led by Ali Jawaid, who worked at the University of Zurich and now conducts research at the Polish Braincity Institute, conducted an online survey of 2,734 patients with existing mental illnesses from 12 countries. In Switzerland half of the study participants reported worsening symptoms. Canada had the highest number of respondents at 80%, followed by Pakistan (72%) and the United States (68%). Turkey had the lowest proportion among the countries studied, at 29%. The researchers also identified behaviours that had a positive clinical impact. These include talking about one’s worries with people to whom one is close, having a realistic view of the pandemic, and using social media “moderately”.
2020-12-24;Swiss airline start-up vows to take-off despite pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-airline-start-up-views-covid-19-as-opportunity/46238248;While most airlines are wondering how they will survive coronavirus, one Swiss start-up believes the pandemic could help it finally get into the air. Swiss Skies has rebranded itself as Moov Airways and is determined to create a new long-haul, budget carrier operating out of Basel airport. The Swiss Skies project launched to much fanfare in 2018. But a year later it looked to have permanently stalled after failing to persuade investors to inject CHF100 million ($113 million) of starting capital. Two founding members abandoned the venture to take on jobs elsewhere. The timing of the budding airline’s relaunch is curious, to say the least. The pandemic has devastated the airline industry, putting many carriers in peril of demise and forcing others to go cap in hand to governments for bail-out cash. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has forecast losses of $118 billion for the industry this year. Swiss International Air Lines reckons on 1,000 job losses over the next two years, despite a CHF1.5 billion government loan. But Moov founder and CEO Alvaro Oliveira sees a silver lining to the gloom afflicting the industry. “This creates an opportunity for new entrants,” he told swissinfo.ch. “Established airlines are reducing fleets, making it cheaper to lease aircraft. More slots will be available at airports than in the past. And there are lots of experienced people losing their jobs, looking for new opportunities.” “The ability of the competition to react to our arrival will be impaired,” he added. “The legacy businesses are facing overwhelming levels of debt looking ahead.” The ambitious strategic targets of Swiss Skies, to run dozens of aircraft and to employ thousands of staff, have been taken over by Moov. But Oliveira, who was born and raised in Brazil and used to fly commercial aircraft, recognises that the effects of the pandemic, particularly on business traffic, may force the company to alter its plans to some extent. The model of using second-tier airports around Europe, such as Basel, broadly follows that of short-haul budget airlines. Moov plans to fly direct, non-stop to the eastern seaboard of the United States (including New York), Canada, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and possibly India. The company is targeting the Airbus 321 LXR (extra-long range) as its aircraft of choice, which should start rolling off the production lines in 2023. Moov has recently added a new ambition – to take over the running of Lugano airport in Switzerland, near to the Italian border. It is competing with six other consortiums to manage an airport that has struggled to compete with nearly Milan and Zurich for passengers. A short-list of candidates is expected to be decided in mid-January. The elephant in the room is finding the CHF100 million to get Moov off the ground. Deep-pocketed investors proved hard to find during the booming growth years of air transport. “We cannot expect a high level of risk appetite from traditional investors for a new airline,” admits Oliveira. So Moov has turned to a new form of capital-raising that leverages distributed ledger technology (DLT), which is similar to blockchain. This fledgling technique of creating and trading digital versions of company shares promises to reduce costs and increase access to a wider range of investors. Moov had considered this fund-raising exercise two years ago, having witnessed other start-ups accumulate huge sums – even hundreds of millions of dollars. But the company decided to postpone its so-called “security token offering” (STO) until regulators introduced greater legal certainty. It remains to be seen whether the general public will have a greater appetite for investing in a new airline than private equity players – although Moov has not given up entirely on attracting institutional investors.
2020-12-24;Stranded Brits and South Africans begin to return home for Christmas;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/stranded-brits-and-south-africans-to-return-home-for-christmas/46243184;Residents of Britain or South Africa currently in Switzerland will be able to return home from Thursday, subject to conditions. Flights between the countries were stopped on Sunday after reports of a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain. The same goes for Swiss residents stuck in the UK or South Africa, the government said in a statementExternal link on Wednesday. The objective is to allow people to return to their homes over Christmas. Two planes from Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) left Zurich for Heathrow on Thursday morning. One more is set to take off from Zurich on Friday and two on Saturday. One plane will also leave for Britain from Geneva Airport. The existing protective measures and quarantine rules apply, and passengers in quarantine are subject to special protective measures. “They will be kept apart from other travellers on the journey to the airport to minimise the epidemiological risk,” the government said. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) will work with the cantons to coordinate this special transfer service. Airlines will be required to comply with existing protective health measures when operating these flights. For flights departing from the UK and South Africa and arriving in Switzerland, the airlines must seek prior approval from the Federal Office of Civil Aviation in view of the high risk of passengers introducing the new variant to Switzerland. Only the following categories of people may travel as passengers:• Swiss citizens (including citizens of Liechtenstein)• Holders of a Swiss residence permit or type D visa from Switzerland• Holders of a “laisser passer” issued by a Swiss representation in hardship cases Airlines will be required to inform their passengers, for example with an in-flight announcement, that they must comply with Swiss quarantine rules on arrival.
2020-12-21;Swiss impose entry ban for travellers from UK and South Africa;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-impose-entry-ban-for-travellers-from-uk-and-south-africa/46237718;The Swiss government has ordered people who entered the country from the United Kingdom and South Africa since December 14 to go into a ten-day quarantine and imposed a general entry ban for foreign nationals seeking to travel from the two countries. The steps were taken to prevent the further spread of the new virus strain and to “stop travel from these countries for tourism purposes”, the government said in a statementExternal link on Monday. Flights between Switzerland and the UK and South Africa were suspended from midnight on December 20 following reports of the emergence of a new fast-spreading variant of coronavirus in southeast England. An estimated 10,000 British holidaymakers had arrived in Switzerland since December 14, but they would not necessarily have to start a ten-day quarantine from Monday, explained Patrick Mathys, head of crisis management at the Federal Office of Public Health. If they feel healthy, they can leave quarantine ten days after their arrival. So someone who arrived in Switzerland seven days ago – and who is not showing any symptoms – must only stay in their hotel or home for another three days. Speaking at a news conference, Mathys said 92 flights from the UK and four flights from South Africa in the period since December 14 were affected. The government was now collecting the airlines’ passenger data which would be made available to the cantons, he said. The cantons would then have to control the quarantine. Swiss Economics Minister Guy Parmelin (who will become the country's new president in 2021) was one of those affected by the new quarantine requirement. He will remain in quarantine until Thursday as he returned from London on December 14 where he was on official business. The Swiss government said it was considering a “temporary derogation from the flight ban” for persons resident in Britain or South Africa currently staying in Switzerland so that they may return home. “That is also the case for persons resident in Switzerland currently staying in those two countries,” it added. The foreign ministry called on Swiss citizens in the UK and South Africa to register their trips and stays on the mobile phone app “Travel Admin”External link. This would enable them to be contacted for a possible return trip, said Hans-Peter Lenz, head of the ministry’s crisis management centre. However, he said there would not be a repatriation campaign as in spring. The costs for the flights will therefore not be paid by the state according to Lenz. It's not clear how many expat Swiss citizens are interested in returning to Switzerland, but the government hopes to have a first overview within the next two days. Some 37,500 Swiss live in Britain and just under 8,500 live in South Africa. Most of them have dual nationality. Explaining the entry ban, the government said it had decided to “withdraw freedom of movement privileges from persons resident in the UK until December 31. Persons from the UK are therefore subject to a general ban on entering Switzerland. Freedom of movement privileges for British citizens were due to expire at the end of the year anyway.” There is no official indication how long the Swiss entry ban will remain in place. Following the end of the post-Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, British nationals will officially qualify as third country nationals. If there were no coronavirus pandemic, from January 1 British citizens would normally be allowed to enter Switzerland as third country nationals with a valid six-month passport and stay in Switzerland and the Schengen area for a maximum total of 90 days over a 180 day period.  The Swiss authorities say that so far no cases of the new Covid-19 strain have been identified in Switzerland. The government’s Covid task force considers the new variant of the coronavirus to be “highly problematic”. Switzerland is in a risk zone with a health system at the limit of its capacity, it said on Sunday. It pointed out that there are also seasonal factors such as increased mobility during the holiday season, winter sports and greater time spent indoors. Other countries, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Israel and Canada have shut off travel ties after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that a highly infectious new strain of the virus was a danger to the country. Johnson will chair an emergency response meeting on Monday to discuss international travel, in particular the flow of freight in and out of Britain. EU officials are due to hold a meeting on Monday on coordinating their response.
2020-12-21;Counting the votes, accepting the results;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/counting-the-votes--accepting-the-results/46238594;"After weeks of tense tallying, the US Electoral College has finally confirmed the next American president. In Switzerland and elsewhere, counting takes much less time – but are the results as reliable? This and more in the latest SWI democracy briefing. Never before did so many Americans participate in an election as in 2020 – more than 155 million cast their ballot in November to elect hundreds of new officeholders and to decide on thousands of referendums. When it came to ultimately confirming the next US president, however, it was a college of 538 electors who gathered on December 14 across the 50 states which made the decision – one that will be published officially in Congress on January 6. The weeks since November 3 have been tense: the election’s big loser, incumbent Donald Trump, launched a comprehensive campaign to question the results. The last few weeks also offered a transparent perspective on a complex counting process which allows for many ways of questioning the outcome by legal means. But in the end, the Supreme Court clearly rejected all attempts to overturn the democratic will of voters. What can we learn from all this? The certification and protection of proper election and referendum results is done very differently across the world, and in many jurisdictions – including Switzerland – robust results are already available a few hours after polls close. • How election counting tames a wild democracy – and how other democracies are able to deliver results much quicker than the US, including Switzerland and Taiwan (SWI swissinfo.ch) • Switzerland also experienced a special voting day recently, when for only the second time in history the popular vote in favour of an initiative was overturned by a majority of cantons (SWI swissinfo.ch) • In the world’s biggest democracy there is no election “dayExternal link” – in India there are election weeks and a process that’s even more cumbersome than in America to identify a winner (Zocalo Public Square) Meanwhile, Covid-19 is still upending not just societies worldwide, but also democracy. The pandemic has swept through a world that was in many ways already ailing: in the past few years, more countries have experienced democratic erosion, backsliding, populist disruption and deepening autocratisation than at any time since the so-called “third wave” of democratisation in the 1970s. But despite these challenges – or perhaps because of them – democratic aspirations have remained strong. Even in the pandemic, we have seen signs of democracy’s resilience and capacity for renewal. Innovation through accelerated digitalisation, for example, has occurred across many regions of the world – though not everywhere. • In Switzerland, for example, digital signature gathering has not taken off in spite of Covid-19, while progress has been made in other parts of the world (SWI swissinfo.ch) • At the same time new initiatives and referendums have been launched to deal with the legislation and challenges connected to the coronavirus (SWI swissinfo.ch) • In a special focus on the consequences of Covid-19External link, the International IDEA group shares new data on how the pandemic has affected democracy (IDEA) One area of democratic research – and increasingly practice – that has been booming the past few years is “deliberative democracy”: a form of decision-making based on bringing citizens together around a table to discuss a certain issue, before presenting their consensus-based ideas as possible ways to make policy. It’s a fairly marginal form of democracy in a world still run by elected parliaments and powerful executives. But as popular protest and dissatisfaction spreads in many western democracies, deliberation is seen as a positive way of including more voices – and more representative voices – in decision-making. Iceland set the tone a few years ago with a new constitution largely drawn up by citizen committees; Ireland has also used such constitutional assemblies to help decide on heated issues like abortion law. France has been another high-profile example of a country turning to deliberation, with its Citizens’ Convention for Climate. • SWI swissinfo.ch recently interviewed Hélène Landemore, the Yale professor who is both a scholar and an advocate of deliberative methods; she recently released a book on the issue, Open Democracy (SWI swissinfo.ch) • Switzerland has a long history with the ideaExternal link of open government, as researchers from Lausanne recently explore in their book “Random Selection and Politics: a Swiss History” (EPFL, in French) • Widely hailed as a pioneer of deliberative studiesExternal link, former University of Bern professor Jürg Steiner passed away in November at the age of 86; the Neue Zürcher Zeitung writes that he “spent his life exploring the possibility of how to share power without violence (NZZ, in German) Is there anything else you’d like to hear about from the world of direct democracy? Get in touch with our correspondents Bruno KaufmannExternal link or Domhnall O’SullivanExternal link"
2020-12-21;Europe’s ski market crushed by Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/europe-s-ski-market-crushed-by-covid-19/46237062;Gérard Brudi, who rents two apartments to winter workers in the popular French ski resort of Val Thorens, has not had a single booking this year. Despite snow falling and sunny weather, the ski lifts are closed. The travel reps that would normally host guests have little more to do than check empty chalets for freezing pipes. Val Thorens can host about 50,000 visitors a week at peak but there are currently just a few thousand scattered weekend guests. “We are absolutely, as we French say, in incertitude,” said Mr Brudi. “People don’t rent flats or hotels at a high price just for sniffing the good fresh air. If I cannot ski, I am not interested.” The European Alps make up more than a third of the world’s 2,084 ski resorts, according to data from industry analyst, Laurent Vanat. Its ski season typically produces €28bn (CHF30bn) in revenues, also about a third of the global total and almost 7% of the overall value of the EU’s tourism market. But this season will generate nothing close to that. After Covid-19 cut short the busy Easter period during its initial spread through Europe in March — leaving operators and airlines scrambling to repatriate holidaymakers — a third wave looks set to wipe out bookings over Christmas and New Year. Many resorts across Austria and Italy are closed, while France has said all ski lifts will be shut until January 7. Switzerland has cautiously opened but is under pressure from its European neighbours to close again and with quarantine restrictions in place, international travel is all but banned. With the average price of a ski holiday from the UK to the Alps costing around £1,200, (CHF1,415) consumers are wary of committing as infection rates creep up across the continent and authorities change restrictions. Crystal Ski Holidays, the biggest company in the industry, said bookings were “well over” 50% down on last year’s levels. The operator usually sends about 170,000 tourists to the Alps each season but has halved its capacity from January onwards and cut the number of resorts it feeds by more than a fifth. Its nearest rival, Hotelplan, which is less than half Crystal Ski’s size, cancelled all bookings for December and January, as well as its annual Santa programme to Lapland. “The rest of the season is on a knife edge”, said Joe Ponte who became chief executive of Hotelplan in October. “As an operator we just have to understand the myriad different circumstances and communicate that to customers.” Owen Chapman, head of member services at Ski Club of Great Britain (SCGB), a tour operator and the UK’s oldest snow sports association, said bookings were 70% below last year. Because hotels were contracted and costs committed in advance, the company has had to cancel holidays six to ten weeks ahead or face steep losses. The closures and cancellations have left the ski holiday sector facing significant losses. Crystal Ski is owned by the travel group, Tui, which this month reported a record annual loss of €3.2bn. Crystal Ski and Hotelplan both said they had negotiated costs and capacity reductions with hoteliers to minimise the financial damage. But having lost a quarter of last season’s revenues after the onset of coronavirus, several smaller operators have already gone bankrupt. The 23-year-old UK-based chalet expert, Alpine Elements, was the latest to collapse into administration this month. Chris Hamblin, managing director of The Boutique Chalet Company, said that with 14 properties to let and next to no bookings, he was unsure how his company would adapt to the changing restrictions. “It’s so difficult to forward forecast at the moment.” If international skiers do decide to thwart government advice and travel, costs are high and connections few. EasyJet, the biggest carrier to Geneva, the Alps gateway airport, has cut more than three-quarters of its flights there for January. The few insurance companies willing to cover holidays against official guidance do not insure against catching Covid-19, although some will cover cancellation or curtailment as a result of the pandemic. “It’s very difficult to find that cover so you either take the risk and go without or pay a lot but not get the full cover,” said Mr Chapman of SCGB. Skiers must also be aware that the experience will not be the same as previous years. “We need to be very honest with customers that they can’t expect Austrian après or the Folie Douce [a well-known bar] in Val d’Isère to be what it used to be,” said Chris Logan, managing director of Crystal Ski. The Austrian resort of Ischgl — known as the “Ibiza of the Alps” — became one of the ten highest-risk areas for coronavirus in the spring, raising fears of a similar scenario this season. “Ischgl was an après party town, which they won’t be selling themselves on this year,” added Mr Logan. The European snow-sport industry is also facing challenges from Brexit. As well as British holidaymakers losing access to the European Health Insurance Card scheme, UK companies send about 25,000 seasonal workers to the Alps on UK contracts each year. From January, staff must be employed by companies on local contracts with the knock-on requirement that employees and businesses will have to pay social security contributions and abide by stricter working conditions, pushing up the cost of labour. Most operators said they would hire locally rather than fly workers out, while others have cut down their chalet operations staffed by UK hosts, which British skiers have traditionally favoured. There are some green shoots for ski resorts. Demand for the summer season surged as city dwellers made a rush to the mountains to escape lockdown tedium. Hotelplan said walking trips had increased from 25-55% of overall booking volumes with its adventure Explore brand in 2021. Accommodation bookings for the whole season — allowing remote workers to do their jobs from resorts if they can and ski on the side — have also boomed as has interest in alternatives to skiing. Sales of ski kit are at historic lows but retailers have noted more demand for cross country ski touring boots and bindings, while hotels in the French Alps, where lifts are closed, are marketing snowball fights, snowshoe walks, and at one a “pure altitude” massage. For now, most operators are holding on to hopes of a bumper 2021-22 season and have opened bookings early. “We already have several thousand booked for next season when typically we only have several hundred,” Mr Logan said, although many reservations had been pushed forward from this season. Xavier Schouller, managing director of Peak Retreats, another ski tour operator, noted that customers were using this year’s unspent holiday budget and trading up: “We have seen quite a lot more demand for upmarket accommodation than we would normally see.” He added that he was not “totally disappointed” that resorts had been forced to close: “Better to have the second part [of the season] than have a small bite at it, and lose the rest.” This article has been updated to clarify that Chris Hamblin, managing director of The Boutique Chalet Company, said he was unsure how his company would adapt to the changing restrictions, rather than whether his company would survive.

2020-12-21;Switzerland bans flights from UK over new coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-bans-flights-from-uk-over-new-coronavirus/46236946;Switzerland has joined other European countries in suspending flights from the United Kingdom and South Africa after reports of a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain. “Due to the new epidemiological situation in Britain and South Africa, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (OFAC) has suspended air traffic between Switzerland and these two countries until further notice from midnight Sunday,” the Swiss authorities said on Sunday in a statementExternal link. This emergency decision follows the “emergence of a new variant of coronavirus which, according to initial findings, is significantly more contagious”, it added. The variant, which officials say is up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has prompted concerns about a wider spread. It has reportedly spread. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that the new strain had led to spiralling infection numbers in the southeast of England. At least ten European countries, including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, said they were taking measures to prevent people arriving from Britain, including bans on flights and trains. France said it would bar all people coming from the UK for 48 hours from Sunday night, including freight carriers, whether by road, air, sea or rail. Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic also announced plans to bar flights from the United Kingdom. An epidemiologist at the University of Basel, Emma Hodcroft, said on Twitter that the strains in Britain and South Africa were not the same. ‘Highly problematic’ The government’s Covid task force considers the new variant of the coronavirus to be “highly problematic”. Switzerland is in a risk zone with a health system at the limit of its capacity, it said on Sunday. It pointed out that there are also seasonal factors such as increased mobility during the holiday season, winter sports and greater time spent indoors. The coronavirus variant has not yet been detected in the sequencing, the task force said. However, this does not mean that the variant is not yet on Swiss territory. In Switzerland, 100 to 300 samples would be sequenced per week, a very small proportion of cases, it said. The working group explained that if a variant of the virus spread rapidly, contacts would have to be limited drastically in order to reduce the number of cases, interrupt the chains of infection and thus slow the spread.
2020-12-20;A third are eager to be vaccinated against Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/a-third-are-eager-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19/46236336;Just over 35% of people surveyed in Switzerland want to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as soon as possible. In contrast, 57% don’t want the jab. Research institute Marketagent.com Switzerland released the results of its representative survey on Sunday. From December 4-14, the institute questioned 1,000 people aged 14-74 in German- and French-speaking Switzerland. According to the survey, a clear majority believe that the vaccine will provide protection (62%) and be safe (57%), and 63% trust that the Federal Office of Public Health will make the right decisions in providing a vaccine. Nevertheless, a majority (57%) either do not want or would rather not be vaccinated promptly. “Behind this contradiction is probably the hope that a broad vaccination of the population will lead to more normality,” explained Martina Staub of Marketagent.com Switzerland in a statement. This suggests that many people want to wait and see how the vaccine works out for others. In addition, there is scepticism towards new Covid-19 vaccines. A majority of the respondents (53%) agreed with the statement: “I am in favour of vaccination in principle, but in the case of the coronavirus I would not be vaccinated because we have too little experience with this vaccine”. Significantly more women agreed with this. According to the SonntagsZeitung Sunday newspaper, Swiss International Air Lines will introduce a compulsory coronavirus vaccination for numerous employees. SWISS told the newspaper it was “in principle not aiming for mandatory vaccination for employees”. However, the airline expects that proof of coronavirus vaccination will be required for entry into certain countries. It is therefore quite possible that this would also apply to pilots and flight attendants. Switzerland’s top politicians also plan to get vaccinated, as André Simonazzi, the spokesman for the federal government, told the Sonntagszeitung. “The Federal Council is getting vaccinated and recommends that citizens take advantage of the opportunity to be vaccinated against coronavirus,” Simonazzi said. 
2020-12-20;One in three people in Switzerland earning less this year;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/one-in-three-people-in-switzerland-earning-less-this-year/46236192;The Covid-19 pandemic is driving down wages in Switzerland: 34% of the population have seen their incomes drop in 2020 due to the coronavirus, either because of short-time work or as a result of being laid off. The data, reported by Sunday newspaper Le Matin Dimanche, emerge from a survey conducted in 24 countries by collection company Intrum. Faced with this situation, one in five Swiss (19%) were forced to postpone the payment of at least one invoice – a figure higher than that reported in a similar survey in 2018, when the percentage was 14.6%. “With the second wave of the pandemic and perhaps a third one coming in the spring, as well as drastic new measures taken by the federal government and the cantons, we can expect unemployment to rise at the end of the year, a phenomenon that will go hand in hand with further job losses,” Daniel Lampart, chief economist at the Swiss Trade Union Federation, told Le Matin Dimanche. “This will hurt a lot,” he pointed out. Almost a quarter (24%) of the people surveyed in Switzerland said they feared an additional decline in the near future. Last month the government agreed to extend the short-time working compensation and unemployment benefits. A bill to parliament foresees financial support for employees with fixed-term contracts, including apprentices.
2020-12-20;First Covid-19 vaccine approved for Swiss use;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/first-covid-19-vaccine-approved-for-swiss-use/46234782;Swiss health regulator Swissmedic has approved the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech. According to the Swiss authorities, the level of protection is over 90% a week after the second dose. Two months after receiving the application, Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has given the coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty® (BNT162b2) the green light. Based on the available data, the agency found a comparably high level of efficacy in all age groups that were tested. “The safety of patients is an essential prerequisite, especially where the authorisation of vaccines is concerned,” said Swissmedic Director Raimund Bruhin in a media releaseExternal link on Saturday. “Thanks to the rolling procedure and our flexibly organised teams, we nevertheless managed to reach a decision quickly – while also fully satisfying the three most important requirements of safety, efficacy and quality.” Anyone aged 16 and up can be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), subject to compliance with the federal government’s official vaccination recommendations. For optimum protection, Swissmedic suggests two intramuscular injections of the vaccine, spaced at least 21 days apart. The authorisation application for Comirnaty®, an mRNA vaccine, was submitted in mid-October and reviewed on an ongoing basis (“rolling submission”). The vaccine has already been approved in Britain, Canada, the United States and other countries. In addition to Pfizer/BioNTech, Switzerland has signed agreements with vaccine manufacturers Moderna and AstraZeneca. The Alpine country now has 15.8 million doses of vaccines on order from the three makers, pending approval from the health regulator. Swissmedic is also evaluating a vaccine from Janssen-Cilag. The federal government has ordered around three million doses of vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech. The first 107,000 doses of vaccine will arrive in Switzerland in the next few days, announced the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link on Saturday. The Armed Forces Pharmacy will store the vaccine at -70 degrees Celsius before distributing it to the cantons, which can store the vials in refrigerators for a maximum of five days. Canton Lucerne will launch its vaccination campaign on December 23, starting with vulnerable residents over 65. Basel City will begin on December 28. Nationwide vaccination is slated to start on January 4. Swissmedic’s vaccine approval came earlier than expected. Though it is good news, it also poses additional challenges for Switzerland’s thinly-stretched healthcare system. It is up to the cantons to decide how to staff and where to provide vaccination services. Sample locations are medical practices, gymnasiums and military facilities. The estimated two million people in risk groups should be vaccinated first, notes the health office. In addition to senior citizens, that includes people with diabetes, chronic lung disease or high blood pressure. Next in line are medical workers and relatives of the vulnerable. Swiss health authorities say it will be early spring before other people can be vaccinated. More than 6,000 people in Switzerland (pop. 8.5 million) have died of Covid-19. Over 400,000 have been infected.  
2020-12-19;New anti-corona measures: restaurants closed, ski areas open;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-anti-corona-measures--restaurants-closed--ski-areas-open/46232960;"Switzerland will close restaurants and bars for a month from Tuesday to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, while ski areas can remain open, the government says. The move comes as surrounding countries like Germany and Austria go into lockdown over the Christmas period. Shops will also remain open (with some restrictions), the government announced on Friday External linkafter a meeting to discuss the highly anticipated measures. Sports and leisure centres, as well as libraries, museums and other cultural institutions are to close. Cantons which have a reproduction rate number under 1 or a 7-day case average that is under the Swiss average may relax the measures for restaurants and sports centres. The government has faced pressure to tighten public health measures as new infection numbers remain high, with hospitals warning that this is putting pressure on the healthcare system. On Friday there were 4,478 new infections and 120 deaths, bringing to the total to over 6,000, the health authorities announcedExternal link. There have been more than 400,000 infections in the country since the pandemic started.The situation varies across cantons.  Earlier this week, the head of the Swiss national Covid-19 science task forceExternal link urged the country to impose a second lockdown, echoing calls by other scientists, officials and medical professionals. After easing strict measures imposed in March, Switzerland has refrained from ordering another shutdown, preferring the “special Swiss way” between health measures and keeping the economy going. It has been gradually tightening measures, ordering restaurants, bars and shops to close from 7pm across most of the country last Friday. Ski resorts can stay open, the government says. This stance has already angered the country’s neighbours who have shut theirs, citing concerns that skiing could lead to a spike in Covid cases. However, cantons are in charge and must give permission for resorts to open. Ski areas face strict cantonal conditions related to hygiene and sanitation protection measures; local hospitals close to ski resorts must also be able to cope with any additional patients. On Friday canton Lucerne said that it would already close its ski areas over Christmas due to the “very tense epidemiological situation” and the hospital situation, as did cantons Schwyz, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Zug. Ski areas will be closed from December 22-29 in these cantons. On Saturday, cantons Appenzell Inner Rhodes, Zurich, St Gallen and Uri followed suit. Larger ski areas in canton Bern and Valais will remain open. Canton Graubünden is expected to decide on Monday. The Swiss government said in a statement that the aim of its latest measures was  to reduce case numbers rapidly and substantially, to protect people from the virus, safeguard the health service and relieve the pressure on healthcare workers . It has also expanded the use of rapid tests. Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga added in a press conference in Bern announcing the measures that the government would assess the coronavirus situation again before the end of the year. And she warned: there could be stronger measures at the beginning of 2021 if the situation does not improve. Canton Aargau  - the cantons are in charge of health matters - has already announced stricter measures than the national ones, to start on midnight Sunday."
2020-12-18;Which Swiss companies made headlines in 2020?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/which-swiss-companies-made-headlines-in-2020-/46232402;Here’s a clue: coronavirus. It’s no surprise that most of the Swiss companies in the news in 2020 had some connection with the biggest story of the year – the pandemic. For a few weeks in 2020 it was possible to make it through a day without mention of Covid-19. That was back in late January when thousands of people gathered (without masks) in Davos to talk about a better kind of capitalism at the World Economic Forum annual meeting and we wrote stories about how Swiss companies were bracing for this strange new virus spreading in China. The idea that this virus could disrupt our life here in Switzerland seemed far off. This changed on March 17 when the Swiss government shut down public life as the virus swept across Europe’s borders. There are no winners in this pandemic but there are companies that have been riding its wave, and others that have drowned in its wake. As the year comes to a close, here’s a look at which Swiss companies caught the attention of swissinfo.ch readers across our ten languages. 1. With no prospects for profits, big pharma neglects new infectious diseases – One of the most read articles across languages, the story revealed how big pharma’s decision to shun infectious diseases in favour of more lucrative areas left gaping holes in the fight against epidemics like the one caused by the novel coronavirus. Since that time, companies have been desperately trying to play catch up. Roche found a niche in Covid-19 testing but Novartis’ high hopes for hydroxychloroquine were dashed. Whether the pandemic will be a real wake-up call for the industry is still to be seen. 2. Responsible business initiative rejected at the ballot box – Ten years in the making, it’s no surprise that the November 29 vote attracted a lot of attention far beyond Swiss borders. The German version was the most read multinationals story in the language. In the lead-up to the vote, readers wanted to know why companies fear the initiative, why there are so many multinationals in risky sectors in Switzerland, and how the initiative compares with laws in other countries. 3. Why Switzerland's Moderna Covid-19 vaccine deal is risky – It is not exactly a Swiss company, but the Boston-based biotech Moderna announced it was setting up an office in Basel just around the time it signed a vaccine deal with the Swiss government. Moderna also thrust Swiss chemical firm Lonza into the spotlight after it agreed a deal to scale up vaccine manufacturing. The story was also one of the most read in Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. I wrote that the deal was risky because it called into question Switzerland’s commitment to a fair distribution of vaccines. What’s changed? Here’s our latest story on how the scramble for vaccines is leaving millions of people behind. 4. Is Venezuela’s gold a liability for Switzerland? – Amid the pandemic, tensions rose over how to stamp out illegally mined gold that makes its way to Switzerland, which is home to many big gold refineries. The Venezuela story was the most read in Spanish along with stories about how the pandemic is driving more illegal mining in Peru and a rare interview with refiner PX Precinox CEO Philippe Chave. In August, pressure mounted on Swiss refinery Valcambi over goldExternal link purchased from Dubai traders. The company continues to deny sourcing “dirty” gold and is now taking action against the NGO that brought the allegations. To be continued in 2021. 5. ‘In Indonesia palm oil is bigger than watchmaking is for Switzerland’External link – In June, my colleague Anand Chandrasekhar talked to Indonesia’s ambassador to Switzerland about a referendum launched against a free trade deal that critics argue undermines efforts to stop environmental devastation caused by palm oil. The referendum is expected to come to a vote in March 2021. 6. Nestlé struggles to win over baby formula critics External link– One of the most read in Arabic, Russian and Japanese, this looked into Nestlé’s plans to diversify its formula milk offerings to fill nutritional gaps, particularly in older infants. Critics say the new products are simply a marketing ploy. 7. Colonialism: How Swiss multinationals set their sights on the world – Beyond the pandemic, 2020 was also defined by a reckoning on racism and colonial ties. My colleague Andrea Tognina looked at how Swiss multinationals benefited from colonialism even if the country wasn’t technically a colonial power. A few months ago, researchers discovered that the city of Zurich profited from the slave tradeExternal link, particularly in the 18th century. 8. Why Nestlé’s millions to protect an African forest could backfire – Chocolate makers found themselves on the defensive over cocoa sourcing from West Africa in 2020. Companies like Nestlé and Barry Callebaut have made lofty commitments and invested millions to end deforestation and child labour but progress has been slow. One major study found that the situation for children in cocoa areas has even worsened over the last decade. 9. Pandemic rattles already vulnerable antibiotics market – As we battle the coronavirus, another pandemic is looming that has received little attention. Most of the big pharma companies have moved out of novel antibiotic development because it isn’t profitable. In July, a coalition of big companies created a $1 billion fund for antibiotics but some say it is just a band-aid and doesn’t address underlying problems in the antibiotics market. 10.  Can commodity traders get a grip on their soy supply chains? – The answer: it’s complicated. Big commodity traders like Glencore and Bunge are trying to trace their soy purchases in the Cerrado to avoid deforestation. But as my colleague writes, the incentives for farmers to produce sustainable soy just aren’t there. There were a few honourable mentions. Are there any stories you think we missed? Are there any stories we should have our eye on in 2021? Send me a message: jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch Thanks for reading and wishing you a safe and happy holidays. 
2020-12-18;Swiss central bank continues to vacuum up foreign currencies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-central-bank-continues-to-vacuum-up-foreign-currencies/46232846;The Swiss National Bank (SNB) spent almost CHF25 billion ($28 billion) in the foreign currency markets in the third quarter, raising its reserves to CHF938 billion so far this year. Two days ago, Switzerland was branded a currency manipulator by the United States. The latest figures, released on Friday, show the rate of foreign currency intervention slowed between July and the end of September. In the first six months of the year the SNB had poured CHF90 billion into applying the brakes on the franc’s rising value. At the same time, the SNB’s current account surplus decreased from CHF13 billion in June to CHF9 billion in September. This is another key parameter on the US currency manipulation watchlist. The coronavirus pandemic has only increased investor interest in the franc, while the US dollar has generally fallen in value against other currencies this year. At its quarterly monetary policy meeting on Thursday, the SNB vowed to continue with its foreign currency intervention. Had we not intervened, the franc would have appreciated significantly more, and this would have placed an additional burden on our economy in an already exceptionally challenging environment, noted Andréa Maechler, a member of the SNB governing board. The US ambassador to Switzerland Ed McMullen played down the currency manipulation debate, telling Le Temps newspaper that it was a “purely mechanical decision” that bears little resemblance in tone to a manipulation claim issued against China last year. Martin Naville, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, has also sought to downplay the dispute. In an open letter with the sub-heading “let’s not get overly excitedExternal link”, Naville urges people to “relax” and “look at the facts” rather than rely on the “breathless reporting” of the media. “Looking at the development of the Swiss Franc–US Dollar exchange rate, it is clear that there is currently either no currency manipulation or Switzerland is doing a very poor job. In the last 20 years, the Swiss Franc appreciated 100% to the US Dollar! In 2001, one Swiss Franc cost US$ 0.57, today it costs US$ 1.14! Tell me about manipulation,” he writes.
2020-12-17;Second Covid wave much more stressful than first;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/second-covid-wave-much-more-stressful-than-first/46231298;Twice as many people in Switzerland are suffering from severe depression in the second wave of coronavirus as in the first wave, according to the latest survey on the pandemic and mental health. The online survey of more than 11,000 people across the country found that 20% of people experienced maximum stress levels during the second wave in November compared with 11% during the peak of the first wave in April. The share of people with symptoms of severe depression rose from 9% to 18% in the same period. Only 3% reported such symptoms prior to the pandemic. Young people are particularly affected, with the share reporting symptoms of depression decreasing with age. Some 29% of 14- to 24-year-olds reported feeling depressed compared with only 6% for those 65 years and older. One of the major factors contributing to psychological stress and depression is pressure caused by Covid-related changes at work, school or training. The authors also cite stress from financial losses, increased conflict at home and fears about the future. The rates of depression were up to 28% for those experiencing financial stress. People working in a sector affected financially by government measures such as restaurants, culture or tourism are strongly affected. In addition, rates were higher in the French-speaking part of the country, which faced the highest infection rates and most restrictive safety measures in November. Overall, researchers found a correlation between the strength of the second wave (incidence of new infections) and the frequency of severe depressive symptoms in the cantons. The survey also found more participants were concerned that a loved one might become seriously ill or die from Covid-19. The research team found that physically active people had, on average, slightly less stress. They also encouraged people to seek help from specialists. A small anonymous self-assessment test for depressive symptoms is available at coronastress.ch. Given the high rates of young people affected, the study authors encourage schools to explore their role and pursue a flexible approach to the school curriculum. The second online survey was led by the University of Basel as part of the Swiss Corona Stress Study.
2020-12-17;Swiss tourism urged to become ‘more local and more digital’ in 2021;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-tourism-urged-to-become--more-local-and-more-digital--in-2021/46231052;2020 has been particularly difficult for Swiss tourism, but experts say there is reason to hope for the industry if it focuses more on digital technologies and local offers next year. “2021 will be a year of transition, starting with digesting the effects of the coronavirus crisis,” said Nicolas Délétroz, a professor at the Tourism Institute of the University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland. But tourism will be forced to become more local and digital, he added. Tourism has suffered in Switzerland, above all in cities. Between May and October the number of overnight stays fell sharply in Geneva (-78%), the Zurich region (-73%) and Basel (-63%) owing to the absence of foreign tourists, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) said. Jürg Stettler of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts said the desire to travel was also likely to remain low. “We expect foreign demand to pick up slowly in 2021, depending on the number of coronavirus cases and vaccinations,” he said. This demand would come first from nearby markets and then, in the second half of the year, from more distant countries such as China, according to Stettler. However, he pointed out that those Swiss cities which in the past would have attracted a high number of foreign shopping tourists or business travellers would probably continue to be hit hard by the aftermath of the crisis. In 2019 foreign travellers spent around CHF18 billion ($20.4 billion) in Switzerland, according to the FSO. Meanwhile, online tools could help, according to the experts. “Digital advertising, especially on mobile phones, has more impact because the number of people looking for tourism offers on a smartphone has increased significantly in recent months,” Stettler said. Destinations off the beaten track would also invest in these tools more and more, he predicted. Stettler stressed it was also increasingly important, especially in a country as small as Switzerland, to offer a combination of more affordable accommodation and the promotion of local products. “This should also increase the desire of Swiss people to travel again,” he believed. At the same time the desire for foreign destinations should also be rekindled, according to Walter Kunz, director of the Swiss Travel Association. “If there’s a vaccine and people cope with the virus better, that could help,” he said. “Especially as people are fed up with the restrictions and want to go on holiday to the sea again.”
2020-12-17;Covid-19 vaccine: Why we still have a long wait ahead;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-close-are-we-to-vaccinating-the-world-against-covid-19-/46227704;"Countries have started rolling out a Covid-19 vaccine, but it will likely take years to manufacture doses at the scale needed to reach the masses in Switzerland and much of the rest of the world. Light appeared at the end of the pandemic tunnel when a 90-year-old grandmother in the United Kingdom received the world’s first dose of Pfizer/BioNtech’s Covid-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial, on December 8. The companies did in about 10 months what had never been done in fewer than four years. Vaccinations in Switzerland are expected to start in January if the approval process goes according to plan for either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. However, making these vaccines available to the masses won’t happen right away. The Swiss government estimates three-quarters of the population will be vaccinated by summer 2021. But a projection made by the London-based science analytics company Airfinity, at the request of SWI swissinfo.ch, predicts it could be spring 2022 before mass vaccination happens and vaccine-based herd immunity is reached in Switzerland. “Clinical trial results from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech exceeded expectations but we need to be realistic. There will be bumps along the road,” said Thomas Cueni, Director General of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, at a media briefing last week. “For the next few months life will remain difficult in most countries,” he added. Even if vaccines are approved by regulators in the coming months, producing and distributing them safely at scale will take much longer. Here are some reasons for this projected timeline. Countries have shelled out billions of dollars to order more than 11 billion doses of vaccines – some of which may ultimately prove ineffective and be tossed aside. The US has pre-ordered the most with 800 million doses secured and an option to add another 1.6 billion. The actual number of people this will cover is lower given that the two leading vaccine candidates require two doses. Switzerland has signed agreements with the makers of the three most advanced vaccine candidates (Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca) to secure more than 15.8 million doses for a population of 8.5 million. It is also part of the COVAX Initiative – a global Covid-19 vaccine procurement and equitable distribution effort – that will provide doses for 20% of the Swiss population. On a per-capita basis, this puts Switzerland in the top ten countries in terms of vaccine procurement. But because pre-orders have been made by a select number of largely wealthy countriesExternal link, they don’t reflect the actual worldwide demand of the more than 7.8 billion people on the planet. According to the latest data by Airfinity, vaccine manufacturers have the capacity to make around 14 billion doses. In September, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, told the Financial TimesExternal link that pharmaceutical companies were not increasing production capacity quickly enough and that there won’t be enough for everyone in the world until 2024 at the earliest. The Institute is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, producing some 1.5 billion doses of various inoculations every year. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna estimate that, among them, they can make 5.2 billion doses by the end of next year, which could cover the vaccination needs of around one-third of the world’s population. For some vaccines like AstraZeneca’s, the number of doses ordered outstrips the expected supply.   Most of these companies’ capacity is already secured in agreements and therefore won’t be distributed equally around the world. It is unclear how companies prioritise which countries receive ordered doses. According to this data, vaccine candidates that have the most production capacity are not necessarily those closest to approval or fastest to produce. The most advanced vaccines such as the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna use new techniques, which require building or upgrading factories and production lines. A surveyExternal link of 100 manufacturers conducted in spring and published in June by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) found almost no MRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world. This is why those vaccines are not expected to reach the masses quickly although they were the first out of the gate. The Serum Institute in India has focused on more conventional viral vaccines and has saidExternal link it won’t be able to manufacture mRNA vaccines  until next yearExternal link. It has already signed on to manufacture candidates from Astra Zeneca and Novovax, which explains these vaccines’ higher projected production levels. The Institute has also signed deals with COVAX to manufacture up to 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, priced at a maximum of $3 per dose. Moderna and BioNTech are leaning on large pharma companies to bring manufacturing muscle. Swiss-based Lonza has stepped in to build four production lines for the Moderna vaccine, three of which are located in Visp, in south-west Switzerland, with the other in the US. These four sites will produce enough vaccine for up to 400 million doses. Lonza is producing the active ingredients, which is the most complicated part, but the vaccine will then be shipped to so-called “fill and finish partners” selected by Moderna. They include Catalent in the US and ROVI in Spain. It is unclear where the fill and finish capacity currently lies. Airfinity told SWI swissinfo.ch that machines siphon fluid into millions of vials and syringes before each one is hand-checked for quality. Many plants today can fill and finish tens of thousands of vaccine doses per hour, but when the immediate need is for billions of doses, even the fastest robotic filling arm can be too slow to meet demand. Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary Janssen Vaccines in Switzerland is also involved in the sterile filling and delivery of its vaccine for phase one and phase three trials. A company spokesman said that further clinical trials, planned as part of the broad approval process, will be supported by clinical trial samples from the company’s Bern site. Building a new vaccine facility can take five to ten years and billions to get up and running. Public health advocates have been calling on companies to support open licensing of their vaccine technologies in order to allow others, particularly in lower income countries, to produce the vaccines, and increase capacity. Countries and companies are also hedging their bets across vaccine candidates because as the Center for Global Development points out, second-generation vaccines are often more effective than first-generation.   “We need to be careful about committing all spare manufacturing capacity to the first candidates. While many vaccine factories are fungible, switching production between candidates can be slow and complex,” the Center writes in a reportExternal link. Reinhard Glück, who worked in vaccine development for 30 years including at former Swiss vaccine firm Berna Biotech, told SWI swissinfo.ch that it is always true in the pharma sector that once a superior product comes on the market, the less effective version stops being used. The production process itself also takes time. This varies by type of vaccine but can also depend on how fast authorities carry out safety checks, which by some estimates takes 70% of the manufacturing time. It has been widely reported that it is faster and cheaper to make an mRNA vaccine than for adenovirus vectored DNA vaccine like Astra Zeneca’s and recombinant protein-based vaccines like that being developed by Sanofi/GSK. According to experts interviewed by swissinfo.ch, the latter can take six months to produce a batch. The advanced mRNA vaccines are currently based on a two-dose regimen. In contrast, J&J told SWI swissinfo.ch that while its vaccine might be more complex to manufacture, its big advantage is that it is being tested as a single-dose regimen. The technology has already been used to develop vaccines against Ebola and Zika. Each production stage can demand up to 450 quality checks. Any potential problems with the formulation at any stage could result in the entire batch being discarded. According to the Swiss Therapeutics Law, all batches of vaccines marketed in Switzerland must be tested by an authorised laboratory before being released. Every monthExternal link, the regulatory body Swissmedic updates the list of approved batches. The process is so meticulous that vaccines are usually only produced in a single factory, and each facility’s batch must be treated as a new product for the purposes of regulation. Philippe Paroz, a microbiologist who worked in vaccine safety including at Berna Biotech, compared the process to cooking. “If you are cooking mayonnaise at home, it's not proven that the same recipe will work in your neighbour’s kitchen. The same is true for vaccines.” Bottlenecks can also happen at different stages. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Pfizer slashed its production targets for its Covid-19 vaccine because of a lack of raw materials for its supply chain. At a media briefing after these reports, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that “If there were available more machinery, more technology and more raw materials, we wouldn’t make 1.3 billion, we’d make 2 or 3 billion. Right now, we are exhausting our capacity, and that of our suppliers after looking all over the world to find people who know what we are doing.” In an email, Lonza spokesperson Sanna Fowler told SWI swissinfo.ch that “potential bottlenecks on our side are sourcing equipment and raw materials as well as access to contractors and hiring and training new staff”. But she said that the company is on track to meet its goals and expects to start production in Visp before the end of the year. Raw materials and equipment can mean anything from bio reactors and filtration and chromatography equipment to filling machines and glass vials. There is little data available on the global volume of such supplies; most glass vial production takes place in China.   Manufacturing manpower may also be a bottleneck; it can take more than 50 trained technicians to control quality when manufacturing biological vaccines, while only one is needed for medicines. Once vaccines are ready, getting them to hospitals and doctors’ offices in countries with very different infrastructure and climate conditions poses a host of challenges. MRNA vaccines are easier to develop and manufacture quickly but harder to deliver and administer because they need to be kept at very cold temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature at or below –70 degrees Celsius. The World Health Organization estimates that up to half of vaccines are wasted every year, often because of inadequate temperature control in supply chains. Swiss company Skycell has developed temperature-controlled logistics containers with monitoring devices to ensure the vaccines stay stable. Companies say they have thermometers as well as sensor and tracking technology to make sure vaccines remain at stable temperatures. But the temperature issue still concerns Glück who is advising Spicona on its Covid-19 vaccine. “We need a vaccine which is stable, also in warm temperatures,” he says. “A vaccine that has to be kept at minus 20 degrees is not a vaccine that can reach everyone.” Johnson & Johnson says it plans to use the same cold chain technologies it uses to transport treatments for cancer and immunological disorders. And how will countries perform mass immunisation once the batches arrive? The Swiss government is setting up centres and aims to vaccinate 70,000 people per day, starting with high-risk groups. It also plans to make the vaccine free of charge. Worldwide, some companies have said that they will charge different prices for the vaccine depending on a country’s GDP levels. The WHO regional director for AfricaExternal link recently said that countries on that continent are far from being ready to vaccinate because they have not yet identified priority populations or set up tools for tracking and reporting results. And since at least 60% of a population must take a vaccine to achieve mass immunity, some fear that vaccine skepticism that could thwart the rollout in some parts of the world. The scale and speed of the vaccine rollout leaves many questions unanswered. Even if a vaccine passes the safety tests, experience with other new vaccines shows that more will come to light along the way about the vaccine's effects on different demographic groups. Some expertsExternal link have also criticised the design of the trials for not investigating whether the vaccines prevented severe Covid-19 illness and transmission of infection. Companies and officials have given assurances that they haven’t cut any corners on safety, but there are no comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies available on the available Covid-19 vaccines. On December 1, Switzerland’s medical regulator Swissmedic said it lacked the necessary information to sign off on the three different coronavirus vaccines ordered by the government. There are also questions about whether the vaccines will work in the face of virus mutations, as have been reported in parts of Europe. It also isn’t clear how long immunity lasts, and whether and when people might need a booster shot. “There is a lot that could go wrong, and companies aren’t incentivised to talk about it,” said Anthony McDonnell, a policy analyst in the health team at the Centre for Global Development. Glück also worries that so much has been invested in these vaccine candidates that they’ve become “too big to fail”. “Taxpayers have invested so much, there is a sense that we have to keep going no matter what. That’s my fear.”"
2020-12-17;Former Swiss president and EU champion Flavio Cotti dies ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/former-swiss-president-and-un-champion-flavio-cotti-dies--/46229758;Former Swiss president Flavio Cotti, who championed Switzerland’s accession to the United Nations and the European Union, died of complications related to Covid at the age of 81. Cotti was also instrumental in brokering a Swiss bank settlement for Jewish victims of the Holocaust and determining Switzerland’s relationship with the EU in the 1990s. He chaired the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1996. Flavio Cotti will be remembered as a champion of consensus building, the government said in a statement on Thursday. Rooted in the Catholic culture and marked by a strong sense of Christian humanism [...] he was open to change.   “It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of Flavio Cotti. His political spirit continues to breathe life into the foreign ministry,” said the current Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, also from the Italian-speaking Ticino region, on Twitter. Cotti died on Wednesday afternoon in a hospital in Locarno after complications due to coronavirus , according to local media. A lawyer by training, Cotti was a member of the Christian Democratic Party of Ticino before rising through the ranks and spending 12 years in the Swiss government from 1987 to 1999 where he first served as interior minister and later changed to the foreign ministry. He held the Swiss rotating presidency twice, in 1991 and 1998. He is most remembered for his time as foreign minister, where he was instrumental in bringing Switzerland closer to international agencies. He advocated for Switzerland’s accession to the UN and defended Geneva as the seat of international bodies such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). Switzerland eventually became the 190th member of the UN in 2002. Before resigning, he successfully concluded bilateral negotiations with the EU after Swiss voters rejected a plan for the country to become a member of the European Economic Area in 1992. A staunch supporter of Europe, he defended Switzerland's full participation in the EU. Cotti was also at the head of the foreign ministry during tense negotiations on unclaimed funds deposited in Swiss banks by Holocaust victims. In 1997, Cotti announced the decision to share control of a Holocaust memorial fund with leading Jewish groups that had been set up after criticism of Switzerland’s financial dealings with Nazi Germany.
2020-12-17;Geneva Science and Diplomacy start-up marks new stage ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-science-and-diplomacy-start-up-marks-new-stage-/46228706;"Amid high expectations, a Swiss government-sponsored foundation that aims to connect the worlds of science and diplomacy is entering a new phase towards launching concrete projects.  On Thursday the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA), launched in 2019, unveiled a list of almost 100 diplomats and scientists who will meet to discuss how to implement recommendations identified in previous reports. This meeting, which will be held on Friday, will be a virtual one due to the coronavirus.  After months of preparation, the plan is to examine key scientific advances likely to emerge over the next 5-25 years, before ultimately proposing how GESDA’s initial scientific findings can be put to good use.   These include areas such as advanced artificial intelligence, genome-editing, neuro-enhancement, decarbonisation and “computational diplomacy”. This refers to the possible re-definition of international relations thanks to communication tools, new algorithms and computing power.  Things now seem to be clearer for this new NGO, which has been a long time in gestation and which raised much expectations, but whose workings have not been obvious to the public.   GESDA Board chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, the former chairman and CEO of the Nestlé group, says the organisation’s aim is to “bring together different communities” such as academia, diplomacy and civil society, to “anticipate advances in frontier scientific work (…) and to develop around them new initiatives, projects and solutions for humanity”. “GESDA is both a think tank and a do tank,” he stresses.  In its early days, some observers expressed concern that GESDA might just be a government-sponsored talking shop. NGO Swissaid said it seemed to lack transparency and that the links of its top two people (Brabeck-Letmathe and Patrick Aebischer, former head of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne EPFL) with Swiss multinational Nestlé were problematic.  GESDA nevertheless seems to have established an impressive cross-sector line-up. As well as scientific experts from around the world, its “Diplomacy Forum” unveiled on Thursday includes UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and president of the ICRC Peter Maurer, as well as Swiss Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Jürg Lauber.   Announcing the launch of GESDA in February 2019, Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said it would concentrate not so much on the “classic” humanitarian concerns of International Geneva but on the challenges of the future, such as how rapidly evolving new technology should be regulated. He gave the example of drones and automated vehicles, as well as genetic engineering.    International Geneva must be positioned as the best place to discuss the emerging issues that will dominate the global agenda in the coming decades, he said; the city must make sure that its reputation is strong enough to withstand competition.    The Swiss Confederation is providing CHF3 million ($3.4 million) in initial funding for GESDA’s pilot phase (2019-2022), while the city and canton of Geneva are each contributing CHF300,000 for the same period. Sponsors are also expected to contribute funds. GESDA’s Science Communication and Outreach director Olivier Dessibourg told SWI swissinfo.ch that its funds have been “partly matched” by a philanthropic foundation and it has a team working on fundraising for projects.  During its first three years, GESDA’s science and diplomacy experts are expected to meet, identify the issues to be addressed and launch the foundation’s first projects. So then what happens?  “From now, we have one big year to show that what we are doing is useful and makes sense,” said Dessibourg. GESDA has to show that its methodology is viable and its projects can have impact. At the end of 2021 it will have to go back to its founders to convince them of its future.  GESDA seems to be taking a new step forward, but it still has to prove itself."
2020-12-16;Swiss resorts struggle with safety measures for Covid-free slopes;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-resorts-struggle-with-safety-measures-for-covid-free-slopes/46214282;Swiss ski resorts have ploughed ahead with preparations for the year-end holiday season despite pressure from neighbouring countries on Switzerland to close its pistes until the latest coronavirus wave passes. Germany, Italy and France pushed for Swiss resorts to close until January but Switzerland – already hard hit by the lack of foreign tourists – and its eastern neighbour Austria are reluctant to further damage a sector worth billions to their economies. The Swiss government refused to buckle under pressure and decided on December 4 to allow ski areas to open during the holidays. Health Minister Alain Berset says the decision was intended “above all for people living in Switzerland”. From December 22, all ski resorts will have to prove they have met strict safety standards to obtain cantonal permits to remain open. 
2020-12-16;Switzerland branded as currency manipulator by US;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-branded-as-currency-manipulator-by-us/46228164;The United States has labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators in what may be one of the final broadsides by the Trump administration to international trading partners. Three other new names were added to a watch list of countries it suspects of taking measures to devalue their currencies against the US dollar. It marked the first time that the US has labeled another country as a currency manipulator since August 2019 when it called out China at a time when the world's two largest economies were locked in tense trade negotiations. In its annual reportExternal link the US Department of the Treasury on Wednesday accused Switzerland and Vietnam of intervening in currency markets through June 2020 to prevent effective balance of payment adjustments. In a first reaction, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) said it would not alter its monetary policy despite Switzerland's being named a currency manipulator by the US Treasury, adding the central bank remained willing to act aggressively on Forex markets. “The SNB’s monetary policy approach remains unchanged by the report,” the SNB said in a statement. “In light of the economic situation and the fact that the Swiss franc is still highly valued, the SNB remains willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market.” On Thursday, a day after the US threat, the SNB kept its interest rates at -0.75% and repeated it was prepared to add to the CHF90 billion stockpile of foreign currencies it has accumulated in the first six months of this year alone. Andréa Maechler, a member of the SNB governing board, said the Swiss franc has appreciated 5% in real terms since the start of the year. Had we not intervened, the franc would have appreciated significantly more, and this would have placed an additional burden on our economy in an already exceptionally challenging environment, she said. Foreign exchange analysts had broadly anticipated the US Treasury designation for the two countries. The designation will trigger special negotiations over the next year, and if they are not successful in resolving the issue, the US can move forward to impose economic sanctions on Vietnam and Switzerland. The action comes as the global coronavirus pandemic skews trade flows and widens US deficits with trading partners, an irritant to Trump, who won office four years ago partly on a promise to close the US trade gap. To be labeled a manipulator, countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus (CHF17.7 billion) bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of Gross Domestic Product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP. The US Treasury also said its monitoring list of countries that meet some of the criteria has grown to ten with the additions of Taiwan, Thailand and India. Others on the list include China, Japan, Korea, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Malaysia.
2020-12-16;Switzerland among best placed to recover from Covid crisis ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-among-best-placed-to-recover-from-covid-crisis-/46227664;Switzerland is among the countries best equipped to withstand the effects of the global pandemic, although no nation has emerged unscathed, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).  The Alpine country does well on several of the indicators used in a WEF report released Wednesday in Geneva. Replacing its usual annual Global Competitiveness Index, the WEF report on “how countries are performing on the road to recovery” looks at “how economies should think about revival and transformation as they recover and redesign their economic systems to enhance human development and compatibility with the environment”.  Switzerland comes third out of 40 countries on the quality of public institutions and on labour policies and social protection that can help it to face new challenges. It is also among those best prepared for a digital economy that facilitates telework, according to the report, which is based on a survey of business leaders.  Another plus factor, according to the WEF, is that Switzerland has succeeded in planning and activating health, fiscal and social policies that have helped to better mitigate the effects of the crisis.  Meanwhile, a separate report by the mobile analytics company Opensignal puts Switzerland in the top ten countries for the quality of group video calls, which it says have become invaluable during the coronavirus crisis. Switzerland comes in ninth out of 75 countries, according to this report. Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea share first spot*. Algeria comes in last out of the countries covered.  * Correction: the original version of this article stated that Japan was awarded first spot, followed by the Netherlands and South Korea.
2020-12-16;Countries still far from achieving sustainable development;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/countries-still-far-from-achieving-sustainable-development/46226074;The latest United Nations Human Development Report has found that countries, including Switzerland, still struggle to achieve high levels of human development without straining the planet. The coronavirus pandemic is only the latest crisis confronting our planet. If people don’t release their grip on nature, other crises are likely to come. That’s one of the big takeaways from the most recent UN Human Development ReportExternal link published on December 15. This is the first time countries' carbon dioxide emissions and material footprints are included in the definition of progress. SWI swissinfo.ch spoke with Pedro Conceição, a UN official in charge of the report, via Skype from his offices in New York. SWI swissinfo.ch: What are the conclusions of the report that struck you the most? Pedro Conceição: There are two things, that really surprised me. The first is tied to the new reality that we are facing as humanity. There is no precedent, neither in our history nor in the history of the planet. I am not just thinking about climate change but also the loss of biodiversity and the exploitation of raw materials. The impact of this change is so dramatic, that scientists talk about a new geological time age – the Anthropocene. The second thing that struck me concerns inequality. Human activity puts pressure on the planet, but not everyone bears the same responsibility and is impacted the same way. Those who suffer the consequences are not necessarily those who are damaged or who exploited the planet’s resources. The weakest are the ones who suffer the most. SWI: How has the coronavirus pandemic impacted human development around the world? P.C.: We don’t know the exact origins of the new coronavirus, but we know, that the number of zoonotic diseases is on the rise and that has increased along with the increased pressure on nature and the planet. Covid-19 has an important impact on inequality, for example on gender-specific inequality: women suffer more than men. It also touches almost all three building blocks of the Human Development Index (HDI), and almost everyone in the world. Coronavirus has an impact on our health, not only directly, but also indirectly, because it puts the health system under pressure. Immunisation rates are falling in many developing countries, which could lead to an increase in child mortality. We also know that the economic downturn is having a negative impact on incomes. And finally, education also suffers: many children around the world can continue to go to school as long as they have a computer, electricity, and an internet connection. In countries with a low HDI, some 86% of children don’t have these conditions and are effectively unable to continue learning. In countries that rank high on the index, the rate is 20%. SWI: A material footprint is included in the report for the first time. How did this change the global ranking of the Human Development Index? P.C. For 30 years we’ve seen progress lead to improvements in human development. However, we can’t neglect the pressure this has put on the planet. That’s why we have included a new index, the PHDI, that considers CO2 emissions and the material footprint. The key finding is that no one country achieved a very high level of human development without putting a strain on the planet.  We see a big gap between the two indices in countries that rely on fossil fuels for their energy supply. There are, however, countries, including Costa Rica, Panama and Moldova, which have a very high human development but place less burden on the planet. This is an important message: it is possible to have a high human development and a low burden on the planet. SWI: Switzerland ranked second on the HDI 2019 index, just behind Norway. Can it be considered a good example with this new environmental index? P.C.: The difference between the two indices is not very big for Switzerland. This indicates that Switzerland is on its way to a less intensive use of fossil fuels for its energy supply. However, you can’t talk about a pattern as there is no country that behaves as it should. SWI: At the last G20 Summit, Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga called on industrialised countries to build a more sustainable plan for the economic reconstruction after the pandemic. Are we headed in the right direction? P.C: Everyone can decide how to distribute the resources for the recovery: we can either continue putting pressure on natural resources or we can invest in the future. We know that the current way of consuming and producing doesn’t align with our goals. If we don’t change, what we are now experiencing with Covid-19 will become the norm. The European Union, China, Japan and Switzerland have all made commitments, however, to reach net-zero emissions. This is encouraging even if there is a need for more ambition. SWI: The first human development report was published in 1990. Which trends predicted 30 years ago have been confirmed? Instead of making predictions, the report sought to change perspectives on development. The first edition said that people should be the focus of development and not the economy. This reformulation helped initiate different approaches to tracking human development. The first report introduced the Human Development Index, which includes an income indicator but combines it with advances in health and education. This counteracts the view that development should be measured in terms of gross domestic product.

Calls for urgent action and a second lockdown are becoming louder. New infections rose by 4,271 on Tuesday. There were 103 more deaths. The seven-day average of new positive daily cases stands at 4,283; this is 10% more than the previous week. Cantons say they are currently treating 3,073 people in hospital for Covid-19. “There is a clear significant rise in cases,” Patrick Mathys, head of crisis management at the Federal Office of Public Health, told reporters on Tuesday. One could even already speak of a third wave, he said. “We need effective measures to reduce the pressure on the health system. We need to take hospitals’ calls for help seriously. Staff are at their limits and can’t offer the services that they need to,” Mathys underlined. Andreas Stettbacher, head of the centre of competence for military and disaster medicine, said that 78% of intensive care beds were currently being used. Covid patients are currently making up 57% of intensive care patients. “Patients in intensive care need a lot of resources,” Stettbacher said. Martin Ackermann, head of the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Taskforce,External link had clear words. “The taskforce has concluded that the new measures introduced last Friday are insufficient. From a scientific point of view we should have new measures as quickly as possible – similar to the lockdown in spring. Non-essential shops should be closed,” he said. Ackermann said the taskforce was concerned that there would be more close contacts and mobility over the holidays. From a scientific point of view “every day counts”. In response to a question about school closures, Ackermann said it would make sense to keep schools shut for a while after the holidays to ensure that infections incurred during this time did not make their way into schools. Last Friday, the government ordered restaurants, bars, shops and markets to close at 7pm from December 12 until January 22. Regions less badly hit by the pandemic are still allowed to have locations open until 11pm.  The government is expected to make an announcement next Friday about possible additional pandemic measures. It has so far tried to avoid a locking down the country as in spring, preferring a middle course between shutting the economy and stemming the pandemic. The director of the Zurich University Hospital, one of Switzerland's largest public hospitals, said on Tuesday that he could not see how Switzerland could avoid another lockdown due to the rising cases. Gregor Zünd said at a joint Zurich hospitals’ media briefing that he feared a third coronavirus wave mid-January after the skiing holidays. Switzerland has not closed its resorts over the holiday period in a move which has not been appreciated by its neighbours. Zurich University Hospital was among five university hospitals to send a warning to Interior Minister Alain Berset about overburdened medical institutions due to the influx of Covid-19 patients, it emerged at the weekend."
2020-12-15;Léman Express upbeat despite pandemic and other problems ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/l%C3%A9man-express-upbeat-despite-pandemic-and-other-problems-/46225108;The Léman Express rail network between Switzerland and France launched a year ago has faced numerous challenges but remains confident, says its director.  We absolutely have to stabilise quality now and work on recent problems, Mario Werren told Swiss public broadcaster RTS. I am very confident that the need is already proven. Prior to Covid, we reached passenger figures that were only expected in three to four years.   Officially launched on December 15 last year, the rail network’s first problem was a French strike which meant it could initially only be put into service on the Swiss side.  It has also faced breakdowns and staff shortages, as well as the coronavirus pandemic.  But from day one, some 25,000 passengers per day were using it. This peaked at 49,000 in February before the pandemic hit the network’s numbers.  Director Werren told RTS he is aiming for a return to normal next spring. He believes there is enormous potential for developing the rail network between France and the neighbouring Swiss cantons of Geneva and Vaud to serve the population in the whole Lake Geneva basin.   
2020-12-15;Switzerland budgets CHF28 billion for research and education  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-budgets-chf28-billion-for-research-and-education--/46225010;A total of CHF28.1 billion ($31.7 billion) will be invested in Swiss education, research and innovation over the next four years, parliament has confirmed.   The funds will mostly go towards universities and other institutes of higher education - as well as vocational training, which is the backbone of the Swiss education system, with two-thirds of school leavers opting for this route.    The CHF28.2 billion is CHF2 billion more than for the period 2017-2020. The government has previously stated that the aim is to ensure that Switzerland “remains an international leader in the field of education, research and innovation”.  During parliamentary debates there had been controversy over whether the Swiss 3R Competence CentreExternal link, that aims to implement the 3R principles (replace, reduce and refine) for animal experiments in academic research, should receive the bulk of CHF12 million in extra funding for research institutions of national importance. In the end, the proposal for additional funds was axed to ensure a speedy of approval of the budget.   Swiss spending on education remains relatively high. Statistics released earlier this year showed that the country spends considerably more than the European Union (EU) on education, the second-largest budget item: 16.5% of the total compared with 10.2% in the EU.   Currently Swiss universities are closed for on-site teaching, and have moved to distance learning, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Research activities - Swiss scientists are also active in coronavirus-related research - can continue but are subject to strict health guidelines. Schools remain open.  
2020-12-15;Coronavirus named ‘Sign of the Year’ by Swiss Deaf Society;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-named--sign-of-the-year--by-swiss-deaf-society/46225084;The Swiss Federation of the Deaf has designated ‘coronavirus’ as the sign of the year.   The choice was almost unanimous in our community, announced the organisation in a statement on Tuesday. The selection is an indication of both the dominance of the pandemic in current events and the ways in which sign languages have evolved over time, it said. The new sign first made its appearance this spring.  For once, the Swiss federation notes, this sign is basically the same in sign languages around the world despite some slight variations. The general idea is to represent the virus both in its form, the dot representing its nucleus and the fingers the peaks, and in its wide and rapid spread thanks to the gesture made by one hand around the fist of the other.  This is the fifth consecutive year that the Swiss Federation of the Deaf has designated the sign of the year. Past winners include Trump in 2016, Roger Federer in 2017, Federal Councilor Alain Berset in 2018 and Greta Thunberg in 2019.  Deaf communities around the world frequently create new signs so that sign language interpreters do not have to spell headline-making words using the traditional alphabet.  
2020-12-15;Government forecasts drop in GDP amid second coronavirus wave;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-forecasts-drop-in-gdp-amid-second-coronavirus-wave/46224742;The federal government’s Expert Group has forecasted a 3.3% decline in GDP for 2020.  On Tuesday, the Expert Group released its forecasts for the country’s GDP. It expects it to decline this fourth quarter but is optimistic that “no real slump in the Swiss economy will materialise”.   “Rising case numbers and the measures to combat the coronavirus will slow international economic development considerably in the winter half-year of 2020/2021, especially in Europe. In general, however, less dramatic containment measures have been taken than last spring and the overall economic impact is likely to be less severe,” said a government statement.  Despite the predictions of the worst decline since 1975, it is still much better than the 3.8% drop predicted in October. The Expert Group also forecasts the likely average annual unemployment rate will be 3.2%.  However, the outlook for 2021 is not looking as rosy as before. The experts predict that the spread of the coronavirus and associated restrictions will negatively affect the economy at the start of the year. They have revised their GDP growth forecast for 2021 downwards to 3% compared to 3.8% in October. The unemployment rate next year is expected to slightly increase to 3.3%.  The GDP growth of 3% in 2021 hinges on a gradual return to normal from spring 2021, after coronavirus vaccines become widely available.  “Under this condition, temporary above-average GDP growth would then be likely, as some delayed consumption expenditure and spending on investments would be made up and, in the course of the global economic recovery, exports of goods would pick up noticeably in particular,” said the government statement. 
2020-12-11;Swiss Guards get Swiss money for better barracks ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-guards-get-swiss-money-for-better-barracks-/46219194;The Swiss government has agreed funding to renovate the barracks of the Swiss Guard in the Vatican, which has been protecting the Pope since the sixteenth century.   In a press releaseExternal link, the government said it had agreed on Friday “to strengthen ties with the Swiss Guard External linkby providing CHF5 million ($5.6 million) in funding for the renovation of the barracks in the Vatican. The total cost of the project is CHF55 million”.  The barracks have only undergone partial renovations since their construction in the early 19th century and no longer meet current standards in terms of comfort or sustainability, according to the government. The renovations will also meet the needs of more personnel, since the number of guards is being increased from 110 to 135. This renovation work “will be entrusted to Swiss architectural and engineering firms”.  The decision comes as 2020 marks the centenary of the resumption of official relations between the Swiss Confederation and the Holy See.   “When relations broke down during the Kulturkampf between 1873 and 1920, the Swiss Guard continued to fulfil its mandate to protect the Pope and has thus connected Switzerland and the Vatican for over 500 years,” says the press release. “In addition to their ties through the Swiss Guard, Switzerland and the Vatican share the aim of promoting peace in the world through their bilateral relations.”  The “Kulturkampf” in Switzerland was a dispute between the state and the Catholic Church under Pope Pius IX. Switzerland has both majority-Protestant and majority Catholic cantons, although patterns of faith have changed in recent times.   “At home, the Swiss Guard enjoys widespread support among Swiss authorities and people regardless of faith community,” the government adds.    The guard has been suffering the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, more than a dozen Swiss Guards and one person who lives in the residence that houses the Pope tested positive for the coronavirus and had to be quarantined. The quarantine ended on November 21External link. 
2020-12-11;Do people still care about human rights?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/do-people-still-care-about-human-rights-/46218270;At a time of great distress caused by the coronavirus pandemic and other unprecedented global challenges, people are looking to human rights as a driver for hope, says United Nations special adviser Fabrizio HochschildExternal link. Seventy-five years ago, the UN was created to advance global peace and security, improve access to development and further respect for human rights. As people emerged from two world wars, as the full horrors of the Holocaust were exposed, as the shadow of the Cold War began to descend and as those living under the yoke of colonialism – nearly one-third of the world’s population then – fought to be free, respect for human rights was a global rallying cry. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 10 December 1948, inspired peoples across the world and laid the foundation for governance and institutional reforms, for progressive, people-centered legislation and education that reverberates from generation to generation. But for several years now, in some parts of the world respect for human rights has declined. The United Nations Secretary-General and High Commissioner for Human Rights have warned of a backlash – both at the country level and in discussions at the United Nations, notably in the fight against terrorism, with regard to women’s rights and in space for civil society participation and activism. The United Nations independent rights experts have raised the alarm over the steep increase in attacks, including murder, on human rights defenders, from environmental defenders to journalists. The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare deepened poverty, rising inequalities, structural and entrenched discrimination, and other widening gaps in the protection of social and economic rights.  In 2020, to mark its 75th anniversary, the United Nations set out to listen to the people it serves. It launched a global consultation to understand peoples’ hopes and fears for the future, and to seek to better understand expectations of international cooperation and of the UN in particular. About 1.5 million people participated in our consultations directly, through surveys and dialogues in all UN member and observer states. Many more did so through our partners on the ground, from large youth movements to business people and indigenous groups. We also asked Edelman Intelligence and the Pew Research Center to carry out independent, representative polling of 50,000 people in 50 countries – to serve as a reality check and ensure we were not just hearing from those sympathetic to us. In the midst of a pandemic, with poverty on the rise, conflicts unresolved and climate change unchecked, we were uncertain as to whether furthering respect for human rights would feature at all, let alone as a priority for the global public. But it did. Of the issues cited as priorities for recovering from the pandemic, all have human rights at their core, from securing better access to basic services to improving how we address inequalities. Meanwhile, the most common proposals for solutions centered on increasing people’s participation in decisions that affect their lives, and on increasing the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups. In the longer term, next to combatting climate change and environmental destruction, respondents main priorities all reflect an aspiration for more universal respect for human rights.  The call for universal respect for human rights and human dignity unified humanity after the second World War. And it does so again today. At a time of great distress and unprecedented global challenges, people look to human rights as a driver for hope and just measure for decisive action to realize the future we want. We need to heed the call. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.
2020-12-11;First Swiss canton starts mass coronavirus testing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/first-swiss-canton-starts-mass-coronavirus-testing/46218262;Canton Graubünden has started targeted mass testing of residents as part of its measures to shore up the ski season. This is a Swiss-wide first. The first tests started in the south of the mountainous canton on Friday. By the morning some 9,500 people had already registered for the voluntary rapid test, which is free of charge, the cantonal authorities said. The aim is to have tested 20,000 people by Sunday. “The health department underscores that testing is an important way to detect as many new coronavirus infections as possible,” the canton said in a statementExternal link. The regions being tested are Maloja (tourism region), Bernina (high number of cases) and Engiadina Bassa/Val Müstair. This is a population of around 35,000, including tourists. In addition, 100 young people and 50 teachers at a secondary school in Bonaduz, higher up the canton, have also been tested. This was because of an increase in Covid-19 infections, despite ten days of distance learning. Tests showed that only one person had been infected. Due to the willingness of people to be tested, the authorities were able to discount the idea that there were many asymptomatic virus carriers at the school. Graubünden’s pilot project in the south of the canton is taking place December 11-13. Based on how this goes, and if needed, mass testing could be extended to the entire canton in southeast Switzerland, officials have said. “We want to massively increase testing capacity. We are doing a pilot project for Switzerland,” said cantonal government member Peter Peyer, when announcing the measures on December 4. The mountainous canton counts St Moritz, Klosters, Arosa and Davos among its resorts. Davos is also the traditional base for the World Economic Forum – although not next year, as it has moved to Singapore over Covid-19 concerns. Cantonal authorities said the aim of mass testing is to contain the spread of the pandemic, to save the winter season, particularly for strong tourism and ski regions, and allow people to celebrate the holidays together.
2020-12-11;Emergency vaccine approval not legal option in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/emergency-vaccine-approval-not-legal-option-in-switzerland/46217840;The emergency approval process being used by some countries to speed up the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines is not a legal option in Switzerland, its medicines approval agency said on Friday. The statement comes as the regulatory authority in the United States, the FDA, gets ready to decide on an emergency approval (Emergency Use Authorisation) for the use of the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech.  “Swissmedic works closely with international partner authorities and reviews all applications for Covid-19 vaccines as a matter of urgency and in a 'rolling' procedure,” the Swiss agency for therapeutic products said in a statement on FridayExternal link. Swissmedic said it had received additional details from companies on their Covid-19 vaccines that would enable it to issue authorisations quickly once sufficient data on safety, efficacy and quality were available. However, it added: “An emergency approval for vaccines is not a legal option in Switzerland,” the agency said, ruling out what it called “premature vaccinations” for the country. “The safety of the Swiss population has top priority,” the statement said. Britain became the first country to approve and roll out a Covid-19 19 vaccine from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. The first vaccination took place on December 8. Switzerland said on December 7 that it had signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech to deliver 3 million doses of their vaccine. It has also signed agreements with Moderna and AstraZeneca. The Alpine country now has 15.8 million doses of vaccines on order from the three different manufacturers, pending approval from the health regulator.

The Swiss politician placed ahead of Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen (75), Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin (85) and pop icon Beyoncé (72), but well behind German chancellor Angela Merkel, who topped the list. Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and US vice-president elect Kamala Harris rounded out the top three. The American business magazine applied four metrics – money, impact, spheres of influence and media mentions – to determine the 17th edition of the ranking. It also considered how the women responded to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Swiss president has been highly visible as part of the government’s efforts to manage the health crisis, listening to and reassuring the population, Swiss public television RTS pointed out. Other women leaders who have been praised for their handling of the pandemic also appeared on the list, including New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern (32) and Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen (37). Sommaruga has been a member of the government’s executive body, the Federal Council, since 2010. She last held the Swiss rotating presidency in 2015. The veteran politician will hand the position over to economics minister Guy Parmelin in 2021.
2020-12-10;Schools and training: lessons learned from Covid lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/schools-and-training--lessons-learned-from-covid-lockdown/46215460;"Teachers and pupils at schools and in vocational training faced a massive digital learning curve during the spring coronavirus lockdown in Switzerland, two studies have found. Some learners missed out. Although digital learning was not new in vocational schools, the abrupt move to online tools and teaching during the lockdown lead to “a huge extra effort didactically and time-wise”, a Swiss-wide surveyExternal link of these schools published on Thursday found. Under Switzerland’s dual-track apprenticeship systemExternal link, young people combine on-the-job training with lessons in a vocational school during their apprenticeships. It is by far the most popular option after post-obligatory school, with two-thirds of school leavers (aged 15-16 plus) taking this route. Apprentices, along with school pupils, faced school – and company – closures from mid-March as the country went into national lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic. This meant a quick move into online learning. Whereas obligatory schools went back on May 11, many vocational schools continued remote lessons until the summer. Currently, schools and vocational schools are open, although under strict measures, including masks for older pupils. Vocational teachers said that the lack of personal interaction and learning support for pupils was problematic during the first wave lockdown. “Teachers added that students learned less during online teaching,” the Swiss Federal Institute of Vocational Education and Training (SFIVETExternal link) report said. This was the view of 50-60% of respondents. In some cases, they felt pupils had learned significantly less. However, many teachers surveyed for the study said they considered the lockdown experience a “chance”. “They would like to further develop and improve their teaching with digital tools, also for the time after the pandemic,” the report noted. Meanwhile, an ongoing survey by the University of Zurich (UZH) of 299 school heads in German-speaking Switzerland found that a third reported no experience at all of digital learning before the lockdown. The pandemic gave schools a push: 80% began to use online platforms for teaching, communicating or learning materials – between pupils, parents and teachers - during this time. “Stronger concepts for effective digital lessons should be developed, especially for primary schools, to ensure that that this digitalisation boost doesn’t fizzle out,” education professor Katharina Maag Merki said in a UZH statementExternal link on Wednesday. Primary schools (nine out of ten) in particular found lockdown stressful; compared to three-quarters of secondary schools. Schools said it was especially challenging to motivate and emotionally support their pupils, plus give support to children who were not able to learn well at home (this, as other surveys have pointed out, can be for various reasons: such as lack of parental support or a quiet place to learn). This was particularly the case for primary schools with a high percentage of pupils in this situation. These schools need extra support, the study concluded."
2020-12-10;Swiss day of action urges people to seek help amid Covid-19 stress;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-day-of-action-urges-people-to-seek-help-amid-covid-19-stress/46213244;The Swiss government has launched a nationwide awareness campaign to encourage people to seek support as the pandemic and restrictions take a toll on mental health. The government announced that December 10 is “Talk about it. Seek helpExternal link.” day, an effort designed to help boost people’s mental and emotional wellbeing as the pandemic’s second wave continues to impact Switzerland. “The day of action will also educate people about the importance of being attentive to people around them and offering help,” said the statement announcing the campaign. The government, along with partners at various charities and awareness organisations, is encouraging the public to “break the taboo” on mental health and talk to friends, family or experts about how they are feeling. As part of the campaign, mental health experts and organisations are offering strategies and advice on how to deal with and support others with anxiety and other emotional stress during this time. A survey by the public health office at the end of October, found that some 15% of the population felt either very bad or bad due to the coronavirus situation. Financial worries, family conflicts and feelings of loneliness have increased while at the same time, some proven coping strategies such as hanging out with friends aren’t possible, acknowledges the government. SWI swissinfo.ch readers recently shared some of their emotional ups and downs during coronavirus, and weighed in on how they have seen the pandemic impacting mental health. On our German-language site, one reader wrote that the “collateral damage to the heart and soul will be immense. With children I see compulsions, fears in the future - it will take decades before it is ‘good’ again - if it can happen at all.” The reader expressed concern about the effects of 10 months of social distancing, masks, and time spent inside. The uncertainty and hysteria associated with political measures to address the pandemic also weigh on the public psyche, the reader writes.  One reader in English wrote of stress due to inability to work and that someone in their family had to spend many days in the army, which provided support to cantons during coronavirus. The commenter, who appears to be from abroad, also added that they’ve started to feel less welcome in Switzerland. Since the start of the pandemic, a reader on our Arabic site wrote that he or she has been almost confined to their apartment, “leaving it only when absolutely necessary, and seeking the help of a psychiatrist does not help, as the doctor suffers like others”.  A reader living in Argentina wrote in Spanish that “we have all gone through some days of emotional ups and downs, depending on the news that reached us or the over-information so contradictory and, sometimes, unreliable to which we are exposed in these times”. The reader added that children also suffered from the lack of face-to-face schooling. Some readers were also able to find bright spots and comfort in spending more time at home with close family. One contributor wrote that the family is a lot more relaxed since working from home. “Having a lot more time together because of work from home made us decide not to go back to having the second job.” The reader added that the pandemic prompted a move to a smaller village, which is cheaper and will allow them to spend more time with grandparents. The reader in Argentina found some coping strategies: “hobbies and physical or motivational activities helped us to cope with the uncertainty, the fear of the unknown and that feeling of insecurity so present in these times”. Another reader commented in German on how the coronavirus period “can make us aware of our strengths, that we can do without, stand together. It enables us to have the experience of not having to want too much, needing to be less loud and fast, [this] has relaxing qualities”. On Facebook, a French-speaking reader wrote that his mental health is very good and “he laughs as much has possible during the day”. 
2020-12-09;How to make the Federal Council more weatherproof;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-to-make-the-federal-council-more-weatherproof/46208704;"The seven-person Federal Council (Swiss government) is a truly Swiss invention, but it has been scarcely researched in the field of political science. A book by political scientist Adrian Vatter makes up for that – and points out where there is room for improvement. Classic teaching on systems of government takes a straightforward approach. There are parliamentary systems where the people elect the parliament, like in the United Kingdom. The parliamentary majority determines the government, and it can also topple it, just as the government can also dissolve parliament. Then there are presidential systems, like in the United States. Parliament and the government are elected in separate votes, so each has its own authority with mutual checks and balances. But these categories don’t encompass the full range of systems of government that exist today – among them, the Swiss system. Here, the government is elected by parliament, but for a fixed term of four years. The same as the term for parliamentarians. There is no mechanism for the dismissal of either authority by the other. The fathers of the Swiss constitution of 1848 were unable to push through popular elections to choose the government. Nor did any of the three attempts to entrust the people with the election of the Federal Council muster a national majority. So a genuine Swiss invention dating from 1848 remains essentially unchanged to this day. Adrian VatterExternal link, who has just presented the first comprehensive work by a political scientist on the federal government, calls it a “hybrid system of government” in his latest book Der Bundesrat. Eine Schweizer RegierungExternal link (The Federal Council. A Swiss Government). The government is based on the principle of a cooperative executive that is elected by parliament. In its work, however, the government is largely autonomous. Both authorities are kept in check by referendums, so directly by the people, who can correct their course when necessary. This system of government was established in the 19th century. The French founded the first collective government in the Helvetic Republic era – first with five, then with seven so-called directors. The founders of the Swiss federal state adopted this model when they created the Federal Council. They went back and forth over the number of members, but finally settled on seven. Three were reserved for the former urban areas of Zurich, Bern and Vaud. The other cantons together had a majority with a total of four seats, but they had no individual rights to permanent representation. The only sacred rule observed through the ages was a fair distribution by language area. Informal rules on the make-up of the government, such as origin by language area and party, exist to this day. The government was structured according to two principles from the beginning. The members of the national government are part of a cooperative, but also head a department, a branch of the administration. In the cooperative they decide together; in the department, they make their own decisions. The more a member of the government focuses on the second, the sooner he or she loses the overview, Vatter says. The political analyst describes this as the first dilemma facing our government. But the author also identifies two more dilemmas: No. 2: Each member of the government is simultaneously part of a government and part of his or her party. This was not envisaged in the 19th century, because at that time no national parties existed yet. So the modern Radical-Liberal Party, Christian Democratic Party, Swiss People’s Party and the Conservative Democratic Party had “representatives” in the national government before they officially existed on a national level. It was only the other way round for the Social Democrats, who were in opposition for a long time to start with. And finally the third dilemma: The government’s integration into the network of associations, interest groups and lobbyists. According to Vatter, these connections have become much more intensive over the past 30 years. Growing expectations among special interest groups, however, make it more difficult to pursue higher aims, the author says. Vatter sees all three dilemmas as structural problems for the Swiss government. Nominated by parties, elected by parliament, influenced by pressure groups, and held in check by voters: this is one possible way to sum up the Swiss system of government. Vatter’s study is interesting, because alongside the history and functioning of government, it also lists proposals for reform. His starting point is the array of ideas that have emerged since the crisis-ridden 1970s. The only one of these to be implemented was the small “Reform of State Leadership” at the beginning of the 21st century. This imposed a maximum of ten state secretariats and strengthened the general secretaries of departments. It means that each member of the government can create his own small cabinet with connections to parties, associations and the media. Vatter is sure that this reform doesn’t go far enough in view of broad trends such as internationalisation, Europeanisation and the increasing importance of the media and personal profiles, but also on account of a new polarisation of the party landscape and business and society. He observes that the government muddles through very effectively in good times, but is lacking in ideas for tough times. European policy since 1992 illustrates this perfectly, but so does the coronavirus crisis in 2020. The author therefore suggests three further measures to reform the government. None of them are new in themselves. But the combination is the result of the most comprehensive evaluation so far. These reforms are: With these, the Bern professor has suggested three significant improvements to the status quo. The concordance contract should improve political strategy in relation to content. The presidential department should strengthen leadership. Selection by list should guarantee a homogenous composition of government members. This would change the Swiss system of government, Vatter says. It would bring it close to the parliamentary system, without going that far. It would stay on its current course, because government policy would still be determined by referendums. But the structure of the government, the author hopes, would be more streamlined. And that is the obvious weakness of the status quo in Switzerland: the system resists resolute, cohesive governance. Der Bundesrat. Eine Schweizer Regierung (The Federal Council.

This Alpine country now has 15.8 million doses of vaccines on order from three different manufacturers, pending approval from the health regulator. The Swiss government increased its previous order with the US biotechnology company for its mRNA vaccine to a new total of 7.5 million doses, it was announced on Tuesday. Earlier this week, Switzerland added a vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech to its desired stockpile list. Switzerland’s membership of the World Health Organization COVAXExternal link initiative would also grant access to enough vaccines to cover 20% of the Swiss population. Health regulator Swissmedic is currently evaluating the safety of several vaccine candidates under its “rolling procedure”, which allows manufacturers to submit the results of test studies in stages. So far, no vaccine has yet been approved. On Wednesday, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said it had reached an agreement with Moderna to extend the use of its Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S diagnostic tool to speed up testing of its vaccine. “To enhance our understanding of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 there would be a benefit in knowing the starting levels of antibodies a person has, prior to vaccination, in order to evaluate any change in antibody levels that the vaccine induces,” Roche stated in a press release. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S diagnostic tool was granted emergency use authorisation by the US health authorities last month. 
2020-12-08;Grim Covid milestone sparks emotional outpouring in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/grim-covid-milestone-sparks-emotional-outpouring-in-switzerland/46211228;Switzerland now has surpassed the tragic milestone of 5,000 Covid deaths. This has caused a wave of emotions across the country, including anger, especially in the press and on social media. Thousands of candles in memory of the victims of the virus have been lit on Federal Square, in the Swiss capital Bern, regularly since mid-November, in a private initiative. Since last weekend candles can also be seen virtually, thanks to the Swiss media giant Tamedia. The Tages-Anzeiger, Basler- and Berner Zeitung, Bund, 24 Heures, Tribune de Genève all have 60 pages of candles onlineExternal link – red for women, blue for men – on their websites. Most candles remain anonymous, but sometimes there’s a name and an age or a quote from a death notice, perhaps a small note from a relative. Tamedia editorial staff said that they wanted to show “the true story behind the numbers”. “Sometimes we feel like we are on another planet,” they wrote. “While politicians and tourism experts fight in public about how many people should go in gondolas in ski areas, people are telling us how they said goodbye forever on the telephone…” Without candles, the online independent magazine Republik has also been decrying the gap between the epidemiological situation, individual suffering and the preoccupations of the authorities. “The government announces minimalist measures against Covid, but the ski resorts get their Christmas business. Just what are the values that remain non-negotiable in Switzerland?” asked the journalist Daniel Binswanger. Shocked that a country that is registering 500 deaths a week believes skiing is the only “national emergency”, Republik also expressed its dismay over celebrations that took place mid-session in the Swiss parliament. At the beginning of November parliamentarians marked in succession both the new Senate president and cabinet minister Ueli Maurer's birthday with music, singing and limited mask-wearing, which provoked an avalanche of strong reactions – poking fun and outrage - on social media. Binswanger described it as “obscene”. “This total lack of shame is an instrument of power that Donald Trump has taken to a new level of perfection. And in Switzerland too health policy has also reached a phase of obscenity,” concluded the editorial. The tabloid Blick was also shocked and reminded readers what had been signed off in that very same building: “wearing masks, social distancing, no sports training, no choir practice, no birthdays, no bars, no clubs, no parties: 2020 is a year of doing without and solidarity.” Under these conditions, the newspaper said, politicians should at the very least “conform strictly to the rules that they have imposed on everyone else”. And in the spirit of Christmas as “the celebration of love thy neighbour” which this year means “a voluntary renouncing”. The health situation and especially the war over ski resorts has attracted a lot of international press interest as well. In Germany, Austria, Italy and France, the media have reported on Bern’s decision to keep resorts open despite opposing decisions from Paris, Rome and Berlin. Often the reporting is purely factual but there are a few underlying clichés of a selfish Switzerland that is taking advantage of the situation. “Could it be Switzerland, which is geographically in the middle of warring EU countries, but which is not linked by their agreements, that in the end will have the last laugh?” asked Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine. Radio France Culture was more direct, given that the French have been forbidden from coming to ski in Switzerland, saying: “For decades Switzerland has been welcoming fraudsters – where it was once tax fraudsters, now its ski fraudsters.” For its part, French magazine Le Point reminded readers of the case of the Ischgl ski resort in Austria, where 10,000 European tourists are said to have been infected with the virus at the beginning of the pandemic. “If such a catastrophe happened at Zermatt, Gstaad, Davos or Verbier, there would be long-lasting damage to Switzerland’s image, it said. French daily Le Figaro was among those who had harsh words for how the second wave was developing. “Excessive optimism, an inefficient strategy, overwhelmed cantons and a passive Swiss government. This is how Switzerland has changed from good pupil to wearing the dunce’s cap in the fight against the coronavirus,” it wrote. But some saw positive aspects. The 5,500 victims since March was certainly two or three times more than in Austria or Germany in terms of population, but a lot less than Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States and France. This led German tabloid Bild, for example, to ask if there had been a “corona miracle of Bern” because the country was “going through a second wave without a lockdown”. It was even “managing a turnaround”, as the Austrian daily Kurier put it. There was a positive verdict from Britain’s The Telegraph and the American New York Post, which highlighted the flattening of the curve since the end of November and the virtues of federalism. “Instead of implementing a nationwide lockdown, the Swiss government has largely left restrictions up to individual regions [cantons] to decide,” the outlets reported. This “Swiss special way” had worked, they said. This is a view that is close to that of Switzerland’s own Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper, which is also convinced of the virtues of federalism. “But this approach only works when the cantons take their responsibility onboard,” it said.
2020-12-08;European countries give backing for more night-train services;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/european-countries-give-backing-for-more-night-train-services/46211130;Switzerland, Austria, France and Germany have pledged to increase cooperation on large-scale cross-border and night-train networks over the next four years. In a memorandum of understanding signed by transport ministers on Tuesday, the countries said they would build on the “Trans-Europe-Express” project, spearheaded at the European level by Germany. The projects foresee a rejuvenation of the trans-continental network first elaborated between the 1950s and the 1980s. The cooperation will this time be guided by environmental concerns, under the motto “train before plane”. “By increasing the number of night trains and major routes, we are also contributing to climate protection goals,” said Peter Füglistaler, head of the Swiss Federal Transport Office, who represented Transport Minister Simonetta Sommaruga at the meeting. From December 2021, night trains should be up and running on the Vienna-Munich-Paris and Zurich-Cologne-Amsterdam routes, Reuters reports. By 2023, connections from Vienna and Berlin to Brussels and Paris will follow, and by the end of 2024 it should be possible to travel overnight from Zurich to Barcelona. Tuesday’s declaration of intent widens the cooperation which Switzerland had planned with Austria’s ÖBB rail network, announced in September. Until the coronavirus arrived at the beginning of 2020, demand for night-trains was rising steadily, according to the Swiss Federal Railways. Its CEO Vincent Ducrot said on Tuesday that this demand – based on “respect for the climate and the economisation of resources” – would continue to increase after the pandemic has been overcome. The dismantling of the Swiss sleeper network began 15 years ago, and since then more and more direct overnight routes have disappeared. Previous destinations such as Brussels, Rome, Barcelona, Moscow and Copenhagen are no longer on the timetable. In 2009 Swiss Federal Railways ended its night-train service with its own sleepers and German Railways did the same in 2016. Austrian Federal Railways took over some of the routes.
2020-12-08;Pandemic dominates Swiss Words of the Year;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-dominates-swiss-words-of-the-year/46210382;Covid-19 is leaving its mark not only on Swiss society but also on the country’s four national languages. The Swiss Words of the Year for 2020 are all connected to the coronavirus and its effects. “New virus, new situation, new words,” said the jury. “Covidiots, coronasceptics and countless other neologisms have sprung up throughout the year, reminding us of the creativity of language and the human spirit in difficult times.” Systemrelevant (systemically relevant) is the Word of the Year in German-speaking Switzerland, followed by Maskensünder (mask sinner) and stosslüften (to vigorously ventilate a room). The Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) revealed the winners in a statementExternal link on Tuesday. Researchers at the institute used Switzerland’s largest text database and the judgement of a multilingual jury to pick the winners. The government ruffled feathers in spring when it classified which sectors were indispensable and systemrelevant for the well-being of society and the functioning of the economy. “People were left asking themselves: Are we not all relevant to the system?” said the jury. At the beginning of the year many Swiss were also still raising an eyebrow at masked Asian tourists, for whom wearing facemasks has been normal for years. As 2020 draws to a close, it’s the Swiss without a mask who attract attention – and fines. These Maskensünder refuse to cover up for a range of ideological reasons, but the police aren’t listening. Until now, opening the windows completely for a few minutes and having a good Stosslüften – as opposed to having a window cracked all the time – has been a recommended way of keeping heating costs down in winter. However, Covid-19 has highlighted another benefit of doing this in homes, classrooms and offices: reducing the risk of infection. The trend continued in the French-speaking part of the country, with coronagraben (corona divide) beating gestes barrières (barrier gestures) and luttes (struggles). Coronagraben, a twist on the linguistic Röstigraben, “highlights both the disagreements between the German- and French-speaking cantons regarding the health measures to be taken or ignored and the wide variations in the number of cases according to language region,” the jury said. “Above all, it shows that we have all experienced a different reality depending on our language region.” “Mask, hydroalcoholic gel, washing hands for 30 seconds, greeting one other with feet, ventilating enclosed spaces, avoiding crowds... 2020 has profoundly changed our behaviour, to the point that some people have already integrated their gestes barrières into their dreams – while others are shocked to see film characters kissing and holding hands,” the jury said. “If these barrier gestures have become part of our habits for good, their name highlights the uncomfortable paradox that permeates society in 2020: a barrier to get in touch, a gesture that distances us to allow us to get closer.” The ZHAW researchers said the fight against Covid-19 this year appears to have “crushed, relegated and nullified” all the other struggles – “and yet they have not stopped”. They pointed to the fight for the climate, for feminism, and against racism with the Black Lives Matter movement, “examples of causes that have pushed many citizens to risk their health in order to demonstrate and act”, they said. “More than ever, the awareness of an imperfect world and the desire for change have marked 2020 in Switzerland.” The pandemic was literally Word of the Year in Italian-speaking canton Ticino, with pandemia being chosen ahead of responsibilità (responsibility) and distanza (distance). “Responsibility saves lives. Make the right decision and stay at home,” the Ticinese authorities urged citizens. The ZHAW jury noted that responsibility recently appeared in the Responsible Business Initiative, this time calling on companies to do the right thing. In Romansh, a Swiss national language spoken by about 60,000 people, the jury selected mascrina (mask), extraordinari (extraordinary) and positivitad (positivity).
2020-12-07;Avalanche claims skier’s life in central Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/avalanche-claims-skier-s-life-in-central-switzerland/46209270;A skier has died in central Switzerland after being caught up in an avalanche. The accident comes a day after the authorities had issued elevated avalanche warnings for some areas of the country, following heavy snowfall. The 23-year-old victim died on the scene near the Titlis mountain, despite being found by rescue workers and receiving resuscitation treatment. Two other skiers, out of a party of five, were also hit by the avalanche but managed to free themselves without serious injury. The group was skiing off-piste when the avalanche struck at around 10.15am. An investigation into what triggered the avalanche is ongoing. Heavy snowfall over the weekend - up to 60cms in some areas on Sunday - has disrupted rail and road traffic in southern and southeastern Switzerland.   According to SRF Meteo – the Swiss public broadcaster’s weather service - there is an elevated avalanche threat throughout northern Ticino, including Centovalli, and in the southern valleys of Graubünden and the Upper Engadine. In these regions, it’s a Level 4 on the five-part danger scale. From the southern Valais to the eastern Bernese Oberland to Alpstein and in the remaining areas of Graubünden, it’s danger Level 3, reported SRF Meteo on Sunday. Unlike many other countries in Europe, Switzerland has decided to open its ski resorts during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Five people were killed by avalanches in Switzerland last season, a number that was significantly lower than the average 18 deaths per year in recent winters. It was the lowest number of avalanche deaths in 60 years.
2020-12-07;WEF annual meeting moves from Switzerland to Singapore;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wef-annual-meeting-moves-from-switzerland-to-singapore/46209082;The coronavirus pandemic has forced the World Economic Forum (WEF) to relocate its flagship event to Singapore next year. It will be only the second time in 50 years that it will be staged outside of the Swiss mountain resort of Davos. The 51st annual meeting of business, political and civil society leaders will take place in Singapore between May 13-16, WEF announced on Monday. Organisers added that it plans to return to Davos in 2022. The event has moved out of Switzerland in stages. Having been advised not to hold the meeting in Davos on its traditional January date, organisers looked for another venue in Switzerland for next summer. The pandemic had also forced a slimmed-down, half virtual meeting next year, it had been previously announced. But now it has been forced to move out of Switzerland altogether. “The change in location reflects the Forum’s priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community. After careful consideration, and in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases, it was decided that Singapore was best placed to hold the meeting,” read a WEF statement on Monday. A separate virtual event, called “The Davos Agenda”, has also been scheduled for January 25-29, the original date set for the annual meeting. It will aim to “rebuild trust and shape the principles, policies and partnerships needed for 2021”. The only other time that WEF has staged its annual meeting outside of Switzerland was in 2002. That year it was held in New York out of solidarity for the city struck by the 9/11 terrorist attack months earlier. Last week, Swiss parliamentarians wrote to Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, warning of hundreds of job losses if WEF was not held in Switzerland. The flagship WEF event contributes tens of millions of francs each year to both Davos and the Swiss economy as a whole. Many hotels and restaurants rely on the annual influx of wealthy participants for a large slice of their income.
2020-12-07;Tackling pandemic threats proactively;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/tackling-pandemic-threats-proactively/46206166;"If we are to minimise the impact of future disease outbreaks, we must recognise the importance of immunisation and invest in preemptive vaccine development, writes Tim Keys, a researcher at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich. The marathon of Covid-​19 vaccine development has reached the final sprint. Two leading vaccines have proven to protect 95% of vaccinated people from the disease. For the first time we can be confident that vaccines will put an end to this pandemic. However, emerging infectious diseases will continue to threaten us in the future. The question now is: how can we avoid the next pandemic? Whereas the Covid-​19 pandemic is likely to be brought under control within a few years, diseases such as measles, polio and smallpox plagued human societies over centuries. It is only in the past few decades that vaccines have reduced, and even eliminated, the enormous burden of death and disability caused by these diseases. An unfortunate side-​effect of this success is reduced public awareness of the danger posed by infectious diseases.  The current pandemic is a tough reminder that modern society remains vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. Given that many long-​known pathogens are now vaccine-​preventable, the challenge in coming decades is to develop vaccines that protect us against future disease threats.  Time and again, diseases jump from animals to humans. Covid-​19 is the third serious spillover of a coronavirus from bats into humans in the past 20 years, it follows SARS-​1 in 2003 and the emergence of MERS in 2012. Wild and domestic animal populations provide an enormous reservoir where pathogens circulate and evolve new mechanisms to infect and spread to new hosts, including humans. It is not possible to prevent the emergence of pathogens into the human population, but good preparation will allow us to contain most outbreaks before they develop to epidemic or even pandemic levels. Epidemic preparedness includes three essential activities: first, identify emerging infectious diseases (surveillance and monitoring); second, study these pathogens and third, preemptive vaccine development. Mostly we fail at this third point, and there are good reasons for this: the development of a vaccine from the initial design through to completion of clinical trials may take upwards of a decade and cost over $500 million (CHF445 million). The risk of failure is high. Finally, when an effective vaccine is developed, it has little chance of commercial success because a relatively small number of doses will be sufficient to end an outbreak. The unfortunate result is that these projects are rarely brought to completion. A tragic example is the Ebola vaccine. Despite more than 10 years of development, the vaccine was not ready for deployment until a year into the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. A total of 11,000 people died in that outbreak and we now know that the vaccine provides 100% protection against the disease. Similarly, in the case of SARS-​1, the financial incentives to develop a vaccine dried up after public health measures brought that outbreak under control. Laboratory studies published in April this year indicated that a SARS-​1 vaccine could have provided some protection against Covid-​19 infection1. If development had continued, a SARS-​1 vaccine would have been tested in the early stages of the Covid-​19 outbreak and may have halted the course of this pandemic. On the other hand, preparedness efforts directed at MERS have dramatically shortened the timeline to produce a Covid-​19 vaccine. It took years of basic and applied research for scientists to learn how to produce a good vaccine candidate targeting MERS. Importantly, several MERS vaccine projects were supported with long-​term funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership of public, private and philanthropic organizations. Fortunately, the strategies developed for MERS allowed vaccine developers to immediately produce promising Covid-​19 candidates2. It is hard to overestimate the impact of MERS vaccine research on our current situation. Without this prior work, it might have taken years to develop an effictive Covid-​19 vaccine.  The CEPI consortium aims to fund the development of at least one candidate vaccine for each of the emerging infectious diseases on the WHO “priority” list, and to stockpile doses for immediate efficacy testing in the event of an outbreak. The consortium estimates the cost of this to be $4 billion3. This figure seems large, but it is tiny compared to the estimated $10 trillion that the Covid-​19 pandemic is expected to cost the global economy4 – not to mention the human suffering. If we are to minimize the consequences of future outbreaks, it is essential that society understands the true value of vaccines and governments invest in preemptive vaccine development.

2020-12-07;Covid continues to stress Swiss economy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-continues-to-stress-swiss-economy/46208674;Overnight hotel stays fell by more than 40% during the summer as Switzerland locked down against coronavirus. The pandemic has also battered the finances of the airline industry, but most smaller companies have retained some optimism for the future. Official statistics revealed on Monday that Swiss hotels had 9.3 million fewer overnight stays between May and October than for the same period in 2019. While more people living in Switzerland booked into hotels, the number of foreign guests fell by three quarters. Overnight stays have been put at 10.2 million for the summer months. Last week Zurich airport said it was losing CHF1 million ($1.1 million) a day as passenger numbers fell to a trickle. Despite the dire situation, the airport last month went ahead with opening its flagship ‘Circle’ conferencing, leisure and retail centre, which had been many years in the planning. Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) says it is losing up to CHF2 million a day as quarantine restrictions throughout the world continue to put people off flying. SWISS CEO Thomas Klühr says future prospects will only look up when vaccines start to roll out among populations. But not all companies are facing such difficulties. Nearly 60% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Switzerland are holding out hopes for improved conditions, according to a recent survey. This makes Swiss firms among the most positive in Europe, according to the joint study by Facebook, the World Bank and the OECD. A quarter of Swiss SMEs surveyed said they were able to generate at least half of their income through digital channels. This puts Switzerland in the middle field of digital sales success in Europe. Smaller companies in Ireland and Britain have the most efficient means of raising income through digitisation, the report concludes. However, 54% of all companies surveyed by the ‘Global State of Small Business ReportExternal link’ worldwide said sales were significantly down so far this year. The number of bankruptcies in Switzerland is a fifth lower than normal, according to Creditreform, the Swiss association of creditors. But this is only as a result of emergency credit guarantees and deferrals on companies’ social security payments that has helped them through the early stages of the pandemic.
2020-12-07;Swiss rank among top ten FT European business schools;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-rank-among-top-ten-ft-european-business-schools/46208000;Two Swiss institutions – the University of St Gallen and the IMD in Lausanne - are among the ten best European business schools, according to the Financial Times. The University of St Gallen (HSG)External link was ranked seventh and the Institute for Management Development (IMD)External link was placed tenth in the 2020 listExternal link, which was published by the international business newspaper on Sunday. The list was topped by HEC Paris in France – the country was the dominant one in the list with Insead in third place. The London Business School came second. “We can also be proud to be once again the best-placed public university in this Financial Times evaluation,” HSG President Professor Bernhard Ehrenzeller said in a HSG statement on MondayExternal link. This is the eighth time in a row that the HSG has been in the top ten (4th in 2019). The IMD improved on its 11th place on the list in 2019. David Bach, Dean of Innovation and Programs at IMD, said the institution was the most distinctive among the top business schools with comparatively small degree programmes but a substantial executive education portfolio. “And yet we hold our own vis-à-vis our much larger peers, which is immensely gratifying and a reminder that clarity of purpose is critical for success,” he told swissinfo.ch in emailed comments. The European Business School RankingExternal link consolidates four individual rankings published by the FT over the year. In the European individual rankings, the HSG 2020 came first with its Master in Strategy and International Management (for the tenth time in a row, also worldwide). The FT singled outExternal link the “impressive weighted average salary three years after graduation” at $113,175 (CHF101,214), the highest rank for gender equality i.e. one female student for every male, and the international diversity of the business school, with 96% of students from abroad. The IMD topped the open-enrolment executive education in Europe listing (as it has for the global equivalent ranking since 2012). The FT says that competition is fierce in this category, but that the independent institution scored highly for its “highly rated teaching methods, faculty and facilities” and did well in the “aims achieved” category which looks at how much participants’ course expectations were met. In its analysis of the 2020 results, the FT said institutions across Europe were capitalising on high international demand. They had faced much upheaval due to Brexit and its implications for cross-border research but also from the Covid-19 pandemic since spring. But many business schools were able to develop new teaching methods and attract new students, said the FT. Higher education institutions across Switzerland are currently on distance learning due to the second coronavirus wave. They were also in lockdown over spring. “Almost everything we have done since March has involved technology, from creating hybrid classrooms for our MBAs and EMBAs to delivering fully technology-enabled, highly-interactive programmes for dozens of clients and thousands of learners,” the IMD’s Bach said. “This has opened up vast opportunities to make learning more impactful, enabling us to more effectively serve clients around the world from our base in Switzerland. Covid-19 has transformed executive learning, by and large that is a good thing, and IMD is at the forefront of change. 
2020-12-07;Covid pandemic fans flames of anti-Semitism in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-pandemic-fans-flames-of-anti-semitism-in-switzerland/46207896;Jewish people in Switzerland are concerned about increasing anti-Semitism during the Covid-19 pandemic, says the Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism. It wants to combat this with education and dialogue. When people are insecure, even ancient conspiracy theories return to the surface, Dina Wyler, the Zurich-based foundation’s managing director, said in an interviewExternal link with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung on Monday. A scapegoat helps people deal with a feeling of powerlessness, she said. “Unfortunately, this scapegoat is often Jewish.” This goes back to old, deeply rooted ideas that come to the fore in a crisis, Wyler said. “Anti-Semitism never went away. But it became less socially acceptable.” Now the boundaries of what one can say have shifted, she said. Jewish people in Switzerland perceive anti-Semitism as a major problem, with most reports to the foundation involving damage to property and insulting statements, she said. “Physical violence such as that in Germany is very rare in Switzerland.” Wyler is calling for dialogue, education and clear responses to anti-Semitism. “When people with yellow Jewish badges appeared at anti-coronavirus rallies in Zurich, Basel and Lachen in recent weeks, the other demonstrators should have reacted. They should have made it clear that comparing state-orchestrated genocide to restaurant closures and people wearing masks is going too far,” she said. Politicians, too, must do their part and set a good example, she said. The foundation has set up a website, stopantisemitismus.chExternal link, which aims to shed light on anti-Semitic statements and to help raise awareness.
2020-12-06;Swiss nurses with Covid-19 urged to keep working;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-nurses-with-covid-19-urged-to-keep-working/46207172;Across Switzerland, care home staff are reporting for work even if they themselves are suffering from the coronavirus. According to the SonntagsZeitung Sunday newspaper, the management at a care home in canton Bern has asked several ill nurses – who tested positive for Covid-19 – to come to work anyway. It was not an isolated case of staff not isolating themselves. The canton of Fribourg has also approved the use of sick staff, wrote the newspaper. “We have corresponding reports from various cantons,” confirmed Yvonne Ribi of the Swiss Association of Nursing Professionals. She told the SonntagsZeitung that she knew of institutions in several cantons where, despite a positive test result and clear symptoms, nurses were urged to work in a nursing home anyway. Ribi condemned the practice. The national centre for infection prevention, Swissnoso, provides for exceptions in the event of a relevant shortage of health personnel. However, this applies only to acute hospitals. “Other non-acute medical facilities, such as nursing homes, should continue to follow the recommendations issued by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH),” state the Swissnoso guidelines. The FOPH insists on strict isolation for ill people.
2020-12-06;Switzerland plans Covid-19 vaccination strategy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-plans-covid-19-vaccination-strategy/46206788;"With a death toll of over 5,000, Switzerland (population 8.5 million) expects to launch its coronavirus vaccination campaign in early January. The goal is to inoculate six million people by summer, which will mean up to 70,000 vaccine shots per day. Switzerland has reserved about 13 million vaccine doses from two suppliers and via the World Health Organization. The cantons will decide where to provide vaccination services, at locations such as medical practices, gymnasiums and military facilities. Risk groups should be vaccinated first. In addition to senior citizens, that includes people with diabetes, chronic lung disease or high blood pressure. Since the beginning of the pandemic over 340,000 people in Switzerland have been infected with Covid-19; over 3,000 are currently in hospital, of whom almost 500 are in intensive care. On Saturday, federal and cantonal authorities discussed the Covid-19 crisis via video conference. On December 8, the federal government will decide what additional measures may be needed to prevent the spread of the virus across Switzerland and possibly in individual cantons. These will take effect on December 10. Switzerland’s decision not to close ski resorts has sparked criticism, also in other countries. On Saturday, there were reports of crowding and failure to maintain social distancing at some Swiss resorts. From December 9, all enclosed ski transport, like gondolas and trains, will be limited to two-thirds capacity. Cantons have a duty to monitor compliance, the government warned. Certain cantons have already adopted stricter measures. For example, Bernese restaurants are shutting at 9pm until December 14. In Graubünden, restaurants are closing altogether until December 18."
2020-12-05;Switzerland riles Alpine neighbours by keeping its ski resorts open;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-riles-alpine-neighbours-by-keeping-its-ski-resorts-open/46206176;As heavy snow closes in on the village of Andermatt, high in the Swiss Alps, local hotelier Johan Granvik gives short shrift to the arguments that have led other EU countries to close their ski resorts.  “If you go out on a Saturday morning to the grocery shop — you can’t tell me that’s less dangerous than spending five minutes in a télécabine and then being out on the wide open slopes,” said Granvik, who has taken on more than 30 staff for his hotel and restaurant business for the winter season. Closing the pistes to halt coronavirus “makes no sense whatsoever”, he added.  Standing by the icy river Reuss for a photograph as the snow rakes across the ground, Granvik, 35, said the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic meant bankruptcy was something he recently had to worry about for his seven-year-old business. His boutique hotel Zum Schwarzen Bären depends on a successful winter sports season. Two of his restaurants, the Wachthuus and the Rüti Hütte, are on the pistes. If the lifts do not open, neither can they.  Across the Alps, in Austria, France, Germany and Italy, ski resorts will be closed for at least a month due to fears that an influx of people will spread the virus. As a result, the winter tourism that is the single most important economic sector in the Alpine regions will be put on hold over its busiest period. But Switzerland – for now – is the exception. Bern, which imposed no second nationwide lockdown to control the second wave of coronavirus, has refused to enforce closures of ski resorts. As a result skiing has become an unlikely, but bitter, political faultline dividing European countries as they seek a response to the latest phase of the pandemic. Other European leaders have been barely able to contain their contempt for Switzerland’s recalcitrance. Both the French and Italian prime ministers have directly called the president of Switzerland’s governing federal council to demand it fall into line, officials in Bern told the Financial Times. Switzerland’s parliament this week responded with a motion condemning even the limited measures being rolled out to reduce capacity at ski resorts to 80% as too much. Foremost in EU politicians’ minds are the events of February and March, during the first wave of the pandemic, when Alpine resorts became superspreader clusters. That Switzerland, in keeping its resorts open, may become an economic beneficiary from others’ pain is particularly rankling. At Andermatt’s luxury Chedi hotel, the season is already under way, with guests enjoying a fireside drink in the lounge as porters scurry around with trolleys laden with skis, boots and expensive luggage. In the wine library, where rare vintages are stacked floor to ceiling, two businessmen had set up “home offices”. “We haven’t needed to close anything, which is good news,” said Joachim Schweier, the hotel’s marketing manager. “Bookings are tending to be more last-minute, but we’ve received a lot of interest recently.”  As questions hang over other European destinations, the Chedi is offering a private jet service to fly guests in from destinations including London, Munich and Rome – without the health risks that flying commercial during a pandemic may entail. Skiing has a reputation for frivolity – not least because of the moneyed crowd it tends to attract – but it is big business. More than a third of Swiss regularly ski for recreation.  “It's our national sport, and especially at these times with lockdowns and so many people staying at home, it’s very important that you can go out into the mountains, into the fresh air, to meet other people and to be physically active,” said Mathias Imoberdorf, spokesperson for the ski facilities at the resort of Zermatt in southwest Switzerland. “We have trust in the federal government to take the right decision,” he added. With the country still dealing with a high number of infections, however, not everyone in Switzerland is supportive of the government approach. A parody video went viral in Switzerland this week that punned on the Austrian resort of Ischgl that became a coronavirus hotspot earlier this year. It invited tourists to fictional Ischgliich – Swiss dialect for “I don’t care” – and advised booking soon, with “intensive care beds already sold out.” On Friday, Zurich’s Tages-Anzeiger newspaper asked: “Is Switzerland a liberal freak show?” Those working in the ski industry, though, draw a distinction between safe winter holidays and the kind of raucous après-ski partying that is one of Ischgl’s selling point. In Andermatt, a range of soft measures are being used to “guide” rather than “restrict” guests, said Raphael Krucker, the resort’s chief executive. Restaurants have doubled their outdoor seating capacity, indoor tables are being limited to four people, and loud music is prohibited to curb any temptation to party. Bars shut at 11pm. “The number one priority is to avoid another lockdown,” said Krucker, pointing out that the ski lifts on the Gemstock mountain had been open for weeks without any coronavirus problem. The federal government on Friday announced limited restrictions for the skiing industry. Enclosed cabins, gondolas and train compartments in resorts must restrict themselves to two-thirds of their capacity, but there will be no restrictions on numbers using ski slopes. From December 22, individual resorts will also require a licence to remain open which will be linked to hospital capacity.  Granvik, the hotelier, hoped the government would hold its nerve. “I understand shopping for food is a necessity and skiing is not. But at the same time, you cannot take everything away from people – you have to give people some glimmer of hope.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-12-04;Swiss ski resorts to remain open;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-ski-resorts-to-remain-open/46204624;The Swiss government has decided to allow ski areas to open during the holidays, despite pressure from abroad to close its resorts due to a high number of coronavirus cases.  At the same time, the government announced stricter measures on Friday to control the spread of the pandemic. Confirmed coronavirus infections rose by 4,382 in Switzerland over the past 24 hours, data from Swiss health authorities showed on Friday. The death toll rose by 101. This is the first time since the beginning of November that the number of registered coronavirus infections has risen compared to the same day the week before. It was 4,312 last Friday. “The epidemiological situation in Switzerland remains extremely serious,” the government said in statement on FridayExternal link after its meeting to discuss the pandemic and the ski resorts issue. New Covid-19 cases rose sharply in Switzerland in November. Federal and cantonal measures have slowed its spread. The number of cases has fallen but the overall total has levelled off at a high level, according to the authorities. In some cantons the numbers are stagnating or even rising. The situation in the hospitals is also tense. The aim is therefore to reduce the number of infections further, especially ahead of the holidays. The federal government called on German-speaking cantons with rising numbers to “take immediate action”. “Ski areas should be allowed to open for domestic tourism,” the government said, but resorts would need permits from cantonal governments from December 22. “The prerequisite is that the epidemiological situation so allows, and that hospitals, contact tracing services and testing sites have sufficient capacity.” Health Minister Alain Berset said the decision to keep Swiss resorts open was designed above all for people living in Switzerland...not beyond that . We don't want people coming from surrounding countries that are closed off and then for people to say that we are taking advantage of this situation, he said. That would be very unpleasant for everyone - for Switzerland and the resorts concerned. The government has not fixed any limits on the number of visitors allowed into resorts – this had been one of the possible measures mooted ahead of the cabinet meeting and rejected by parliament on Thursday. But all enclosed ski transport, like gondolas and trains, will be limited to two-thirds capacity from December 9. Cantons have a duty to monitor compliance, the government warned. Switzerland’s approach has put it on a collision course with some of its neighbours. France and Austria want to prevent their citizens from skiing abroad by imposing compulsory quarantines. On Friday, ski resorts reacted with relief to the government's announcement. But the tourism organisation Engadin St Mortiz said in a statement to the news agency AWP that the lack of foreign tourists would be a hard blow that would not be compensated by more domestic tourists. The Swiss government also announced further national measures.“There is an additional risk of the virus spreading over the festive period as people do more shopping and get together with friends and family,” the government statement continued.  The number of people allowed to be in a shop at any one time will be reduced. “The restriction (space per customer in larger stores: 10m2 instead of 4m2) will come into force on December 9 and remain in place until further notice.” For restaurants, contact details for at least one guest per table must be registered. On New Year's Eve, closing time will be extended exceptionally from 11pm to 1am to reduce the risk of spontaneous private gatherings. Singing, whether indoors or outdoors, is not permitted, apart from in a family setting or at primary and lower secondary schools, added the government. It also recommends that people from no more than two households meet privately or when visiting a restaurant to keep the number of contacts to a minimum. Meanwhile, Switzerland on Friday updated its listExternal link of countries with a high risk of coronavirus infection from which new arrivals must quarantine themselves for ten days. The United States has been added to list, which also now includes more areas of neighbouring Italy and Austria, as well as Hungary, Poland and Portugal. It takes effect from December 14. UPDATE: The lead of this story was updated on January 5, 2021.
2020-12-03;First case of a Covid-infected cat reported in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/first-case-of-a-covid-infected-cat-reported-in-switzerland/46201914;For the first time in Switzerland a cat has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Cats, like dogs, are however not believed to play a major role in the spread of the virus. According to the Federal Office for Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs (BLV)External link, the case was reported by the veterinary medicine laboratory at the University of Zurich. The cat had been tested in the context of a research project and came from a household with a person who had also tested positive. Other isolated cases of coronavirus infections in pets have been reported in other countries. Almost all the infected pets came from households with individuals who tested positive for Covid-19. In a press release, the BLV said that it believes transmission from humans to cats is rare but cannot be ruled out. It doesn’t believe regular testing for cats is necessary. Infected cats do not show any symptoms or if they do, they are usually mild. There is also no evidence that cats and dogs pose a risk of infection for humans, the office said. However, it stressed that it’s important for infected persons to observe the hygiene rules, even with cats. This includes no close contact between animals and humans such as licking of the face and letting the animal sleep in the owner’s bed. It is also important to thoroughly clean feeding bowls. It advises against disinfecting animals or putting a mask on them – “for the sake of animal welfare”.
2020-12-03;Pressure increases on Swiss ski resorts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pressure-increases-on-swiss-ski-resorts/46199694;The hopes of Swiss ski resorts for foreign tourists over the Christmas holidays could soon be dashed: France and Austria want to prevent their citizens from skiing abroad by imposing compulsory quarantines. French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday that his government would order citizens into isolation for seven days after skiing holidays abroad. Checkpoints would be set up at the borders with Switzerland and Spain. The measure would be implemented if Switzerland and Spain do not close their winter sports destinations until January, as France has done, he said. Castex said the conclusion to be drawn from this is that people should not go skiing in Spain or Switzerland. Cross-border commuters would not be affected, he added. Austria, like Switzerland, has so far refused to close its ski resorts over the holidays. However, by imposing a ten-day quarantine on travellers from high-risk areas, Austria intends to seriously limit tourism during this period. This is to prevent the virus being carried into the country by returning Austrians or tourists, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday. Germany has considered Switzerland a risk area since October 24. Accordingly, returnees have to go into quarantine for ten days. The President of the Italian Health Council, Franco Locatelli, has said that Switzerland’s decision to keep ski resorts open was disappointing. He told La Stampa that he hoped Swiss ski resorts would shut by the end of the year. If not, he said he would call for a quarantine for people returning to Italy. In the past few days Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, has been trying to find a solution to the problem and has held talks with Castex and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte among others. On Thursday, Interior Minister Alain Berset, who is also in charge of health affairs, told a press conference that “Switzerland does not react to pressure from other countries” in taking such decisions. However, he also said that should another wave of infections spread across Europe, and should some people blame it on Switzerland, it could be damaging for the country's reputation. Not making their job any easier is an alliance of centrist parties which on Wednesday called on the government not to impose drastic measures on ski resorts and mountain regions over the festive season. A declaration to this effect was then accepted by parliament on Thursday. Representatives of all the main tourism organisations and regions warned the government to be careful regarding new coronavirus measures in mountain regions. The government should leave the leadership to the affected cantons, they said. The bone of contention is a draft ordinance which the government sent to the cantons and other relevant parties for consultation a few days ago. According to this draft, Swiss ski resorts are to remain open in principle. However, in order to avoid large crowds, measures such as capacity restrictions or early closing for restaurants and bars should apply. For their part, ski resorts are ploughing ahead with preparations for the year-end holiday season despite pressure from their neighbours to shut until the latest coronavirus wave passes. Health Minister Alain Berset has proposed limits on the capacity of ski lifts at Christmas and the New Year, but lift operators and mountain regions who already expect many foreign visitors to stay away during the festive period bristle at added restrictions. Eloi Rossier, mayor of Bagnes below the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, acknowledged feeling the heat from other countries, but said that his town’s ski economy was too important to simply call off the season, especially given measures the resort was taking to keep people safe. He expects up to 45,000 people over Christmas and New Year, fewer than normal due to a lot of cancellations. “There’s an economic aspect that we can’t deny. It’s extremely important,” Rossier said. “But it’s not skiing that’s dangerous for transmitting the virus, but the stuff that comes after skiing, the après-ski. And here we have taken extremely strict measures to limit […] the risks.”
2020-12-03;WEF annual event should stay in Switzerland, say parliamentarians;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parliamentarians-call-for-the-wef-annual-event-to-stay-in-switzerland/46200644;In a letter addressed to Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, several Swiss parliamentarians have sounded the alarm over rumours that the World Economic Forum (WEF) could hold its annual event in Singapore due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation in Switzerland. The letter obtained by Swiss media agency TamediaExternal link on Wednesday warned that hundreds of jobs are at stake if WEF abandons the Alpine nation for its annual event. The elite gathering is usually held in the winter holiday destination of Davos in late January. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the WEF announced it was postponing the 2021 edition to May and was considering holding the event in another part of Switzerland, specifically the central cantons of Nidwalden and Lucerne. A few days ago, rumours began circulating in the Swiss media that the WEF is considering moving the event to Singapore due to concerns over the epidemiological situation in Switzerland. In the letter, some 20 parliamentarians from central Switzerland – mostly from centre-right and rightwing parties – called on the federal government to work to ensure that the annual event takes place in central Switzerland for the benefit of the region and all of Switzerland. The tourism industry in central Switzerland, which has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, had placed high hopes on the WEF 2021. They write that it is incomprehensible that the WEF would turn its back on the country as it is thanks to the cooperation of Switzerland that the WEF has become what it is today. In an interview over the weekend, WEF founder Klaus Schwab described the coronavirus situation in Switzerland as difficult. He also indicated that WEF’s presence in Switzerland was not certain. WEF says its flagship event that attracts thousands of politicians, businesspeople and civil society leaders contributes tens of millions of francs each year to both Davos and the Swiss economy as a whole. Many hotels and restaurants rely on the annual influx of wealthy participants for a large slice of their income.
2020-12-02;The generational digital divide climbs to age 80;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-generational-digital-divide-climbs-to-age-80/46198012;Older people are more and more at home in the digital world. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, many seniors relied on WhatsApp messaging or video calls to overcome loneliness. A recent study shows that internet use among pensioners in Switzerland has almost doubled over the past decade and allowed many to stay in touch during the pandemic. “Digital services are very popular with the over-65s,” writes Swiss advocacy organisation for older people, Pro Senectute. “In their use of communication technologies, young retirees are managing to compete with the younger generations.” Things change at a later stage in life: the real digital divide now starts at around age 80. According to the findings of the Digital Senior 2020External link study, commissioned by Pro Senectute and carried out by Center of Gerontology at the University of Zurich, 74% of people aged 65 and above use the internet. This represents a real jump from 38% in 2009, when the first survey was carried out. The study also shows that since the second survey, held in 2014, mobile web use (via smartphones or tablets) in this age group has surged from 31% to 68%. In addition to sending emails and searching for information on the web (users’ first preference, the study found), older netizens make use of a wide range of other possibilities. They do their shopping online or keep in touch with family and friends via video calls, options that have proved vital during the semi-lockdown. “The coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated the importance of digital communication channels for taking part in social life. Many families have started using applications such as FaceTime, Zoom or WhatsApp with their grandparents, in order to maintain visual contact despite physical distance,” says Tatjana Kistler, spokeswoman for Pro Senectute. Kistler stresses the importance of maintaining social contacts, especially for adults with reduced mobility, and their positive impact on physical and psychological well-being. With this in mind, Pro Senectute and various other organizations offer courses to enable seniors to explore communication technologies. For instance, UNITRE – the only Italian-speaking university outside Italy – is present in eight towns in German-speaking Switzerland. It includes computer courses in its programmes. “We should not forget that there are still 400,000 older people in Switzerland who do not use the internet. It is up to us to support them with advice and services, so that they can take part in an increasingly digitalised society and are not left out,” says Kistler. In the 2019 survey, 26% of respondents said that they did not use the internet. Some 5% were living in retirement homes. Logically, the older people get, the less they use new communication technologies. However, there are netizens over the age of 80 in Switzerland, as in other countries. SWI swissinfo.ch spoke with a fervent promoter of new technologies – a Japanese woman who, at 82, has developed a smartphone app that encourages the use of new technologies to help older people maintain their independence. The latest Pro Senectute survey also looked at the digitalised services that are now ubiquitous in daily life: from self-service supermarket checkouts to wristband activity monitors to the online payment of taxes and other public services. The researchers found that the types of internet use were largely unchanged since the previous survey: searching for information and sending and receiving emails (100% in both cases) remained at the top, followed by chats, phone calls, browsing and checking timetables and travel information. Between 50% and 65% of those questioned search for health information, read newspapers and do banking online. Fewer than 50% use apps for administrative tasks, online shopping or live streaming. In addition to the quantitative study on the use (or not) of the internet among people aged 65 and over, Digital Senior 2020 gathered opinions on various technology-related issues. For instance, 57% of respondents thought that “technological progress should continue” and that they “could no longer imagine their lives without technology.” However, four in ten respondents said they had difficulty in coping with technology, while 37% agreed with the statement that “increasing digitalisation brings more advantages than disadvantages for society.” Interestingly, 61% of those surveyed rejected the idea of using robots to help care for the elderly. The study also revealed that education and income levels were higher among web users. Respondents not using the internet said they found it too complicated to use (77%), were concerned about security issues (74%), or could not be bothered to learn (65%).

2020-12-02;More gold changing hands in uncertain times;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/more-gold-changing-hands-in-uncertain-times/46193640;The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the gold market. More customers are buying and selling the precious metal, and demand from investors is growing. “This ingot is now worth CHF57,000 ($63,000). At the beginning of the year it was CHF50,000. During the crisis it was CHF60,000”. Gold dealer Ralph Thoma holds up a one-kilo ingot of gold as he explains. A well-known figure in the gold business, Thoma is head of Aurofin in Chiasso. This year his company saw demand double from investors, both Swiss and foreign. The gold market, Thoma says, needs “the price to keep moving”. This means that crises are, paradoxically, a good thing. That was how it was in 2008, with the collapse of financial markets, and it is happening again, at least to some extent, with the current pandemic. The price of gold has gone up, and demand is high. In this business, the Swiss are major players: some 70% of the world’s annual gold output is refined in this country, and three of the leading refineries are located in Ticino (Valcambi, Argor-Heraeus and Pamp). While there are people wanting to buy gold, there are also people who, due to the crisis, need to sell theirs. Online demand has just exploded, as Nicola Esposito, consultant and administrator of Goodwill Asset Management in Chiasso, says. “On our site, compared to six months ago, requests have tripled,” he explains. These are people who have googled “sell gold in Ticino” or similar wording (there have been 151,000 such searches) and they now want his company to tell them how to do it. The tendency is confirmed by dealers who do over-the-counter business. Francesco Ardemagni, who is the proprietor of several bureaux de change and outlets buying gold in Stabio, says that “in this time of crisis, people are liquidating gold assets to get by”. Italian customers in particular have been coming in over the past number of months with bracelets, ear-rings, and rings, he says. Whereas Swiss have mostly been selling coins and gold bars to profit by the current high price of gold. Switzerland has laxer rules than Italy and some other European countries for buying and selling gold. Jewellery, in particular, does not come under federal money-launderingExternal link legislation, which regulates trade in gold bars, gold grains and gold coins with a minimum fineness of 995 parts per thousand. In these cases, a transaction under CHF15,000 can be done anonymously. Where the price ranges from CHF15,000-100,000, the customer must be identified and must certify that they have the financial means to complete the transaction. For sales of over CHF100,000, as well as establishing the customer identity, he or she must also disclose the source of their funds. In all cases, transactions can be done in cash without limit. These rules do not apply, however, to used precious metals, which can be bought and sold without any checks being made. The federal government, in its statement on amending its money-laundering legislationExternal link, has spoken of a “gap needing to be bridged” here, and explicit “risks of money laundering”, which is why it has been proposing stricter standards. But both chambers of parliament have turned down the proposed tightening-up of the legislation. “Anyone involved in buying gold is considered high-risk”, explains the financial self-regulating body OAD-FCT, one of two organisations in Ticino that monitor the sector. Gold traders do not come directly under Finma, the federal agency monitoring financial markets, but they belong to these self-regulating bodies which are the only ones that monitor the sector. Most gold buyers in Ticino belong to PolyReg, which declined an interview. In addition, like all other goods, gold is subject to customs inspection, points out Maurizio Sabino, who heads the precious metals section of the federal customs administration. “If an item is imported for purposes of trade, it has to go through customs and pay the duty – there is no exemption, he explains. So a customer who crosses the border from Italy to sell coins or jewellery is expected to make a customs declaration. The federal watchdogs are also concerned about exports of old gold to be melted down: this is a way of getting around Swiss standards, which require refineries to certify the source of the precious metals.
2020-12-01;Incomplete data stalls Swiss authorisation of Covid-19 vaccines;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/incomplete-data-stalls-swiss-authorisation-of-covid-19-vaccines/46196598;Switzerland’s medical regulator Swissmedic says it lacks the necessary information to sign off on three different coronavirus vaccines ordered by the government.    The regulator said important data on safety, efficacy and quality are still missing. It has reached out to the manufacturers, who provided data from their studies.  “We lack data on the effectiveness of the clinical trials and on the important subgroups that participated in these large studies,” said Claus Bolte, head of the authorisation division at Swissmedic, at a press briefing on Tuesday organised by the Federal Office of Public Health.  For example, Swissmedic wants to know about the pre-existing illnesses of the people who took part in these studies. According to the regulator, acceptance of such rapidly developed vaccines requires a high degree of trust in manufacturers and approving authorities. It is therefore important to examine very closely the effects on different groups of people.  The government has already placed orders for several million shots of vaccine from three manufacturers: Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Moderna.  At the press conference, authorities said vaccines will be offered free of charge and priority will be given to the most vulnerable groups and health workers. The services of the army will be enlisted to ensure stockage and distribution and the country’s 26 cantons will be in charge of setting up vaccination centres. 
2020-12-01;Campaign launched to make vaccination consent mandatory;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/campaign-launched-to-make-vaccination-consent-mandatory/46195852;A people’s initiative to guarantee the right to prior consent to vaccination has been launched in Switzerland.   On Tuesday a group called the Swiss Freedom Movement was given the green light to start collecting signatures for their initiative, called “For freedom and integrity – Stop compulsory vaccination”. They want to ensure that people who refuse to be vaccinated do not suffer any social or professional consequences.  Supporters want to amend the article of the Swiss constitution concerning the right to life and personal liberty by adding the notion of consent. They want to make consent mandatory for every violation of a person's physical or psychological integrity.  If the person concerned refuses to give consent, he or she must not be punished or suffer any social or professional harm, says the text of the initiative, which was published on Tuesday in the Federal Gazette.  Backers of the initiative have until June 1, 2022, to collect over 100,000 signatures to force a nationwide vote.  In Switzerland, people appear to be increasingly unwilling to be vaccinated against coronavirus. An online survey published last week on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health found that 49% of respondents said they would agree to a vaccination. The figure is down from over 60% in March and April. 
2020-11-30;Covid-19: most school ski camps are cancelled;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--most-school-ski-camps-are-cancelled/46193468;Far fewer children than normal will be taking part in school ski camps this year – a lasting tradition in Switzerland – due to the coronavirus pandemic, reports say. Ski camps have already been contending with falling popularity over recent years. There is also currently an international debate on the merits of opening Swiss ski resorts over the holiday period as European countries struggle to contain coronavirus infection numbers. Older pupils usually spend a week in the snow during term time. It’s a way for them to get to know snow sports (they are now often referred to as “snow sports” camps as there are opportunities to try snowboarding, cross-country skiing or even ski jumping) as well as enjoy some independence and develop their social skills. But the latest figures published in the NZZ am SonntagExternal link newspaper show an expected drop in camp and attendance numbers this year. Usually 100,000 pupils go, attending 2,300 camps during the winter season. This season. just 111 camps have been registered with the Youth and SportsExternal link promotion programme run by the Federal Office of SportsExternal link. It’s a similar story at Snow Sports Initiative SwitzerlandExternal link, which promotes snow sports in schools. “More than half of the 250 camps that had been originally booked with us have been cancelled,” said director Ole Rauch. Cantons are in charge of education matters in Switzerland. So far, 11 of them have banned ski camps altogether due to the coronavirus pandemic and fears that the virus could be easily transmitted among large groups of young people, despite distancing and hygiene measures. A further four cantons “recommend” against organising camps, and two have permitted them, but there has been no take-up, the newspaper reported. In canton Zurich, obligatory school ski camps are not allowed, but voluntary ones are, said Ralph König from the cantonal sport department. Only those that keep to strict protection measures will take place. “There won’t be any huge ski camps,” he told the newspaper. “The children should stay in the same group for the whole camp: on the pistes, at mealtimes and in their spare time,” he said. Around half of the normal 1,000 camp places remain unfilled, he added. Ski camps have already been suffering due to the cost, competition from other sports and holiday destinations and safety concerns on the part of parents and teachers. A court ruling in late 2017 also raised fears of the tradition dying out. It said that schools may only ask parents for up to CHF16 ($16) a day during obligatory excursions and camps, the amount parents would spend on feeding their children at home. Before that parents were paying CHF150-CHF300, and sometimes more, for a snow sports trip. However, as we have previously reported, schools have been managing to find workarounds and more students were starting to take part again. There is also a debate about the ski season in general. Last week, the Swiss government announced that ski resorts could open, provided they comply with strict protection measures. France, Italy, Austria and Germany have said that high-altitude lifts should remain closed for now, in the hopes that all resorts can then benefit at peak season, when and if infection rates go down.
2020-11-28;Scepticism grows against anti-Covid vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/scepticism-against-anti-covid-vaccine-grows/46190500;People in Switzerland appear to be increasingly unwilling to be vaccinated against coronavirus, according to a new poll. An online survey published on Friday on behalf of the Federal Health Office found that 49% of the respondents said they would agree to a vaccination. The figure is down from over 60% in March and April. The Sotomo research instituteExternal link, which carried out the poll, said the loss of confidence in a vaccination was “problematic”. More than 1,600 people took part in the survey which was conducted between October 22 to October 28. Interior Minister Alain Berset on Thursday said a vaccination campaign in Switzerland could begin “early next year”. He reiterated there would be no obligation for the population to get vaccinated. The government aims to make a vaccination free of charge, according to Berset, with financial contributions by the national and cantonal authorities as well as the health insurance companies. He said the planned immunisation campaign as the “greatest logistical challenge ever for the Swiss health system. A senior health official expressed understanding about the growing skepticism about an anti-Covid-19 vaccine. Nora Kronig, deputy director of the Federal Health Office, said safety and transparency were key for the provision of a vaccine in Switzerland. She said any vaccine would have to be tested and approved, she told the local newspaper, Walliser Bote. The government has contracts with three international companies for the supply of vaccines.
2020-11-27;Number of suspected Covid bail-out fraud cases explodes;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/number-of-suspected-covid-bail-out-fraud-cases-explodes/46188992;Switzerland is investigating more than 4,500 cases of suspected abuse by companies claiming emergency bailout loans during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of suspect claims has increased five-fold since late summer and now covers CHF1.2 billion ($1.3 billion). The latest reportExternal link from the Federal Audit Office (FAO) shows a rise in detected irregularities from 859 at the end of July to 4,646 in October. Most companies are suspected of paying dividends, which is not allowed under the loan terms, or inflating reported turnover to secure a bigger loan. The suspected bad apples were among more than 130,000 applications for state-backed bridging loans that were reviewed by the FAO. This covered CHF16.4 billion, the lion’s share of loans that were distributed up until the end of July. Irregularities were therefore detected in 3.5% of applications, but this is not indicative of proven fraud as further checks are being carried out in many cases. By mid-October some CHF29 million in bridging loans had been written off, as some companies went bust anyway. But another CHF576 million had already been paid back. The FAO report also stated that CHF7.5 billion has been distributed from state coffers to compensate employees put on short time working. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) has recovered CHF1.1 million and filed six criminal complaints against companies that allegedly fabricated such claims. This may be just the tip of the iceberg as the FAO and unemployment insurance funds have reported “many hundreds” of cases of suspected abuse to SECO – of which 217 cases are currently subject to detailed scrutiny. The FAO report, which was issued on Friday, also points to 540 suspicious cases among self-employed people claiming compensation. “Distributing the money was quick to do but making corrections afterwards is hard work,” the report states. “Nonetheless, this must be done. Mistakes must be corrected, cases of abuse must be pursued – in the spirit of fair and equal treatment, on which taxpayers and recipients must be able to rely.”
2020-11-27;Facebook’s Libra currency to launch next year in limited format;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/facebook-s-libra-currency-to-launch-next-year-in-limited-format/46188266;The long-awaited Facebook-led digital currency Libra is preparing to launch as early as January, according to three people involved in the initiative, but in an even more limited format than its already downgraded vision. The 27-strong Libra Association said in April that it had planned to launch digital versions of several currencies, plus a “digital composite” of all of its coins. This followed concerns from regulators over its initial plan to create one synthetic coin backed by a basket of currencies. However, the association would now initially just launch a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar, one of the people said. The other currencies and the composite would be rolled out at a later point, the person added. Libra’s exact launch date would depend on when the project receives approval to operate as a payments service from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, but could come as early as January, the three people said. Finma said it would not comment on Libra’s application, which was initiated in May.  First launched in June 2019, the scaling down of Libra’s vision comes as it has received a sceptical reception from global regulators, who have warned that it could threaten monetary stability and become a hotbed for money laundering. While the restricted scope may appease wary regulators, critics have complained that a move to single-currency coins could hit users looking to convert currencies with additional costs, undermining its ambition to enable greater financial inclusion. Originally launched by Facebook executives, Libra suffered a difficult birth when a wave of its founding members — including PayPal, Mastercard, Vodafone and eBay — quit over in late 2019 and early 2020 and distanced themselves from the controversial project. The association then announced in April that it was overhauling its vision to address regulators’ worries, limiting its scope and promising extra measures to police its system for abuse.  Libra had also come under fire for its close association with the social media network, which has faced multiple privacy scandals.  But several Libra members said that they believed the appointment of HSBC legal chief and former George W Bush-era terrorism finance tsar Stuart Levey in May as its first chief executive marked a turning point for the project, as it sought to cast itself as independent from Facebook. Since then, a handful of members have been racing to build and test their own products to launch on top of the digital currency network when it goes live.  Among them is Novi, the Facebook subsidiary rebranded from Calibra that has been creating a digital wallet to allow Facebook users to hold the Libra currency.  One person involved in Novi said that the wallet was “ready from a product perspective”, but would not be rolled out everywhere initially, with the company prioritising “half a dozen high-volume remittance corridors” including the US and some Latin American countries. Novi needed its own licence in each US state, the person said, adding that it had been granted many of these but was still waiting on “as many as 10” — including a New York Bitlicense. It remains unclear how some of the major members of the consortium — such as Uber and Spotify — plan to wield the currency, with some telling the Financial Times that they would wait to see how it was received after its launch, before investing in use cases. The news comes as Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, rallied to record highs of close to $20,000 this week, amid rising interest in digital currencies from professional investors and central banks, and as the coronavirus pandemic has quickened a shift from cash towards digital payments. Meanwhile, PayPal, which was the first founding member to drop out of the Libra initiative, announced last month that it would launch support for cryptocurrencies, including at the checkout, with Dan Schulman, chief executive, calling the shift to digital forms of currencies “inevitable”.  The Libra Association and Novi declined to comment.

2020-11-26;Swiss retain top spot as Europe’s most avid train travellers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-retain-top-spot-as-europe-s-most-avid-train-travellers/46187706;The Swiss travelled more often by rail than anyone else in Europe in 2019, taking the train an average of 74 times and covering a distance of 2,505km. The figures published on Thursday by Litra, the Swiss information service for public transport, reveal the Swiss travelled nearly twice as often by rail as people in Luxembourg (40 times), which took second spot. Rail networks in countries at the other end of the scale, such as Estonia, Croatia and Greece, are less well developed, with citizens taking the train on average just five times a year. In terms of kilometres covered per capita, the Swiss are also well ahead of others, with Austrians (1,489km) and Swedes (1,415km) coming a distant second and third respectively. The Swiss even increased their train travel from 2018, when they took the train an average 71 times. However, figures for 2020 are likely to paint a different picture as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Public transport companies had to cut services drastically during a nationwide lockdown in spring and suffered from lower passenger numbers even after restrictions were eased. The Swiss Federal Railways recently announced it was reducing train services to neighbouring Italy, France and Germany as a result of partial lockdowns to fight the second wave in those countries.
2020-11-26;Merkel calls for closure of ski resorts across EU;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/merkel-calls-for-closure-of-ski-resorts-across-eu/46186790;German chancellor Angela Merkel has called on the EU to close all ski resorts over Christmas and New Year in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, putting her on a collision course with Austria. In a statement to the Bundestag, Ms Merkel appealed to people to avoid all tourist travel. “The skiing season is approaching, [and] we will push for a vote in Europe to close all ski resorts,” she told MPs. She acknowledged, however, that Austria was opposed to the idea. “It doesn't look like . . . it will be easy to do, but we will try again anyway,” she said.  Austria has signalled that it has no intention of closing its ski resorts. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday it was “not a matter in which the EU should interfere”. But there is clear disunity in the ranks of Alpine countries. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned his countrymen not to ski over Christmas and New Year, saying that “holidays on the snow” would not be possible this year. “We can’t afford it,” he said. Jean Castex, the French prime minister, said ski resorts in France would remain open at Christmas but ski lifts would be closed. German officials worry about a repeat of the first wave of infections, when Ischgl, the Austrian ski resort, became one of the most notorious superspreader events. Tourists from Israel to Singapore were infected with coronavirus while skiing there, and then unknowingly brought the virus back to their home countries. Ms Merkel’s announcement in the Bundestag came hours after her video conference with the leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states, in which they decided to extend the country’s partial shutdown until December 20. One of the measures they agreed on was an appeal to people to avoid all private tourist travel, including skiing holidays. The leaders also called on the German government to push for an EU-wide ban on skiing tourism until January 10. Markus Söder, the powerful prime minister of Bavaria, said after the meeting that the point was not “to forbid all fun and pleasure from skiing”. “But we’re simply worried about Austria,” he said. Mr Söder added that even the head of Austria’s medical association had warned of the risks. The Austrian authorities, however, have rejected Germany’s misgivings. “Winter holidays in Austria will be safe,” said Elisabeth Köstinger, the country’s tourism minister, said on Wednesday. Officials say bars and entertainment will be strictly curbed and social-distancing measures enforced on ski lifts. The ski sector contributes 4 per cent to Austria’s gross domestic product and accounts for almost 8 per cent of employment in the country over the winter months, said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING. “Something like 25 per cent of all touristic accommodation can be related to the winter ski season [in Austria],” he said. In Switzerland, meanwhile, many of the country’s largest ski areas are already opening. While restrictions apply in some of the western French-speaking cantons hardest hit by the new outbreak of infections, in others, such as Graubünden in the east, resorts are gearing up for business as usual. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, would not be affected by a bloc-wide ban. Markus Häsler, the chief executive of Zermatt’s ski lift and railway operator, said Italian and German calls to close resorts were nothing but “hot air”. Switzerland, he said, “will never ever go along”. But nervousness about the prospect of EU governments forbidding its citizens from skiing in the Alps is growing. The Luzerner Zeitung, a Swiss newspaper, warned its readers on Thursday to prepare for a “ski war” with Europe. The KOF Swiss Economic Institute has forecast a 30 per cent fall in overnight stays in the country this winter, contributing to a more than CHF10 billion ($11 billion) decline in tourism revenue this year. Italy’s ski resorts earn annual revenues of about €11 billion, a third of which comes from the period between Christmas and New Year, when many Italians holiday in the Alps and the Dolomites. The French government estimates the country’s ski resorts provide more than 120,000 jobs and contribute about €2 billion to exports. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-11-19;Hundreds demonstrate in Geneva over restrictions on business;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hundreds-demonstrate-in-geneva-over-restrictions-on-business/46172864;Nearly 600 people demonstrated on Thursday afternoon in Geneva at the behest of the association of café owners, restaurateurs and hoteliers.  The authorised rally was aimed at demanding the immediate reopening of all businesses despite current coronavirus restrictions. Canton Geneva introduced a partial lockdown on November 2. Bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have had to close.  In a letter addressed to the authorities, the association said that the measures to close shops have had no impact on the survival of the virus. It called for the immediate lifting of the measures to close all shops. According to the canton’s Department of Safety, Employment and Health, shops and restaurants, as well as customers, risk heavy fines in case of infringement. Since the start of the second partial lockdown at the beginning of November, 28 establishments have been sanctioned. On Wednesday, the local government announced the reopening of hairdressing salons and beauty institutes from Saturday. However, non-essential shops, cafés and restaurants must wait. Geneva is the only canton where small shops are closed. The aim of the government is to enable shopkeepers and restaurateurs to open before Christmas. Pushback against the closure of shops has been growing in Geneva for the past few days. An unauthorised demonstration on Saturday saw between 600 and 700 people gather to protest in the city centre. 
2020-11-19;Despite Covid-19, digital signature collection has not taken off;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/despite-covid-19--digital-signature-collection-has-not-taken-off/46169112;The coronavirus pandemic is weighing on democracies, with many initiatives blocked by difficulties collecting signatures on the streets. What are the digital alternatives? With the pandemic turning the world on its head, one might suppose that the time has come for the digital collection of signatures for initiatives, referendums and petitions. But at a time when collecting on the street is difficult, the impetus for introducing alternative means is still absent, despite the fact that digital collection tools have proven themselves in practice for over ten years now. Since 2007, the two leaders in the field, avaaz.orgExternal link and change.orgExternal link, have drawn millions to sign up to campaigns on their platforms. So far only a few countries have turned to digital tools to collect signatures, among them Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, Latvia, Denmark, some individual US states and – to some extent – Switzerland. Around the world, it’s striking that digital signature collection is primarily used for non-binding initiatives, i.e. petitions. The more legally binding the campaign is – whether an initiative or a referendum – the more the rules are based on traditional, analogue signature collecting. In the US, however, the pandemic has given new momentum. Massachusetts and Ohio were the first states to give the green light to electronic signatures for people’s initiatives, says Evan Ravitz, the founder of Strengthen Direct DemocracyExternal link, a platform that seeks to reinforce the rights of citizens as laid out in the US constitution. Initiatives to promote e-collecting have also been launched in Arkansas, Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Arizona – where citizens can support candidates for office onlineExternal link to ensure they get on the ballot. “Everyone here knows that collecting signatures online is safer than doing it in person,” says Ravitz, referring to the risk of Covid-19. Even politicians who were previously against e-collecting are now in favour of it. E-collecting is an issue in Asia too: in Taiwan a law introducing signature collecting for people’s initiatives is planned. However, fear of Chinese manipulation has so far prevented it from happening. Europe is where e-collecting is most common. The biggest impetus for this has come from the European Union’s European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). Such an initiative comes into being when 1 million EU citizens from at least seven EU member states sign up to a proposal within 12 months – digitally. The European Citizens’ Initiative isn’t, however, binding for the European Commission. EU leaders still have trouble trusting EU citizens with direct-democracy instruments. “The Brexit plebiscite reinforced the general mistrust in Brussels – there was a fear of waking sleeping dogs with referendums,” says Xavier DutoitExternal link. A Swiss expert in open data, Dutoit has been developing tools for democratic online campaigns for more than ten years. His company Fix the Status QuoExternal link is based in the Estonian capital Tallinn, a digitalisation hub. Apart from the EU’s own platform, Dutoit’s system for online signature collection is the only one to be certified for European Citizens’ Initiatives. He has so far worked on nine of them. Switzerland has a special position – in part because it has the strongest direct democracy system on a national level. But also because e-collecting was until recently a part of the government’s “Electronic Voting” program, whose goal is to introduce e-voting as the third official channel for voting in Switzerland (after in-person and postal voting). But in 2017 the Federal Chancellery delivered a setback to digital signature collection. This was disappointing for Daniel Graf, who founded the platform WecollectExternal link in 2016. Committees can now only use Wecollect for “semi-digital” signature collections for people’s initiatives and referendums. It is semi-digital because supporters have to print, sign and send their forms by post. “The signal was already sent in 2002, when the government decided to prioritise e-voting over e-collecting,” Graf says. “It has stuck to that to this day.” He has since transferred his platform to the Foundation for Direct DemocracyExternal link. Sophie Fürst sits on this foundation’s boardExternal link. She is convinced that the coronavirus pandemic has clearly demonstrated that Swiss democracy needs e-collecting. “Collecting signatures depends on direct contact with people, which is difficult at the moment,” Fürst argues. “Signature-collecting has become less safe, more complicated and more expensive in the last months.” The lockdown and restrictive measures have caused initiatives and referendums to be interrupted or threatened with cancellation, she says. One prominent victim was the people’s initiative for a moratorium on e-voting: the committee abandoned collecting signatures in June after the lockdown. In the five years since it was founded, Wecollect has proven that it fulfils a need: so far, the tool has collected almost 520,000 semi-digital signatures for a total of 37 initiatives. Xavier Dutoit in Tallinn says he would welcome e-collecting in Switzerland. He sees advantages, beyond the pandemic, in the lower cost for committees. In addition, actors and supporters of a campaign can create new communities, he reckons. At the same time, Dutoit has concerns. He says Switzerland might sacrifice offline connections, which are unquestionably a strength of its direct democracy. And e-collecting could prove a boost for “slactivism” – a term for short-lived, unbinding engagements without deep-seated conviction for political change. Dutoit also raises the trust question. “Everyone understands the pen-and-paper system,” he says. “But how many understand the coding algorithms which guarantee confidentiality and integrity for online signatures? And if people don’t understand the process, how can they trust the result?” But he is certain that Switzerland is ideally suited to experiment with e-collecting and to develop it further. “It just requires time and practice to win the confidence of all citizens,” he says.

2020-11-19;Swiss schools stay open as debate over virus spread continues;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-schools-stay-open-as-debate-over-virus-spread-continues/46166654;Austria has closed all schools to curb rapidly rising coronavirus cases, but neighbouring Switzerland has no plans to follow suit. Swiss authorities have based this decision in part on the belief that children are not drivers of the pandemic, although research on this is divided. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has ordered all schools to move to distance learning from this past Tuesday, as part of a new national lockdown that will last at least two and a half weeks. Nurseries and primary schools will remain open only to those requiring childcare. In Switzerland schools remain open, after closing during the first wave in spring. As reported coronavirus cases surge in the country, reaching more than 10,000 new cases per day at some point in early November, more questions are being raised about the choice to stay open.  “Switzerland wants to avoid a second school closure by sending affected students or classes into quarantine,” Beat A Schwendimann, board member of the Federation of Swiss TeachersExternal link, told SWI swissinfo.ch, adding that it was important that those affected received the digital equipment and learning material they needed for distance learning.Swiss officials have held throughout the pandemic that it is better for children’s education if they can attend school in person. “The decision whether to close schools again lies with the cantonal department of education or the Federal Council,” Schwendimann said. In Switzerland education is a cantonal matter (so cantons would normally decide on school closures), and the Federal Council (Swiss government) stepping in to close schools nationwide in spring was unprecedented. The federal government did tighten measures in Swiss schools in late October, including masks for teachers and pupils over 12. Any further restrictions have been left to individual cantons. A key question driving decisions over school closures is to what extent children spread the virus. Swiss officials have long communicated that they do not consider children the primary drivers. Researchers have also been looking into the issue. Susi Kriemler, the leader of the ongoing Ciao Corona study in canton Zurich looking at schoolchildren’s role in the pandemic, recently told Swiss public television SRFExternal link that the results thus far show that younger children have not generally been the problem, despite very occasionally infecting peers or a parent. “At the moment it looks like teenagers are more affected. Their behaviour and potentially also their immunity are different,” the University of Zurich professor said. The interim results of the antibody study, published in September, help justify schools staying open for now, she said. Those results showed two points of interest: that 2.8% of children tested in canton Zurich displayed antibodies against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus – about the same percentage as among a randomly selected sample of adults. Symptoms, like coughing, were not very specific as they occurred at the same rate in both infected and coronavirus-free children. But overall, there was no clustering of Covid-19 infections in schools in canton Zurich in the first wave, the study concluded. Ciao Corona tested 2,500 pupils across the canton from mid-June to mid-July 2020 to see if they had previously been infected - and therefore developed antibodies to the coronavirus - during the early onset of the pandemic. Further tests, taken from spit and blood samples, are taking place now and in spring 2021. But some well-known scientists in Switzerland say that there could be a high number of unrecorded cases in schools. Geneva virologist Isabella EckerleExternal link has therefore called for more coronavirus tests and masks for primary school pupils. Epidemiologist Olivia Keiser told SRF that there were several indicators suggesting that children’s role in the pandemic was underestimated. “Schools were often closed in the first wave. Since then the percentage of children who have tested positive has risen,” she saidExternal link. Zurich Children’s Hospital infectious diseases specialist Christoph Berger confirmed that more children had been infected in the second wave. But only very few of them became ill. “Children shed viruses but because they hardly have any symptoms, they are not passed on,” he told SRF. Viruses are passed on foremost through coughs or sneezes, he said. Berger believes that schools and creches should stay open. “This is important for children and adults. But we must ensure that parents don’t infect their children. But children among children is not problematic.” However, the doctor said that if the second wave continued, masks could make sense for younger children. “Every mask stops an infection from being passed on,” he said. Anti-corona measures in schools have been tightened since the end of October amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the country. Each canton has different rules in place. But schoolteachers at all levels in the country are already wearing masks, as are students older than 12, the Federation of Swiss Teachers’ Schwendimann explained. Currently, pupils under 12 remain exempt from wearing masks in Switzerland. “Additionally, social distancing measures and hand disinfection are in force. It is difficult to enforce the wearing of masks for younger students,” Schwendimann sai 
2020-11-19;Pandemic very much at the top of Swiss ‘worry list’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-very-much-at-the-top-of-swiss--worry-list-/46171416;The insecurity brought by Covid-19 is the biggest concern for the Swiss population in 2020, an annual survey has found. Unemployment and retirement provision also weigh heavily. Just over half of respondents to the 2020 “Worry BarometerExternal link” said coronavirus was their biggest concern, the Crédit Suisse bank said on Thursday. Retirement provision – last year’s top concern – and unemployment were next on the list, at 37% and 31% respectively. “This is the first time in the history of the Worry Barometer that an entirely new issue has so clearly topped the list,” the bank wrote. By comparison, it said, in 2001, the year of the World Trade Centre attacks, 27% of respondents named “terror” as one of their greatest worries. The concerns around Covid-19 are largely based on an expectation of various long-term changes that respondents felt would result from the pandemic. On the negative side, these changes include a sense that unemployment will rise in the next three years (78% think this), that retirement provisions may be impacted (59%), and that tourism in Switzerland will suffer (51%). On the positive side, the prospect of more home office and the digitalisation of work was seen as a welcome change by many – as was the sense that healthcare services would benefit and that Switzerland’s location as a banking hub would be boosted. Internationally, the respondents were also relatively upbeat: over half foresee the pandemic having a positive influence on global political and economic cooperation. However, a large majority also agreed that the government should bring manufacture of medical supplies and replacement parts “back to Switzerland”. Echoing initial trends in the spring, trust also saw a bounce in 2020 compared to previous years. Most Swiss political institutions, and especially the governing federal council, saw a jump in the level of confidence they enjoy among citizens. The police meanwhile enjoyed the highest level of confidence of citizens, at 70%. The survey, which is in its 44th edition, asks respondents to list their top five concerns and to answer various questions about Swiss identity. This year, 1,800 citizens were polled by the gfs.bern research group between July and August.
2020-11-17;Gold industry’s reform efforts marked by fears and finger-pointing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/gold-industry-s-reforms-marked-by-fears-and-finger-pointing/46164798;With a pandemic driving up gold prices and a looming Swiss vote over corporate responsibility, gold refiners are under increasing pressure to guarantee a clean supply chain. But they say they can’t do it alone, and that the Swiss initiative to involve the courts goes too far. Swiss refiners, which process some 70% of the world’s gold, have long been dogged by accusations of sourcing from countries where mining has involved environmental devastation and human rights abuses. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), which employs 15-20 million workers globally, has been of particular concern as poor miners are often unable to invest in clean technology and work methods to extract the precious metal. Although ASM-sourced gold constitutes only about 1% of the global supply, in some countries it is much more. In Peru, for example, 20-30% of production is estimated to come from smaller, independent miners. The pandemic meanwhile has also strengthened gold’s status as a safe-haven asset. Historic gold prices spurred illegal mining even as some countries declared states of emergency over the coronavirus. Recently, satellite images confirmed new deforestation linked to mining in areas of the Peruvian rainforest, with increased activity also occurring in Brazil. “Gold is becoming so much more interesting than drugs. Forget cocaine in South America,” said University of Basel professor and governance expert Mark Pieth. “Why not produce gold? You won’t go to prison.” That demand, coupled with the Responsible Business Initiative vote on November 29 aimed at holding Swiss multinationals accountable for abuses abroad, has increased the pressure on refiners to address problems in their supply chains, particularly surrounding ASM. “Doing business with ASM is complex and challenging, and we cannot do it alone,” said José Camino, general counsel at Swiss refiner Metalor. The company had been suspected by Peruvian prosecutors of purchasing illegally sourced gold through intermediaries, in regions where deforestation, mercury use and trafficking of girls and women took place. The company has denied the charges. Valcambi, another Swiss refiner, began processing artisanal gold from Colombia after joining a programme in 2019 aimed at helping ASM producers build sustainable and responsible supply chains. But a recent investigation by Global WitnessExternal link accused Valcambi of sourcing gold from Kaloti, a Dubai-based trader which in turn obtained the metal from mines in Sudan where human rights violations are committed and that are controlled by militias involved in war crimes. Because of their role as major buyers of gold, refiners are generally viewed as the industry’s gatekeepers, having the greatest leverage over sources and government officials when it comes to influencing practices and policies.  But Christoph Wild, CEO of Ticino-based refiner Argor-Heraeus, argues all stakeholders are responsible for improving supply chains. “Refineries are often called the gatekeepers of the industry. We have a certain responsibility sitting in the middle of the chain, which is often very complex,” he told an online conference held last month by Pieth and the Basel Institute on Governance. Wild said the manufacturing, electronics and luxury industries buying from the refiners, as well as banks, government authorities, NGOs and the end consumers, share a responsibility to enforce greater supply chain transparency. He specified that this might mean paying more for gold products and that “the end consumer has to understand that the process of responsible extraction and sourcing and traceability can command a premium, which he or she has to pay”. Andreas Missbach, head of commodities at civil society group Public Eye, is critical of refiners relying on other stakeholders to lead the change. “Gold is not a product where you can rely on customer focus to exert pressure for lasting change in the industry. They are only a fraction of the demand. On the other hand, you have investors, banks, central banks, which don’t ask those kinds of questions.” Christoph Wiedmer agrees. He directs the NGO Society for Threatened Peoples (STP), which has long demanded greater accountability by refiners. He says the many steps involved in the gold supply chain allow each party to ignore what he calls the most important issue: the conditions under which the gold is extracted. “If you ask Rolex for example, or Credit Suisse, they would say – if they say anything – the name of the miner, nothing else. If you ask the refiner, they would only say that they buy clean gold and that they are governed by institutions. Unfortunately, even these institutions do not know under what conditions the gold was produced.” Metalor and Valcambi’s experiences show the difficulty in guaranteeing that “dirty” gold is kept out of the supply chain. A Valcambi spokesperson said that the company conducts the most stringent due diligence before entering into any business relationship.Supporters of the Responsible Business Initiative argue that corporate responsibility must be held to account through the law. The initiative would allow defendants to sue corporations for abuses committed abroad in Swiss courts. But the gold industry, and the Swiss refineries at the centre of it, argue that the initiative goes too far and that they have already made significant efforts in setting and adhering to high production and traceability standards. An example is the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), the global trade group representing major players in the market, which established its own Responsible Gold Guidance standards based on principles set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Members are required to undergo regular “third-party” audits looking at where they source gold from and how.  But a recent Global Witness report called into question the effectiveness of such reviews, stating that the LBMA needs to further improve its system for assessing gold producers and refiners. In 2013 a whistleblower at accounting firm EY (Ernst & Young) revealed that while the firm was conducting an audit in line with the LBMA’s standards, it had helped cover up a review of Kaloti’s business practices. The review included buying silver-coated gold bars from Morocco to avoid export restrictions. Susannah McLaren, compliance and sourcing chief at LBMA says the auditing they require their members to do to is fully independent. She adds that the refiner pays for the process which may be done by any of the world’s four largest auditing firms. Like other associations of which refiners are part, such as the Responsible Gold Council, the LBMA relies on the goodwill of its members to implement human rights and environmental standards, which are essentially voluntary. Although the measures taken until now are far from perfect – and not legally binding – critics of the Responsible Business Initiative say a “yes” in November’s referendum may thwart any momentum in cleaning up the gold supply chain. The initiative had been formulated with weak governments and judicial systems in mind where authorities may be swayed to defend powerful international firms rather than their own populations. Diana Culillas is secretary-general of the Swiss Better Gold Association (SBGA), a government-supported non-profit which helps small-scale miners produce gold in a sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible manner. She says working with authorities under the terms of the Responsible Business Initiative could be challenging, as the SBGA experienced when trying to develop legal frameworks for small-scale miners to stop using mercury.  Some fear that Swiss businesses may decide to divest or pull out of doing business in countries where they view the risk as too high, if the referendum allows foreign plaintiffs to sue in Swiss courts. This, they say, would leave a vacuum in the gold business for players who are less equipped or less ready to try to guarantee sustainable supply chains.  “Zero risk does not exist and the initiative will bring some legal uncertainties that we consider are not in favour of promoting Swiss companies to do business in those countries,” Camino of Metalor said in a written response that also underlined the refiner’s commitment to doing business ethically.    Pieth, however, rejected the argument that refiners may be dissuaded from proceeding with “cleaner” gold measures should the referendum pass. “It’s a form of disinformation, because people are panicking due to this initiative.” For Missbach at Public Eye, which was part of the campaign that launched the Responsible Business Initiative, the upcoming vote is about something bigger. He says it’s part of a global “trend” towards mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence. “Switzerland, as a host country and one of the most important refining countries in the world, has a role to play,” he says. Recognising the changes made by some – but not all – refiners, he added: “Companies are operating at different speeds, and this is where mandatory rules set a clear line.”

2020-11-17;Geneva funeral services at full stretch as Covid deaths rise;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-funeral-services-at-full-stretch-as-covid-deaths-rise/46166714;Geneva’s funeral service is struggling to cope with a sharp rise in coronavirus-related deaths. Capacities in some other French-speaking parts of Switzerland are also at their limit.  Geneva city’s funeral services are currently carrying out 18 cremations a day, which is maximum capacity, according to a municipal spokeswoman. What’s more, it is currently taking about ten days between time of death and the funeral compared with the usual four or five days.  Places in the cold rooms of the Saint-Georges and des Rois cemeteries are all occupied, and bodies have had to be transferred to the mortuary of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG).  Jean Murith, head of private funeral firm Murith SA, confirms the exceptional situation in canton Geneva. “Fifty years in the business and I’ve never seen anything like it,” he told the Keystone-SDA news agency.  Geneva is one of the regions hardest hit in Europe by the second wave of the pandemic. It has had to transfer some Covid patients to hospitals in German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and now the death rate is also climbing.  According to Murith, mortality is currently doubling. His company has gone from three to seven funeral services a day, and he says the proportion of the deceased infected by Covid-19 is about 70%.   The pandemic is putting pressure on undertakers elsewhere too. “We’ve been facing an increase in Covid-19 and non-Covid deaths for the past two to three weeks,” said Jérôme Voisard, a funeral director in canton Jura. But the situation remains under control, he adds. “Our staff is working on a just-in-time basis, working very long days.”   The St-Léonard crematorium in Fribourg, the only private crematorium in Switzerland, is not currently overwhelmed, but activity is increasing sharply.   “We’re working non-stop 21 hours a day, with two ovens, and even on Saturdays and Sundays,” said manager Jean-Robert Krebs. The crematorium has refused requests from other cantons, saying it wants to be able to continue cremating bodies within 24 hours after arrival.  Canton Fribourg is considering using an ice rink as a mortuary for storing bodies if necessary, says Swiss public radio, SRF, and there are similar plans in cantons Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. 
2020-11-16;Authors of coronavirus-echinacea study publish a correction;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/authors-of-coronavirus-echinacea-study-publish-a-correction/46165132;The authors of a study on a Swiss drug called Echinaforce have published a correction in the specialist journal Virology. They point out that the medicine’s antiviral effect on coronaviruses was only proven in the Petri dish. Clinical studies are still needed, noted the authors on Monday. In September, Thurgau-based manufacturer A. Vogel and Spiez Laboratory published a study about the natural healing properties of Echinaforce, a drug made with the herb echinacea. They reported that the drug was able to kill coronaviruses in a test tube. Demand and sales reportedly went up. This month the authors have issued a correction in the specialist journal VirologyExternal link. According to the study, the product needs direct contact with virus particles in order to have a virus-killing effect. Because Echinaforce is taken orally, it is unclear how it would work, which is why the authors say clinical studies in humans are needed. Echinaforce preparations are herbal medicines intended for people who are prone to colds. 
2020-11-16;How Covid-19 is crash-testing Swiss federalism;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-covid-19-is-crash-testing-swiss-federalism/46164134;"Switzerland is one of the countries hardest hit by the second wave of coronavirus and is coming in for increasingly sharp criticism over inconsistencies resulting from its federal system.   Has the Covid-19 crisis revealed the limits of Swiss federalism? Discrepancies between the cantons and communication errors made by the government have come to light for all to see. But unlike in other countries, no independent body has been charged with assessing how the state or the cantons have responded to the crisis. Residents in one canton can currently travel dozens of kilometres to do some pre-Christmas shopping in another canton where non-essential stores are still open. Instances of migration like this have been observed over the past two weeks in the Lake Geneva region, since Geneva has been more restrictive in its response to the pandemic this autumn than neighbouring canton Vaud. It’s the same in canton Jura, where inhabitants this year are unable to celebrate the feast of Saint Martin, their culinary pride, after it was cancelled due to the health crisis. Many are sad to see fans of the food-heavy tradition going to satisfy their taste buds in neighbouring canton Bern; many cafes and restaurants in German-speaking cantons remain open. As the second wave of Covid-19 hit hard in October, Health Minister Alain Berset repeated that in Switzerland “people know that the closing hours for businesses vary from one canton to another. Nothing’s new”. Indeed, since the end of the first wave each canton has been singing from a different hymn sheet. The Swiss are now openly questioning the lack of consistency within the system. If the sacred union was comprehensively respected in spring during the “extraordinary situation” declared by the government, the union is now fraying a bit and opposition voices are now making themselves heard. People are feeling bewildered by the multitude of measures and recommendations issued around the country. “Without going so far as declaring a new state of emergency, the government must take back the reigns to curb mobility, [which is] a significant vector of transmission [of the virus],” said Hasim Sancar from the Green Party in Bern. At the end of spring Sancar wrote to cantonal authorities calling for a report on the management of the crisis because “we’re threatened by other pandemics worse than this one”. French President Emmanuel Macron charged Didier Pittet, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist from Geneva, with heading an independent commission to evaluate the health crisis. The first conclusions were delivered last month. The commission’s report said the French government had “measured the stakes [of the crisis] well” and “no massive or systematic failures” had been made. But the implementation of the response to the crisis had encountered difficulties such as a lack of preparedness, sometimes fraught collaborations between various health agencies and delays in delivering an adequate level of tests. Ministers and the responsible health authorities were also called before a parliamentary enquiry. In front of television cameras they had to explain failures and notably the lack of protective masks. Would such an independent commission be useful and necessary in Switzerland? “It’s clear that we must conduct a review, but on the whole federalism has held up well,” said political scientist Andreas Ladner, a specialist in public administration. In Swiss Federalism, his analysis published last year on the organisation of a non-centralised state like Switzerland, Ladner rated Swiss federalism as “generally cooperative, symmetric, competitive and supportive”. In view of the management of the current crisis, these four objectives would have passed the “crash test”, he believed. “With the possible exception of the symmetrical aspect, given the fact that the cantons are quite different from one another and have different resources,” he said. But “the level of interactions has functioned quite well between the government, the cantons and the municipalities”. Ladner believes it would serve little purpose to create an independent commission of enquiry as in France to assess the errors made in Switzerland. “Create a commission to hear what?” he asked. “It would just rehash simple, banal things that we would have already heard.”   If federalism has generated a few hiccups during Covid, they have mainly been down to poor and contradictory communication, he says. “Explaining at the beginning of the crisis that protective masks were not necessary didn’t help make things clearer,” Ladner said. “The same thing happened when the government’s Covid task force began to fuel the debate with its own conclusions.” But compared with other more centralised countries like France, Switzerland is doing quite well today, he concludes. “The Swiss federal system has so far coped well given the circumstances.”"
2020-11-16;Covid-19 sparks flood of letters to Swiss government;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-sparks-flood-of-letters-to-swiss-government/46164208;The people of Switzerland have sent thousands of letters and emails to the federal authorities regarding the coronavirus crisis. “Some say that this is the first time they’ve ever written to someone in the government. This shows how serious their concerns are,” Géraldine Eicher, deputy head of the federal communications ministry, told Swiss public radio, SRF, on Monday. These days four out of five letters have to do with the coronavirus. Eicher said the moods covered the full spectrum, from friendly, praising, concerned and demanding to angry and desperate. In comparison to the spring the mood has darkened and there’s clearly a degree of Covid fatigue, she said. One letter read, “To be honest, my hope has been gone for several weeks. I feel abandoned, lost and sometimes simply angry at the authorities’ inconsistent actions”. Another one asked President Simonetta Sommaruga, “Do you still feel what’s happening to the people of this country?” According to Eicher, the letters are something like a seismograph of society. They also show how concerned the population is. “If the number of cases increases, the number of letters increases.” 
2020-11-15;Will vaccination campaign convince hesitant Swiss?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/will-vaccination-campaign-convince-hesitant-swiss-/46163296;Faced with considerable public scepticism towards a Covid-19 vaccine, the Federal Office of Public Health is preparing an information campaign about vaccinations. However, the country’s top hospital hygienist thinks offering incentives is a better way to make people get a jab. Just 16% of Swiss would immediately get vaccinated against coronavirus, according to a surveyExternal link by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation on November 6. “No way,” said 28% of the 40,000 respondents. In the middle are many people who aren’t sure or who prefer to wait and see if any side-effects appear. Given these levels of uncertainty, the government is working on a campaign to prepare the public for a vaccination, the SonntagsZeitung reportedExternal link. “We want to provide the population with transparent information and raise awareness of a vaccination against the novel coronavirus,” health office spokeswoman Katrin Holenstein told the paper. However, as no details about the characteristics and effectiveness of the vaccine have yet been released, it was too early for the campaign, she said. Andreas Widmer, president of Swissnoso, the association of experts for infectious diseases and hospital hygiene, doesn’t think information campaigns are enough. He suggests introducing incentives to increase the willingness to vaccinate. “Only people who have been vaccinated or have a current negative test before each trip should be allowed to travel abroad by plane, coach or cruise,” Widmer told the SonntagsZeitung. “Vaccination is an expression of solidarity with society, and for this you need an individual and small sacrifice.” The Epidemics Act in fact allows the government, in consultation with the cantons, to impose an obligation to vaccinate vulnerable population groups, as well as people who carry out certain activities, such as hospital or care staff. Although Health Minister Alain Berset last week ruled out a nationwide compulsory vaccination, it is not off the table for certain groups such as nursing staff in old people’s homes. However, because it is not yet clear which vaccine will be used and whether it will lead to immunisation in older people, the health office says the introduction of a compulsory vaccination for nursing staff is not yet an issue.
2020-11-15;Graphic novel tells tale of Covid-19 impact;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/graphic-novel-tells-tale-of-covid-19-impact/46155424;In his new graphic novel “Au coeur de la vague” [At the heart of the wave], cartoonist Patrick Chappatte tells the story of the Covid-19 health crisis and the upheaval the virus has caused locally and globally. Patrick Chappatte, 53, is a well-known Swiss-Lebanese editorial cartoonist based in Geneva who works for various newspapers and magazines. He is also a pioneer of graphic journalism, or “comics” journalism, which he has developed since the 1990s in print, on the web and for TV. Last month the Fondation de Genève awarded him their 2020 prize. ChappatteExternal link also chairs the Freedom Cartoonists Foundation, a new organisation that has emerged from the Cartooning for Peace, an initiative he founded in 2010 with former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. swissinfo.ch: You have experienced the coronavirus pandemic in two ways, both as a journalist and as a patient. How did this intense experience shape your new book? Patrick Chappatte: The book tries to show both the macro and micro aspects of the pandemic – it even feature the microbe that infected me. I have tried to illustrate these different levels: the personal experience of the narrator who was so keen to describe the disease that he caught it himself (grins), but also of course the collective experience, such as at Geneva University Hospitals (HUG). Throughout the world, this experience was a local and a universal one. I try to illustrate that in this reportage. Combining these different levels is my way of describing this unprecedented experience, both collective and personal, which the initial phase of the pandemic turned out to be. What about the personal level? In early March, I started to work on the comic strip during the ten days of my isolation due to a fever. This turned out to have been caused by Covid-19, as I discovered in June. We tend to forget everything that has happened since the beginning of the year. It was all so unprecedented and traumatic, and it all happened so fast. Governments figured out ways to confine us to our homes that were pretty drastic. This took us back to what it must have been like in the Middle Ages. In this hyper-technical society of ours, the response to the age-old problem of a plague was not very modern at all: keep to yourself, and wash your hands. I soon realised that the story needed to be told, bringing together the local and the global. Faced with coronavirus, we all indulged in a certain amount of magical thinking as well. When people feel afraid, everyone holds onto what they can, and reacts either with denial, total panic, or blind obedience to some guru-like authority figure. That was the first wave, but it had all the ingredients we now find in this ongoing crisis. At the outset of the pandemic here in Switzerland, citizens obeyed government ministers and generally trusted them. Today, as we enter this terrible second wave these feelings have weakened. Haven't we learned any lessons from history? At the start, the authorities were telling us that masks were not that important – because there weren’t any. The same thing for tests. I hope this isn’t going to be the same again. That said, the virus progresses faster than we do. At the start, we were all taken by surprise. I caught it at a time when the virus still seemed a remote possibility, although it had been going around at dinner-tables in town for a while. This time, it has outsmarted us again. This new wave of contaminations had been expected, but it was supposed to come later. Of course, timing is crucial, given the exponential increase in cases of infections. But, as I say in my book, [Geneva HUG doctor] Didier Pittet was already quite aware in mid-April that autumn would be tough, politically as well as health-wise.  Even the hospitals seem to be caught off guard now, without a plan ready to put in place. Yes, but it’s not exactly the same situation now. Collectively, we are running out of steam. In my book I try to describe the sense of innocence before the virus appeared, and the upheaval caused by the first wave. I won’t be writing a volume two, because what’s happening now is not at all funny. Collectively, we have been through some very tough times. In human terms, the hospitals and the intensive-care staff have not had a chance to recover from the first wave. So the second wave is coming upon us when there is already this burden and this strain. The resources are there. But hospitals are not going to make lots of extra room for Covid patients like they did before. The first emergency plan just about shut the hospital system down. The hospitals this time may have to start doing triage with patients. We’ve never known that kind of a situation in Switzerland. We’ve certainly learned one lesson: you can’t be on maximum alert for months or even years at a stretch – because Covid seems to be settling in for the long haul. That’s what is depressing for many of us, I think. Your new book gives a comic-strip account of events, and at the end of each chapter, we see the cartoons you produced on the topic during the first wave. What’s behind this special approach? It helped me a lot as narrator. I am a newspaper cartoonist and I have been doing comic-strip journalism since 1995. At the graphic level, I use two different styles. For the comic-strip journalism, I tend towards a more realistic representation of scenes, without the biting cynicism you find in a cartoon. This book gave me an opportunity to combine these two approaches, and they actually complement each other. The press cartoons allowed me to focus on the disastrous mismanagement of Covid by Donald Trump, for example, or the wider social impact of the pandemic. These cartoons also mean you can inject a welcome dose of humour into a story which otherwise has you most of the time looking inside intensive care wards. Drawing as a form of storytelling also allows me to present these life and death places, while avoiding the trap of voyeurism and keeping a distance from shocking images. This allows the reader to feel empathy.
2020-11-14;Switzerland perceived as world’s third-strongest national brand;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-perceived-as-world-s-third-strongest-national-brand/46162222;Switzerland is one of the three strongest national brands in the world in the eyes of the global public. The latest ranking by consultants Brand Finance takes into account soft-power factors such as presence, reputation and impact on the world stage. Switzerland comes behind Germany and Britain but ahead of the United States and Canada. “Germany remains a haven of stability under the chancellorship of Angela Merkel,” said Brand Finance in its 2020 rankingExternal link, for which it surveyed over 55,000 people in more than 100 countries. A somewhat different picture emerges when the brand strength of national companies is measured. Here the US is ahead of China and Japan. Switzerland is in 15th place, between Russian and Brazil, with brand value declining by 19% to $764 billion (CHF697 billion). Switzerland is by no means alone in this decline. As almost everywhere else in the world, the coronavirus pandemic has left deep scars on valuations. Worldwide, the value of the 100 strongest brands has fallen by $13.1 trillion this year. The most valuable brand among companies remains Amazon for the third year in a row, which broke the $200 billion barrier for the first time in history. Google, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung follow. Tesla, the manufacturer of electric cars, recorded the strongest brand growth worldwide. The list of the strongest Swiss brands shows that the food company Nestlé has the greatest brand strength. With a valuation of $20.31 billion (up 3.4%), Nestlé has moved up to 81st place in the top 500 (previous year 87th). UBS follows in 202nd place, having lost 29 places compared with the previous year. Zurich Insurance is only slightly worse off in 231st place (229th last year). This also applies to the Rolex watch group in 248th place (243rd).
2020-11-14;Pacifist group slams Swiss investment in global arms industry;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pacifist-group-slams-swiss-investment-in-global-arms-industry/46140306;Promoters of an investment ban on arms manufacturers say their initiative would help Switzerland boost its international credibility. A left-wing party and a pacifist group have joined forces to try and restrict the financing of weapons producing companies. The issue will come to a nationwide vote on November 29. The proposal targets the financing of the global arms industry. It seeks to prohibit the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Swiss foundations and pension funds from investing in producers of war materiel. Thomas Bruchez is co-secretary of the pacifist Switzerland without an Army group, which launched the initiative. He explains why he advocates more sustainable investments. swissinfo.ch: Switzerland already has a law outlawing the financing of war materiel. Why do you want to introduce new constraints? Thomas Bruchez: The current situation is highly unsatisfactory. There is a ban on direct financing, but it only covers the financing of internationally prohibited weapons, that is, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines. Indirect funding is excluded only if it is intended to circumvent direct funding, which is impossible to prove. There is currently no provision preventing the financing of conventional weapons, because there is a reasoning that seeks to distinguish between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ weapons. This is very dangerous, because most human rights violations are committed with small arms. But all weapons are problematic, which is why we need a legal framework to prohibit their financing. swissinfo.ch: Do you have two examples of Swiss institutions that have invested in manufacturers of war materiel? T.B.: The Swiss National Bank invests heavily in producers of war materiel. According to figures from the NGO Pax, it is invested $1.3 billion (CHF1.2 billion) in nuclear weapons in 2018. It is also investing more than $2 billion in the US arms industry. It is even more difficult to obtain figures for pension funds, because there is no transparency. But one can make assessments based on investments in international equities, funds that include arms producers. Our estimate is that between $3.8 and 4.3 billion is invested by Swiss pension funds in war material producers. swissinfo.ch: Are Swiss institutions' investments in the arms industry significant on a global scale? T.B.: The Swiss financial centre is one of the largest and most influential in the world, managing around 25% of the world's private assets. A financing ban by Switzerland would therefore have a double impact: given the importance of its financial centre, it would mean a lot less investment in arms producers, and thanks to its influence, a ban would send a signal to the other major financial centres of the world to do the same. swissinfo.ch: Foundations and pension funds in other countries are allowed to invest in conventional war materiel. Why should Switzerland stand out? T.B.: It is true that no country has a more restrictive law. But in practice, Switzerland is not the most advanced state when it comes to sustainable investment. There are many large financial institutions that already exclude producers of war materiel. We need pioneers, and Switzerland is a good candidate because it is neutral, has a humanitarian tradition and seeks a strong international peace policy. By allowing financial institutions to invest in producers of war materiel, Switzerland is undermining its own efforts. swissinfo.ch: Isn't there a danger that Swiss financial institutions will lose out on returns if they are not free to choose their investments? T.B.: Absolutely not. Numerous studies show that sustainable investments yield returns that are as good as or even better than conventional investments. This can be seen by comparing the classic MSCI World index, which includes the world's leading companies with strong performance, with the ‘socially responsible’ MSCI SRI, which excludes, among others, arms producers. The sustainable fund has a better performance than its conventional counterpart as well as a better resistance to risks, because during the coronavirus crisis the index for the MSCI SRI lost less than the MSCI World. swissinfo.ch: Isn’t there a considerable risk that an investment ban will put Swiss producers of war materiel and small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in difficulties? T.B.: Swiss law and regulations provide a very clear definition of war materiel: Dual-use goods, both civilian and military, are not listed as war materiel. Spare parts are only considered war materiel if they cannot be used for civilian purposes. This means that the vast majority of Swiss SMEs would not be affected. The initiative defines war materiel producers as companies that generate more than 5% of their annual turnover from the production of weapons. Even if a company has a product or a large order that is considered war materiel, it is unlikely to account for more than 5% of its turnover. And in practical terms, even the major Swiss arms producers would not be affected, as they do not receive funding from the National Bank or pension funds. The impact in Switzerland would be totally negligible, because the text was constructed to affect the international arms industry and the world's largest producers of war materiel.

2020-11-14;International Geneva set to breathe easier with Biden;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva-set-to-breathe-easier-with-biden/46160686;"Officials in International Geneva have been breathing a collective sigh of relief at the news that Joe Biden looks set to become the next president of the United States. But many uncertainties remain. Over the past four years, the Trump administration’s criticism of the multilateral system and measures it has taken against the United Nations and international organisations have had a serious impact. Under Trump, the US either de-funded, withdrew from, or publicly criticised several UN agencies and affiliated institutions, including the WHO, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The WHO, WTO and Human Rights Council all have their headquarters in Geneva. Attacks by Trump “hit us head on”, recently declared former Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey. “They made people in Geneva grimace.” Over the past 12 months Joe Biden promised America’s return to multilateral organisations if he got elected. He has now cleared the 270-vote threshold to win the US election, setting him on course to be sworn in on January 20; Trump meanwhile still refuses to accept defeat. Many key figures and observers in so-called International Geneva welcome the prospect of a Biden win and a US return to the multilateral system. WHO is hoping that US President-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the organisation made by the Trump administration earlier this year. Trump has been highly critical of WHO and over its management of the Covid-19 pandemic. In May the American president said that he was “terminating” the US relationship with the specialised UN health agency. He accused it of becoming a puppet of China during the global coronavirus crisis and of failing to make reforms to the organisation that he had demanded in a May 18 letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO director general has congratulated Biden and vice-president elect Kamala Harris on their victory last Sunday, saying WHO looks forward to working “very closely” with their administration. Biden, for his part, has promised to halt the US withdrawal from the UN health agency when he enters office. “This is good news for WHO,” said Geneva-based global health expert Ilona Kickbusch reacting to the news that Biden also plans to establish a coronavirus task force. There are pressures on the president elect to also re-join the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council. The US pulled out of the council in June 2018, calling it “hypocritical and self-serving” with chronic bias against Israel and lacking reform.  “This [US] election is an important signal,” Gerald Staberock, secretary general of the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT), told the Keystone-SDA news agency. “We hope the new president will keep his word and give his country a strong role to end torture around the world.” Staberock said he hopes the new US administration will also give more support to human rights activists and that Washington continues to put pressure on China for its human rights violations. The impact of this election is “huge” for International Geneva, he declared. The US withdrawal from the Human Rights Council has caused “huge damage” and sent an “icy message to Geneva’s multilateral structures”, he added. Staberock hopes the US quickly recommits to the Geneva-based council, which he says would help reduce the influence of states with poor human rights records."
2020-11-13;Liberal Greens gain ground among Swiss voters;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/liberal-greens-gain-ground-among-swiss-voters/46159914;One year after the green wave that engulfed the Swiss parliament, a poll shows that the Green Party is losing support, while the Liberal Green Party is gaining in strength. The Swiss People’s Party remains the country's largest, but its electoral base continues to erode.  The 2019 federal elections saw the Greens make a historic leap in parliament. The Green Party won 17 seats in the House of Representatives and thus became the country's fourth largest political force. One year on, a poll of voters carried out by the sotomo research institute shows that the strength of the parties remains fairly stable: the conservative right Swiss People’s Party still commands the majority of votes, followed by the leftwing Social Democrats, the centre-right Radical-Liberal Party and the leftwing Green Party.  Despite ending up the big loser in the 2019 federal elections (-3.8 percentage points), the Swiss People’s Party remains the largest political force in the country. However, its base continues to erode with a 1.5 percentage point drop in voting intentions among respondents in the autumn 2020 survey. The Green Party holds on to most of its gains but is losing voters (-1 percentage point), while the centrist Liberal Green Party gains 2 percentage points.   “Unlike the Greens, the Liberal Greens do not yet seem to have exhausted their growth potential,” noted the sotomo report published on Friday. “They could narrow the gap and become the sixth largest political force in the country.   However, the polling firm points out that the context has changed dramatically since last year: the arrival of the new coronavirus has profoundly altered voters’ concerns. The pandemic is now perceived by an overwhelming majority of respondents (61%) as the most important challenge facing Switzerland.   However, climate change, which was the dominant theme in the 2019 elections, remains in second place (34%). The next most important issues are directly related to the pandemic: the economy, unemployment and wages. Previous major concerns unrelated to the virus have taken a back seat, such as relations between Switzerland and the European Union, immigration or pensions.  “The 2019 elections took place in an environment marked by an extremely stable economic situation,” said the research institute. “The coronavirus crisis changed the situation significantly. However, these new priorities do not appear to have significantly altered the electoral intentions.”  Voters from four of Switzerland's six largest parties now see the pandemic as the number one challenge. But supporters of the Swiss People’s Party continue to be primarily concerned about immigration and foreigners, while Green Party voters are increasingly concerned about the climate.   “Whereas a year ago, 65% of the Swiss People’s Party electorate regarded immigration as the most important challenge, this figure has now fallen to 45%,” the pollster reported. “This is probably one of the causes of this further erosion of the party's base.”  Coronavirus is also the main concern among voters in all three language regions, but this trend is even more pronounced in French-speaking Switzerland (67%) than in German-speaking (58%) and Italian-speaking (59%) regions. While climate change remains the second priority in the French- and German-speaking regions, health insurance premiums and unemployment dominate in the Italian-speaking part.   
2020-11-13;Switzerland reviews third anti-viral Covid vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-reviews-third-anti-viral-covid-vaccine/46160356;The Swiss therapeutics products agency Swissmedic has started a review of another anti-Covid 19 vaccine – this time from United States biotech firm Moderna - in the rolling submission procedure. This is the third authorisation procedure submitted in Switzerland for a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. “The rolling submission procedure for mRNA-1273 is based on the initially submitted data packages on the preclinical situation and quality, as well as on preliminary clinical data. In a rolling review, the data can be evaluated as soon as they become available. The companies can then submit the latest data continuously without having to wait for the conclusive results from all studies,” Swissmedic said on FridayExternal link. Swissmedic can thus obtain an initial picture of the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine candidates before the authorisation studies are completed (Phase III studies). This accelerates the review process while at the same time “preserving the same level of careful checking of all requirements relating to safety, efficacy and quality”, it explained. The agency is already reviewing authorisation applications for Covid-19 vaccines from the companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech. On Wednesday Swiss government announced that it had earmarked an additional CHF100 million ($111 million) to buy an anti-Covid vaccine. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the aim was to provide a “safe and efficient product of high-quality” for the population in Switzerland. The allocation of funds comes on top of CHF300 million approved earlier this year. So far, Switzerland has assured reservations for about 13 million doses of prospective vaccines from AstraZeneca and Moderna and an international programme by the World Health OrganizationExternal link (WHO). It is also in negotiations with Pfizer/BioNTech about assuring delivery. Swissmedic has to examine and approve any product before it is distributed. Health officials estimate about 60-70% of the population must be inoculated against the new coronavirus to get the pandemic under control. Coronavirus infections in Switzerland rose by 6,739, the federal health authorities said on Friday. The death toll increased by 97.
2020-11-13;The Responsible Business Initiative’s orange revolution;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-responsible-business-initiative-s-orange-revolution/46150866;"Backers of the responsible business vote have been highly visual in spreading their message with flags, fliers and promotional materials. Is it a new way of doing direct democracy or mere colour? A visitor to Switzerland these days might be struck by a sense of orangeness. In towns and cities, orange flags hang from balconies and railings, triangular orange fliers are tied onto bicycle frames, orange stickers are taped onto backpacks. Even in the countryside, farmhouses and sheds carry big orange banners with the slogan “Konzernverantwortungsinitiative JA!” [Responsible Business Initiative YES!]. The initiative, which comes to vote on November 29, aims to make Swiss-based companies liable for rights abuses in their global supply chains. The flags especially are the visual centrepieces of a campaign which has taken the country by surprise, adding splashes of colour to neighbourhoods and making the people’s initiative one of the most visible of recent years. Government and parliament both oppose the idea, but latest polls suggest it could win. Would victory at the ballot box mean vindication for the flag-hanging phenomenon? Direct correlation is hard to measure. Rahel Ruch of the organising committee says 80,000 of the flags had been sent out by early November to “all parts of the country”, both rural and urban; for context, turnout in Swiss votes is usually around 2 million. With each unit costing CHF10 ($10.95) to produce and send out – they are free for people to order – it’s a fairly cheap way of achieving wide publicity. Their concrete impact is less clear. Some say the flags are mostly hung in neighbourhoods that are already likely to support such initiatives anyway. “Strangely, this territorial flag-displaying happens in areas where there’s nothing to be gained,” wroteExternal link one author in the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper recently. In a kind of real-world version of online echo-chambers, the flags might just highlight one’s “belonging” to a certain group or place, rather than change anybody else’s mind, the argument goes. Mark Balsiger, a political campaign specialist, agrees that more flags doesn’t necessarily mean more votes. They are a colourful “reminder” rather than a means of persuasion, he says. However, the length of time the flags have been visible – two or three years already, much longer than the usual couple of months in the lead up to a vote – means the initiative is firmly implanted in the public’s mind. This could help mobilise supporters to cast their ballot in the coming weeks. With the battle set to be tight, “turnout is crucial”, says Balsiger. Martin Kuenzi of the Enigma communications firm also says mere visibility is not enough, and that the second plank of any strategy is spurring people to actually vote. But he says the flags have done a fantastic job both of creating awareness and of building up a community of “fans”. This community is currently being contacted heavily by the campaign organisers, who will be giving them a last push to vote, Kuenzi says. He’s convinced the initiative will win. Regardless of the result, the flags seem to mark a new way of promoting an initiative: one in which supporters become campaigners, forming a vocal community around an issue. Such campaigns involve “energising a core of potential voters who have already made up their minds, so that they vote with added emotional vehemence,” as analyst Claude Longchamp wrote for swissinfo.ch in 2018. Longchamp says the flag trend started a few years ago with the Young Socialists, who used banners to compensate the fact that they hadn’t enough money to run traditional campaigns. Today it’s spreading, and a visitor to Bern or Zurich will see hanging from balconies the stripes of the “Glacier Initiative”, a proposal to reduce Switzerland’s net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The campaign for paternity leave also used a flag, as does an initiative to protect drinking water quality. “It gives us visibility that we don’t have to pay for”, says Sophie Fürst, head of the Glacier Initiative campaign team. Among various promotional articles offered on this initiative’s website are T-shirts, buttons, stickers and of course the flag, made up of blue-yellow-orange stripes framing a white Alpine vista (see below). “We wanted a positively coloured flag that people could take pleasure in hanging,” Fürst says. So far, they’ve sent out around 18,000. Taken at the extreme, the image of all initiatives and referendums posting out flags in future is an absurd one. Dozens of initiatives are launched each year in Switzerland; if each did it to the extent of the responsible business campaign, this would mean millions of issue-based banners strung up around the country. Marketer Martin Kuenzi reckons it doesn’t work for all topics anyway. It works for issues that “make people proud”, he says – issues which they feel good about showing off. For an initiative, the goal is to build a movement of “ambassadors” which spreads the word on your behalf. People have to buy into it as a community, he says; don’t expect avid supporters of tax reform to start waving flags around. Whether it could lead to polarisation or neighbourhood divisions is a bigger and vaguer question. So far, the responsible business debate has been a civil one, even if the proponents have been criticised for using doctored, and emotive, images on their vote posters (see below). But studiesExternal link have suggested that flags and symbols, while acting as a way to bring people together, can also create in-group out-group tensions. You don’t have to look far to see the tensions linked to national flags, for example. In Bern, at least, in an apartment building in the Länggasse district known to this journalist, low-level flag wars started earlier this spring. First, a painted sheet was hung from a balcony demanding that disadvantaged groups were not left out of efforts to curb the coronavirus. In summer, as attention turned to upcoming votes, one apartment then flagged its opposition to buying new fighter jets; a downstairs neighbour responded with a patriotic-looking Swiss standard. In the end, it all led to an old-fashioned administrative intervention: a letter from the landlord, informing residents that flags were no longer to adorn the facade. Political views have since moved back indoors."
2020-11-13;Study: public need more trust in Covid-19 apps;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/study--public-need-more-trust-in-covid-19-apps/46159666;Coronavirus smartphone apps need more trust from the public in order to be fully effective, Zurich researchers have warned. Governments need to do more to break the cycle of mistrust. In an article published in ScienceExternal link on Friday, the team from the federal technology institute ETH Zurich said many governments – including Switzerland’s with the SwissCovid app - had seen digital health technologies as a promising tool to address coronavirus disease, particularly digital contact tracing apps (DCT) that trace proximity to other devices and GPS-based apps that collect geolocation data. But most national DCT apps did not have the expected rate of uptake. “This can be attributed to a number of uncertainties regarding general awareness of DCT apps, privacy risks, and the actual effectiveness of DCT, as well as public attitudes toward a potentially pervasive form of digital surveillance,” the authors said. In the United States, Switzerland and Italy, the number of people who said they would download an app was between 55% and 70% in April and May. But the actual number of users has turned out to be mostly under 30%. National contact tracing apps were often rolled out without engaging the public in any phase of the process, the authors noted. “In democratic countries, this is likely to undermine trust in technological solutions, especially if they embody a pervasive surveillance logic that may well appear at odds with democratic ideals.” They recommend that the involvement of civil society representatives, advocacy groups, and non-governmental organisations in app oversight bodies. Public involvement should be seen as key to the adaption process, they argue. In Switzerland, the SwissCovid App has been downloaded by 2.7 million people but is only in active use by around 1.8 million people. In October epidemiologist Marcel Salathé, who led the development of the SwissCovid app, said Switzerland needed a major communications push to improve uptake of the app.
2020-11-20;Swiss stump up more cash to buy a Covid-19 vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-stump-up-more-cash-to-buy-a-covid-19-vaccine/46155560;The Swiss government has earmarked an additional CHF100 million ($111 million) to buy an anti-Covid vaccine. Interior Minister Alain Berset, who announced the news on Wednesday, said the aim was to provide a “safe and efficient product of high-quality” for the population in Switzerland. The allocation of funds comes on top of CHF300 million approved earlier this year. So far, Switzerland has assured reservations for about 13 million doses of prospective vaccines from two suppliers and an international programme by the World Health OrganizationExternal link. He added that several potential suppliers of the vaccine were considered, but it was not possible to say when a suitable product will be ready for distribution at some point next year. The government has already placed reservations for several million shots of vaccine from the British-Swedish firm, AstraZeneca, and from the United States pharma company Moderna. It is also in negotiations with Pfizer/Biontech and hopes to strike a deal for the delivery of another three million vaccines shortly. However, Berset cautioned that the national regulator Swissmedic, will have to examine and approve a product before it can be distributed. In a first phase, the government aims to immunise people with a health risk. Berset reiterated there were no plans to declare vaccinations mandatory across the country. Preparations coordinated by the armed forces are underway to organise the logistics for distributing the vaccines across the country when one or several products will be ready. “Our primary goal is to improve the current health situation,” he said at a news conference on Wednesday. Health officials estimate about 60-70% of the population must be inoculated against the new coronavirus to get the pandemic under control. Berset said the current infection figures in Switzerland remained “alarming” even as the number of confirmed daily cases has begun to stabilise over the past few days. On Wednesday, the Federal Office for Public Health reported 8,270 new cases of Covid-19 infections bringing the total number up to more than 243,000 cases. Berset said it was crucial to reduce the coronavirus reproduction rate well beyond 1 to prevent overburdening hospitals and health staff.
2020-10-20;Swiss teacher suspended after organising anti-mask demo;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-teacher-suspended-after-organising-anti-mask-demo/46153242;A school in central Switzerland has dismissed until further notice a primary school teacher who co-organised a demonstration against the wearing of masks. The woman did not wear a mask in school for health reasons. Confirming media reports, the board of the school in canton Nidwalden said in a statement on Tuesday that it respected the right to freedom of expression but the woman’s behaviour could lead to problems and conflict. The move comes as the Swiss debate whether masks should be worn in primary schools – for teachers and pupils. Since the beginning of November kindergarten and primary school teachers in Nidwalden have had to wear a mask to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The 39-year-old teacher had presented the school with a medical certificate in mid-October, which gave her a dispensation from wearing a mask. As a result, the board said the school had taken “extensive measures” to enable the teacher to continue teaching. However, parents were concerned that the woman had helped organise an anti-mask demo in September. These concerns – as well as ones about comments the teacher had made at the demo – were expressed to the school and, directly, to the teacher, who agreed that she would leave the school with immediate effect. “I don’t see my physical integrity being respected,” she told the Urner Zeitung. She said she didn’t feel well surrounded by masked, expressionless people, “and when I then put myself in the children’s shoes, I wonder how it’s affecting them”. Education is a cantonal issue in Switzerland. Masks have been obligatory in all Secondary II level schools, the level that follows obligatory education, since October 29. Some cantons have gone further, introducing masks at secondary I level (12-15) for pupils and teachers. Some cantons, like Zurich and Nidwalden, require staff to wear them in primary schools. Children under 12 remain exempt from wearing masks. Parents entering the school grounds also have to wear masks. Several experts have called for more widespread mask wearing at schools, including children in primary schools. Geneva virologist Isabella Eckerle, for example, has called for more testing and obligatory mask wearing for younger children at school as the number of classes in quarantine over coronavirus rises. “One should test [children] as much as adults. This is the only way that we can find out which measures are helpful to keep the infection numbers down, so that we can successfully get through the winter,” she said. The teacher in Nidwalden hopes to return to her job after everything returns to normal. A police summons for co-organising the demo is outstanding. 
2020-10-20;Apprenticeships ‘are coronavirus-crisis proof’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/apprenticeships--are-coronavirus-crisis-proof-/46152472;Vocational training has proven itself to be crisis-proof during the pandemic, the government’s special Covid-19 apprenticeship taskforce says. Nevertheless, the taskforce will be renewed for another year. In May the government set up a Taskforce “Perspective professional apprenticeships 2020”External link following concerns that young people were struggling to find vocational training places during the pandemic as companies tightened their belts. An additional challenge is that the spring shutdown made it harder for pupils to get support during the apprenticeship application process or attend interviews. The country’s much-admired dual-track apprenticeship systemExternal link sees young people combine on-the-job training in a company with lessons in a vocational school, producing a well-qualified workforce. It is considered one of Switzerland’s economic success factors. Around two-thirds of young people take the vocational route in Switzerland. Renewed mandate “The taskforce’s mandate has been renewed for a year to ensure that young people and companies also have good framework conditions on the apprenticeship market and for the transfer [from an apprenticeship] to the job market in 2021 as well,” the economics ministryExternal link, which holds the education portfolio, said in a statement on TuesdayExternal link. The group, which held a high-level meeting on Monday, is made up of representatives of the government, cantons (who are in charge of education matters in Switzerland) and social partners. A taskforce report found that extra efforts by training companies had helped shore up the apprenticeship market in 2020. Monthly cantonal monitoring has allowed the economics ministry to react and take measures early. Around 40 support projects have so far received government funding under the taskforce’s Apprenticeships Covid-19 programme. The good news: at the end of September around 76,500 apprenticeship contracts had been signed, a slight rise on last year. School-leavers usually sign contracts for apprenticeships that start in the first week of August. But new measures have pushed back the deadline to the end of October to allow young people more time to find an apprenticeship.
2020-09-20;Why Swiss participation in WHO’s Covid-19 vaccine plan matters ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/why-swiss-participation-in-who-s-covid-19-vaccine-plan-matters-/46140342;The second wave of coronavirus is making the race for viable vaccines even more urgent. In an unprecedented move, the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) this summer launched COVAX, a vaccine pool that aims to ensure equitable access for all countries.   Switzerland, which has also signed two bilateral deals with vaccine companies, seemed to hesitate in signing up but has done so. What is COVAX, and why is Swiss participation important?  Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), says Swiss participation is vital. Given its role as host country to the WHO and the Gavi Vaccine Alliance organisation, as well as co-chair (with Singapore) of the Friends of COVAXExternal link, “I personally feel that Switzerland was a little bit late in announcing its support for the COVAX Facility,” he told swissinfo.ch.   Switzerland was not on the WHO’s initial list on September 21 of countries that had signed up, causing a few raised eyebrows. However, it announcedExternal link a few days later that it had joined the vaccine pool. A spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told swissinfo.ch that the delay was due to the “signing process” and that Bern’s commitment is “firm”.  COVAX needs funding support if it is to work properly. And as well as showing international solidarity, experts agree that it is also in Switzerland’s self-interest to join. “I think it’s the right decision,” says Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. As a small country, Switzerland does not have the negotiating clout of high-income countries with large populations like the US, UK, Japan and the European Union, where “there may be a much bigger commercial interest for any individual vaccine company”. With COVAX “Switzerland has a channel through which to get access to a basket of vaccines for its national use”, she told swissinfo.ch.  But as a rich country, Switzerland has more influence than some other countries with small populations and has already signed two bilateral deals with vaccine companies. In August it announced a deal with US biotech firm Moderna to secure early access to 4.5 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine currently in development. The doses are to be produced in Switzerland through a partnership with Lonza. And in October it announced it had signed a deal with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to pre-order up to 5.3 million doses of another Covid-19 vaccine also under development.  A number of other countries have also been concluding bilateral deals, notably the US, which has not signed up to COVAX.   “We are working to advance treatments and therapies as a global public good – and backing efforts for a people’s vaccine available and affordable everywhere,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the UN General Assembly in September. “Yet some countries are reportedly making side deals exclusively for their own populations. Such ‘vaccinationalism’ is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe, until all of us are safe.”  The Swiss government says joining the COVAX initiative is a “complementary measure” to its bilateral deals.  It can be complementary, because no-one yet knows which vaccines will work, says Moon. Even if those being developed by Moderna and AstraZeneca pass the finishing line, Switzerland “may get access to other vaccines that might work better, or which may work better in different subgroups of the population”, she explains. “It is possible, for example, that one vaccine is proven to be safe and effective in younger adults and another is proven to be safer or more effective in older people.”  On the other hand, the risk is that vaccine companies that do bilateral deals might not provide vaccines, or enough vaccines to COVAX, she warns. “And I really hope the government is engaging in that kind of political advocacy, because what we really need is for all the big firms to agree to reserve a proportion of their supply for COVAX, for all the developing countries that cannot access the vaccine through bilateral muscle.”  Buying in to COVAX “gives you a pretty good assurance that you will have access to one or several vaccines that will work”, says Cueni of the IFPMA, which is also based in Geneva. “It is not an insurance policy. It is hedging your risk, because if you wait until you know which vaccines make it, you will have to wait until companies have serviced these bilateral deals.”  Switzerland is providing CHF20 million ($22 million) from development assistance in support of the initiative to provide vaccines to low-income countries. This is “part of a CHF400 million packageExternal link approved by the Federal Council for the global fight against the pandemic”, according to public health office FOPH.  Self-financing countries also have the option to contribute additional funds to a second COVAX “pot” to secure Covid-19 vaccines for their own populations. Asked if Switzerland is doing this, the FOPH told swissinfo.ch that “in September 2020, Switzerland confirmed its participation as a self-financing country in the COVAX initiative in order to procure vaccines for up to 20 percent of the population. The payment as a self-financing participant in the COVAX Facility will ultimately depend on the choice of vaccine(s)”.  Cueni says the IFPMA is an “actively engaged partner of the COVAX Facility”. There are multiple vaccine candidates in the pool, including some of its members. “With the leverage they have, I would expect that the Facility will be able to secure a very good price,” he told swissinfo.ch. “We as an industry cannot discuss individual prices or general price policy, but you have seen public statements from a number of large companies that during the pandemic they will work on a not-for-profit basis or socially responsible pricing.”   This sounds too good to be true. But Cueni says the Covid-19 pandemic is a unique global challenge, and there are high expectations on big pharma to help. “For pharma, it’s also about responding to this sense of responsibility,” he told swissinfo.ch. “But then there’s a second expectation that pharma doesn’t exploit this. This is a unique situation, it’s not the time to put profits before people.” 
2020-08-20;Third of Swiss prone to believe conspiracy theories;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/one-third-of-swiss-prone-to-believe-conspiracy-theories/46148992;A new study shows that about a third of Swiss have a mindset that makes them more likely to believe conspiracy theories. Experts warn that this increases in times of uncertainty such as Covid-19. On Saturday, several hundred people gathered in Basel to protest coronavirus measures. Many weren’t wearing masks in defiance of government laws mandating them. According to a SonntagsZeitung reporterExternal link on the scene, many were chanting slogans or holding signs talking about how masks cause harm or are useless. While many protestors simply resist government interference, some simply believe the coronavirus is a lie invented by the media or government. According to a studyExternal link published in September, about a third of Swiss are prone to such theories. A research team led by Dirk Baier, head of the Institute for Delinquency and Crime Prevention at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), studied the links between the likelihood of believing in conspiracy theories and violent extremism.   The team surveyed over 9,000 young people and 2,000 adults in 2019 (before the pandemic) for answers to questions such as whether there are secret organizations that have a great influence on political decisions or whether politicians are puppets for more powerful forces. The study found that a total of 31.4 % of adolescents and 35.9% of adults have a marked conspiracy mentality, making them more prone to believe conspiracy theories. The research also finds that distrust in institutions and feelings of powerlessness and insecurity increase this mentality. “If one looks for orientation in uncertain times, the simple - conspiracy theory – answers are welcomed,” said Baier in an interviewExternal link in SonntagsZeitung. About half of the study participants had no interest to engage politically and believe that it is pointless to do so. Baier found that about half of the study participants agree that everything has become more uncertain and one must be prepared for everything. 
2020-08-20;Swiss media on Biden win: ‘A signal far beyond American borders’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-media-on-biden-win---a-signal-far-beyond-american-borders-/46145858;Swiss media and politicians react to Joe Biden’s win, saying that he has his work cut out for him to bring the country together but he’s the right person to do it and to rebuild the country’s reputation abroad. Major US media networks have called it: Joe Biden will become the 46th President of the United States. After five days of ballot counting, Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes helped former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris secure the 270 votes needed to head to the White House. It wasn’t the landslide the Democratic party expected and hoped for, with Trump securing even more votes than in 2016. The narrow win over President Trump revealed how deeply divided the United States is and the challenges ahead. The President-elect will be tasked with bridging divides and healing a country that is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences. In response to the announcement, the Tages-Anzeiger wroteExternal link:“Joe Biden knows what suffering means. That's why he's the right president for a wounded America”. In an editorial, Meret Baumann from the Neue Zürcher Zeitung wroteExternal link that the win shows that the “majority of Americans are fed up with the lies and chaos in the White House . She added that it will take years to clean up the heap of rubble caused by Donald Trump. Biden faces acute crises while also addressing the damage Trump has done to the reputation of the US and its institutions, she added.  “This election is a signal far beyond American borders. It strengthens liberal democracy when the geopolitically and economically most powerful country with its great radiance is no longer ruled by an authoritarian demagogue.” Biden's success this time around was thanks in part to his tone and conviction to fight for the soul of the nation argued the Tages-Anzeiger. He always seemed “present” and “authentic” in the way he communicated with voters. On Sunday, the Swiss press recognised the role Kamala Harris - the first woman and first black woman - played in helping secure votes. Richard Werly at the French-language paper Le Temps wroteExternal link that this is also her victory. With her speech on Saturday, Harris confirmed her reputation as a fighter and her desire to lead by example, he wrote. Ultimately though, at 77 years old, Biden's candidacy was not about hope or the future of the Democratic party, the paper said. This was echoed by Baumann who argued that the win was less about Biden. It was also not a decision between different positions or political directions. “It was a referendum on the president.” She added that President Trump never tried to address those who rejected him and instead targeted his policies at his supporters, which “increased polarisation and destabilized the country by constantly stirring up chaos”. The narrow win should still prompt self-reflection by the Democratic party writesExternal link Martin Suter in the Tages-Anzeiger. Biden's political luck was the Covid 19 pandemic, in which Trump's communication skills failed miserably. In addition, a sufficient number of voters longed for an end to the turbulence that constantly raged around Trump.   Just after the announcement, President Trump said in a statement from his campaign that Biden is “rushing to falsely pose as the winner,” and called the race “far from over.” Beginning Monday, Trump's campaign said it would start prosecuting its case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated.  I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands, Trump said in the statement. In response, Valérie de Graffenried wroteExternal link in Le Temps that by seeking to discredit the electoral process, the outgoing president once again demonstrated his contempt for democratic institutions. His attempts to steal the victory from Joe Biden and fuel conspiracy theories is “dangerous and irresponsible”. Andrea Caroni from the centre-right Radical Liberal party told Keystone-SDA that the election showed the strength of American democracy in that it is capable of defending itself against a system breaker , a sower of division , such as Donald Trump.  It's unclear what a Biden presidency means for Switzerland. Simonetta Sommaruga who holds the rotating Swiss presidency congratulated Biden and Harris and said that it represented a strong signal . Jan Atteslander from the business association economiesuisse told Keystone-SDA on Saturday that he doesn't believe the election of Joe Biden will dramatically change economic relations between the two countries. However, he is interested to see if the Democrat is able to unblock the situation with international trade, which is very important to Switzerland as an export-heavy country. Although Switzerland suffered from US tariffs placed on steel and aluminum, Swiss exports rose during Trump’s term. What the election means for negotiations on a free trade agreement between the two countries is unclear. There have been several attempts to restart negotiations but progress has been slow. Martin Naville, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, toldExternal link the NZZ that he wasn't optimistic that a Swiss trade deal will be on the top of the Biden agenda. However, it will depend on who he appoints in the administration. Switzerland has excellent contacts with the current government, he said, noting visits by several top Trump officials in the last few years.  There is no one among the Democrats who advocates for free trade. He added that Swiss pharmaceutical companies may be the most affected if Biden pushes to lower drug prices. Swiss parliamentarian Charles Juillard from the Christian Democratic Party told Keystone-SDA that “this is a nice surprise for the US and the world”. Trump has not been a fan of multilateralism – something that Switzerland holds in high regard. How Biden chooses to move forward with multilateral institutions will be of great interest to Switzerland, which serves as host to the the World Health Organisation and the European Headquarters of the UN.  Carlo Sommaruga told Keystone-SDA that Joe Biden's election is extremely important for the world. He has clearly expressed his commitment to multilateralism, an essential platform for the peaceful functioning of our planet, said the Socialist Democratic Party parliamentarian. Juillard said that he hopes that the US will consider changing its climate change politics. Last week, the US formally pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
2020-08-20;Covid-19 science taskforce rejects accusations of alarmism;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-science-taskforce-rejects-accusations-of-alarmism/46148788;The Covid-19 science taskforce has said it stands by estimates that Switzerland’s intensive care units could reach capacity if new Covid-19 infections don’t drop dramatically in the next few weeks. In an interviewExternal link in the Sonntagszeitung, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, a member of the National Covid-19 Science Taskforce, said that the forecasts were not alarmist overestimates. “If you add 100 or 200 beds to the bed capacity, it will only take a few days longer for the hospitals to reach their limits,” he said. On October 23, Martin Ackermann, who heads the Covid-19 science taskforce, said they estimated that the capacity limit in intensive care in hospitals would be reached between end of October and November 9 if the situation didn’t improve. At the time, Switzerland reported 6,634 new cases. Bonhoeffer explains that “the forecasts of October 23 were based on the assumption that non-emergency interventions would not be postponed”. As some hospitals have rescheduled procedures, the doubling time slowed from 7 to 8.6 days. In response to changes, the taskforce adjusted the forecasts and declared last Friday that the upper limit of 1,400 beds would be reached by November 13 to 19 if nothing is done to bring down the cases.  New infections have surged in Switzerland in the last two weeks reaching over 10,000 a couple days last week. On Saturday, statistics compiled by the World Health Organisation revealed that six cantons in Switzerland are among the top 12 regions for Covid-19 infections in Europe. Geneva tops the list with 13,965 new infections in the last 14 days. On Thursday, some hard-hit hospitals started transferring some intensive care coronavirus patients from French-speaking part of the country to German-speaking regions that have more space. The government has also deployed the army to provide support to hospital staff in Geneva among other cantons. The federal government put in place stricter measures in late October to deal with the rising cases but has resisted some form of lockdown despite calls from some epidemiologists in the country. Some cantons including Geneva, Vaud, Valais and Jura have opted for semi-confinement in which bars, restaurants and non-essential shops are closed. Last weekend, the Health minister already warned that large family gatherings and parties will likely be difficult over the holidays. “I don’t know if we can save Christmas,” Berset told Le Matin DimancheExternal link. “We have to live with this uncertainty.” Over the weekend, several hundred people gathered in Basel to protest against the Covid-19 measures. Political protests are allowed provided people wear masks. Keystone-SDA reported that very few protestors were wearing masks and that around 80 people were questioned by authorities. One of the protestors claimed to say that the country was turning into a “health dictatorship” while another said that this “masked history was a crime against humanity.
2020-08-20;From an asylum centre to a Swiss university;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/from-an-asylum-centre-to-a-swiss-university/46142396;Higher education offers a window of opportunity for refugees in Switzerland but it’s not easy to get through - and the Covid-19 pandemic has made it harder. But Chechen native Dagun Deniev has succeeded. Literature studies and writing have been a spiritual refuge since the Geneva University student arrived in Switzerland in December 2010 as a 17-year-old boy in search of political asylum. My mother was involved in human rights activities. She was arrested twice. We lived in fear 24 hours a day, Deniev explained. After applying to the Vallorbe refugee centre, the family was sent to Geneva. Here, Deniev lived in refugee centres and had a short stay in an immigration detention centre before an attempted deportation. The young man, who looks younger than his 28 years, began by learning French and was able to start his Bachelors degree in 2014. He is currently doing a Masters in Russian Literature. Our first meeting takes place in the university library - just one day before the national lockdown in March. When I asked, 'Dagun, how are your studies going?' he just laughs, saying he has no other choice. Over the years, education has been his lifeline. No statistics are kept on how many refugees and asylum seekers are studying at Swiss universities. You are eligible if you have a residence permit N (asylum seeker) or F (temporary residence permit for refugees). But there are no tuition discounts and no special treatment for admissions, as universities set the same requirements for all foreign applicants. Two-thirds of refugees who want information on studying need some help, said Martina von Arx from the refugee information platform Perspectives StudiesExternal link. According to von Arx, someone may be “out of luck” with their place of residence. This is because the Swiss asylum system distributes applicants among the 26 cantons and each has slightly different procedures for language training, access to social assistance and information. Many refugees are also struggling with getting their diplomas recognised, funding their studies and the scarcity of the language courses available, as has been noted by nccr- on the moveExternal link, the National Centre of Competence in Research for migration and mobility studies and other sourcesExternal link. But this does not seem to dampen their desire to study. When the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) opened to refugees in 2016, 120 people immediately applied for 40 vacancies, the newspaper Le TempsExternal link reported at the time. In the same article, University of Geneva rector Yves Flückiger said that accepting refugees was more than just academic education and support for integration: the main thing is that this project allows students to see a future”. However, the academic path also requires strong self-discipline, as Deniev well knows. Hostel conditions are difficult. There were four of us in a small 16-square-metre room that had bunk beds, a wash basin, refrigerator and four metal cabinets. It was noisy, and I couldn’t even sit down with a book at the dirty and cluttered table. It was impossible to study under such conditions, so I spent most of my time in the library.” Studying distracted him from what looked like a shaky future, which saw the family’s asylum request rejected in 2011, and again in 2013, on appeal. Rejected asylum seekers were sent to the notorious Foyer de Tattes centre in Geneva (in 2014 a man died and several were injured after a fight and fire there). He and his mother were moved into different buildings: Deniev’s was a male housing unit supervised round the clock by security guards. They lived there for three years. In late 2016 Deniev was arrested and placed in an administrative detention unit for 20 days while awaiting deportation on a special flight to Russia. “I lost sleep and almost my mind,” he recalled. His mother and student friends sounded the alarmExternal link and the Geneva media became interested in the case. While I was behind bars, a support committee took up my cause and several demonstrations were held in my favour. My teachers visited me in prison. My lawyer brought me many support notes. I am so grateful for that, he said. The canton of Geneva cancelled his deportation. But Deniev’s legal status was still problematic, so the University of Geneva fortunately put him in contact with an immigration lawyer. Switzerland continued to process asylum applications and expel rejected asylum seekers during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. At the end of March, Deniev went to Bern for another interview at the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) for his asylum process. When he returned to Geneva, he found out that the university had cancelled on-site classes as part of its pandemic measures. Distance learning requires good access to the internet and a quiet and safe place to study, both rare commodities in refugee centres, Computers also have to be disinfected after use. But the autumn semester brought another big change: Deniev has been granted a F temporary residence permit and is now allowed to work to support his studies. Lawyer Delphine Poussin from the Geneva office of Etter & Buser has represented Deniev since December 2016 on the recommendation of the university. As she explained by email, the case was extremely complex and took four years of fighting before he finally received a temporary residence permit”. She said that her client deserved this great victory but she doesn’t think “that the fact that he is a student played a role for migration authorities”. Sanctuary is granted to a person based on whether he or she will be persecuted at home, and not on personal merits . Deniev now lives in a student residence - modestly, but with more comfort than in a refugee centre. Mum comes to see me every day just to rest. She goes to language courses for women, but it’s hard as she is 65 years old and it is difficult to learn new things, he said. The student is also a published author, having written the novel “Carnets d'un requérant d'asile déboutéExternal link” (Notebooks from a rejected asylum seekers) about his experiences. A collection of stories in Russian were previously long listed for a Russian literary prize in 2009.
2020-08-20;Why Swiss businesses oppose plans for corporate liability;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/why-swiss-business-is-against-the--corporate-responsibility--initiative/46137670;The Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse) is leading the opposition against plans which aim to make Swiss companies accountable for business activities abroad. In an interview with swissinfo.ch, Monika Rühl, the CEO of economiesuisse, warns that the people’s initiative would put Swiss companies, already weakened by the pandemic, in great difficulty. The business federation is the umbrella organisation made up of more than 120 associations and trade chambers. Under the proposal – to come to a nationwide vote on November 29 – the Swiss constitution will be amended by an article to ensure that companies based in Switzerland and the companies they control respect human rights and environmental standards also abroad. Parliament has drawn up a counter-proposal, which will enter into force if the initiative is rejected at the ballot box. This legal amendment provides for reporting obligations on environmental, human rights and corruption issues. It also imposes duties of care in the area of child labour and minerals extracted in conflict zones. However, there are no new rules on corporate liability. swissinfo.ch: You say this initiative is an ‘experiment’ that has no equivalent anywhere in the world. How does it differ from regulations in other countries? Monika Rühl: The initiative is based on a combination of three instruments: a comprehensive accountability for the respect of human rights, environmental standards and business relationships. [Second], liability for misconduct by foreign companies in their economic relations with Swiss companies, and [third], a reversal of the burden of proof. This means that in the event of damage caused by a third party abroad, the Swiss company could be subject to a complaint in Switzerland and would have to demonstrate that it has analysed and monitored all of its business partners without error. Liability for third party fault with a reversal of the burden of proof is not known either at the international level or in France, even though French legislation is one of the most demanding in the world. swissinfo.ch: What would be the consequences of accepting this initiative for Swiss companies? M.R: This would involve excessive costs to carry out this due diligence, which covers all business relationships, at a time when Swiss companies are already in great difficulty with the coronavirus crisis. There is also a risk of compensation claims being filed in Switzerland for the misconduct of foreign companies abroad, which could lead to blackmail in court, particularly in countries where all-out attacks are permitted between competing companies. Complaints against Swiss companies would have a negative impact on Switzerland as a business location and tarnish the image of our companies. Those who would benefit would be lawyers specialising in such cases and competing companies. swissinfo.ch: Since the complaints would only concern violations of human rights and environmental standards, do you really think that a lot of procedures would be launched? M.R.: The initiative promoters seek to destabilise Swiss companies to some extent. If you are ill-intentioned, you don't necessarily sue to win but to damage a company's image. These court proceedings can last for years, and even if a company is found innocent, its reputation will already have been damaged. swissinfo.ch: You argue that the initiative would be counterproductive in developing countries. What are the reasons for this? M.R.: Swiss companies, also through their direct investments, create two million jobs worldwide, a third of which are in developing and transition countries. Numerous studies show that the best way out of poverty is to have a job. However, if Swiss companies were to consider that the risks associated with their activities in these markets are too high, they could decide to withdraw from these countries and the local population would suffer, as a result of job cuts. swissinfo.ch: How can we ensure that Swiss companies respect the environment and human rights abroad? M.R.: We share the concern of the initiative group: Swiss companies must respect the environment and human rights. But we do not agree on the means. Companies are already acting very responsibly and addressing problems in a constructive manner. We believe that it is easier to find solutions through dialogue than through complaints in court. If the initiative is rejected, the counter-proposal would automatically be implemented. This would also advance the cause of the initiative promoters, without introducing risks for third-party practices that Swiss companies may not be able to control. The counter-proposal introduces new duties of due diligence as well as an obligation of transparency in several areas. It is a modern and binding piece of legislation that would make Switzerland a pioneering country. swissinfo.ch: Do you have two concrete examples of how Swiss companies are trying to be more responsible abroad? M.R.: Swiss companies are very active around the world, for example in eradicating child labour in cocoa farming or in taking measures in collaboration with local NGOs or gold refiners to ensure respect for human rights in certain artisanal mines. swissinfo.ch: In the absence of binding measures, don't you think there will always be companies that prefer to make a maximum profit and turn a blind eye to environmental destruction and human rights violations? M.R.: Swiss companies do not operate in a legal vacuum. A company operating abroad must comply with the binding legislation of that country as well as with international obligations. If, for example, a Swiss company violates Indian law, it will have to justify itself before Indian courts. Following the logic of the initiative, we have the arrogance to claim that Swiss law and Swiss courts should have the upper hand over local legislation. While other countries are just as sovereign as we are, we are not. Text adapted from French/urs
2020-07-20;Switzerland anxiously watches tight US election;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-anxiously-watches-knife-edge-us-election/46139766;The landslide the Democrats expected did not happen, leaving US voters and the rest of the world anxiously waiting for all the votes to be counted. The fight for the US presidency has developed into a veritable electoral thriller, wrote Swiss public television, SRF, on Wednesday afternoon after watching the votes tally up across the United States. Four days after Election Day and it is down to four states – Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona - to decide who will secure the coveted 270 electoral college votes needed to make it to the White House. A tight race and an unusually high number of mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic have meant long hours for vote counters in many counties, and a longer than usual wait before a clear outcome. Biden is ahead in both Pennsylvania and Georgia thanks to the high number of mail-in ballots cast in urban areas like Philadelphia and Atlanta. As the mail-in votes prove more favorable to Biden, President Trump has stepped up attacks on the voting process, claiming major fraud and that the Biden camp is trying to steal the election. His campaign has launched a series of lawsuits across battleground states and has vowed that it will take the case to the Supreme Court. This has prompted reactions in Switzerland from confusion and surprise to fatigue and ridicule. The Swiss have their eyes glued to the electoral map not only because of the impact it could have on the world but also because the pure spectacle of it all is keeping everyone on the edge of their seats. In the German-language paper Tages-Anzeiger on Friday evening Arthur Rutishauser wroteExternal link that the show is over.   “When will America finally come to its senses, when will this nightmare finally be over? This is probably what most of the people in Switzerland who are now looking at America are wondering.” Trump’s reactions to the vote appeared as validation that someone who “produces scandals on a daily basis” and “pours fuel on the fire, can no longer be the most powerful man in the world,” wrote Rutishauser. He asks how is it that “many Americans are not ashamed of Trump, but rather still love him today, while Biden hardly inspires anyone. How can that be?” The answer, he writes, is the economy. Malika Nedir echoed this in an editorialExternal link in the French-language paper La Tribune de Genève earlier in the week, where she wrote that even if Trump doesn’t win, he still showed that half the country believes that they are better off after four years with him as president. “They are convinced that the energy and optimism of the president are more useful to the country than the return to decency and appeasement promised by Joe Biden.” In an opinion pieceExternal link on Wednesday, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung called the President's claims that the election has been stolen irresponsible and dangerous and that they undermine trust in the legitimacy of a process that is going exactly as predicted. On Thursday, Christof Münger in the Tages-Anzeiger argued that Donald Trump’s actions are a “fatal signal to democracies around the world”. He said his actions had the “audacity of an autocrat”. US democracy has been a shining example around the world, Münger wroteExternal link. “Should Trump win in the end, a politician who mocks democracy will continue to rule with the democratic seal of approval - the great irony of this election.” A group of around 20 Americans living in Switzerland gathered in Zurich on Saturday for a rally with the Democrats Abroad association. According to a member of the group, they wanted to show support for the democratic process and that all votes be counted. Whether US democracy will endure, and there will be a peaceful end to the election are questions preoccupying Swiss media. Swiss public television, SRF, US correspondent Isabelle Jacobi wroteExternal link that “In the end, it is hoped, there will be a winner and a loser, and US democracy will pass the 2020 stress test.” In an interviewExternal link with the German language paper Tages-Anzeiger, Josef Dittli, the only Swiss election observer of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the US election, said that he was concerned that President Trump was igniting a dangerous spark with some of his statements and that this could lead to riots. The fact that the race was so tight means that whoever wins the election has the difficult task of bringing together a polarised country. Jacobi added that “there won’t be a happy ending to this story because half of US voters will feel betrayed whoever wins. In the oldest democracy in the world, the democratic majority principle is apparently no longer sacrosanct.” It's unclear what a Biden presidency could mean for Switzerland. The country can’t complain about a lack of attention over the last four years. President Trump visited the country twice for the World Economic Forum in Davos and Ueli Maurer, who held the rotating Swiss presidency last year, was welcomed at the White House, the first time for a Swiss president. Although a free trade agreement wasn’t signed and Switzerland suffered from tariffs placed on steel and aluminum, Swiss exports rose during Trump’s term. The country also solidified its special role as representing US interests in Iran. Trump has not been a fan of multilateralism – something that Switzerland holds in high regard. If Biden becomes the next president, the French-language paperExternal link Le Temps writes that in 2021, Washington will look again to the European continent with a focus on restoring confidence”.
2020-06-20;Embattled Swiss Railways gets multilingual boost;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/embattled-swiss-railways-gets-multilingual-boost/46146162;Swiss Federal Railways has been awarded a prize recognising the multilingual abilities of its staff. In an award ceremony at the Lucerne transport museum on Friday, the Oertli Foundation hailed the ability of Federal RailwaysExternal link staff to switch languages as a train travels across different parts of Switzerland, and to address passengers in their own language or in English. In this way, it said, multilingual Switzerland is lived daily on the train. The Foundation’s 2020 prize consists of CHF30,000 ($33,000) for Swiss Railways staff training. It aims to help the transport company continue developing its training model in languages. Swiss Railways director general Vincent Ducrot said his company was proud of the award and that it shows “Swiss Railways wants not only to link the regions of Switzerland but also to build bridges between different linguistic cultures”. The Oertli FoundationExternal link, founded in 1967, encourages mutual comprehension and exchange between Switzerland’s four different language regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. This may help boost Swiss Railways morale as it faces falling revenues External linkdue to the coronavirus pandemic.
2020-02-20;Swiss universities say they are better prepared for second wave;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-universities-say-they-are-better-prepared-for-second-wave/46135736;" Universities and other higher education institutions went back to online teaching on Monday under nationwide Covid-19 rules set down by the government. This is the second time universities have stopped in-person classes after the lockdown in spring. Schools are remaining open under the latest measures announced last Wednesday. This time, universities say they are well prepared for distance learning, having been able to build on their experiences earlier this year, when they had to get online quickly. Only a few events in small groups or seminars will take place on campus, saidExternal link Karin Hiltwein, Secretary General and head of the corona crisis team at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, based in Windisch, canton Aargau. Laboratory work and music lessons are still taking place, she said, and are “of course keeping to protection measures” such as mask wearing and social distancing. The University of Bern started to reduce on-site teaching around two weeks ago. The institution expects the situation to continue long-term (there is no end date to the current national regulations). Exam procedures will have to be adapted. “We have to prepare clever exams that are not just based on banal knowledge retrieval,” vice-rector Bruno Morettti told Swiss public broadcaster SRF. Students have more access to help tools at home. Some courses might suffer “complications” as they are not meant to be undertaken online, added Marc Meyer, dean of Studies and Academic Affairs at the University of St Gallen. But “lecturers are doing their utmost to make the impossible possible,” he told SRF. There is no alternative to online learning at the moment; students need to complete their courses and do their exams, Meyer said. Widespread breakouts of Covid-19 at universities – as seen in the United Kingdom or the United States, for example – have so far been relatively rare in Switzerland. The highest profile example was when undergraduate students at the École Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL), one of the most prestigious hospitality management schools in the world, were placed in quarantine on September 23 after several coronavirus outbreaks. Some have raised concerns about a second period of distance learning. Yves Flückiger, president of the umbrella group swissuniversities, said that institutions expected gaps in learning, student isolation and problems in research as a result. He told the NZZ newspaperExternal link last week that universities had to do everything in their power to maintain educational quality."
2020-01-20;Geneva introduces partial lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-introduces-partial-lockdown/46134304;"Faced with the worsening Covid-19 situation, canton Geneva will enter a state of semi-confinement from 7pm on Monday. Bars, restaurants and non-essential shops will be closed; schools will remain open. Cinemas, museums, concert halls, gyms, swimming pools and ice rinks are also affected by these closures, the cantonal government said in a statementExternal link on Sunday. Nightclubs had already been forced to close. Take-aways and home delivery remain allowed. These measures will remain in effect until November 29. Hairdressers, beauty salons and tattooists are also affected. Day nurseries and schools will remain open. The cantonal government reminded people that gatherings of more than five people in public spaces, particularly in public squares, busy walkways, parks and near bodies water were banned. Also banned were public and private events involving more than five people, both inside and outside, including within the family circle. Exceptions include households of more than five people, weddings of up to five persons and funerals of up to 50 people. In its statement it said canton Geneva was facing an outbreak of cases and hospitalisations due to Covid-19. “On November 1, 474 people are being treated by the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), including 56 in intensive care beds (intensive and intermediate care). As a reminder, in mid-October, the HUG had 78 hospitalisations, including 13 in intensive care beds,” it said. “The figures show that the situation is severely worsening. Over the past few days, more than 1,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a daily basis (peaking at 1,338 positive cases on October 30).”"
2020-01-20;Police treat radicalised Covid deniers like Islamists;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/police-treat-radicalised-covid-deniers-like-islamists/46134038;Violent threats from coronavirus sceptics and opponents of government measures to combat the pandemic are increasingly occupying the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol). The authorities have warned such people that they are under surveillance. “The increasing readiness for violence in the coronavirus denial scene is a major concern for us,” said Fedpol spokesman Florian Näf in the SonntagsBlickExternal link. “It’s alarming.” Fedpol was currently seeing a significant increase in “expressions of displeasure”, including threats, Näf said. These were mainly directed at the Federal Office of Public Health and at politicians at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. “In recent months protective measures for individuals have had to be reassessed and strengthened,” he confirmed. The SonntagsBlick said the government would not give any details, but this is thought to refer to Health Minister Alain Berset in particular. The paper says the government, in cooperation with cantonal police forces, holds “at-risk conversations” with potential violent criminals. The police visit such a person, assess their risk and make it clear that they are being watched. This method has proven its worth with radicalised Islamists, according to the SonntagsBlick. Normally there are several hundred cases of such reports per year, which are sent by email to members of the federal parliament or to members of the authorities, Fedpol spokeswoman Cathy Maret told news agency Keystone-SDA/ATS. This year, she said, there had already been more than 1,000 such reports. About 40 were directly related to the Covid pandemic.
2020-01-20;Why two Swiss-led data models predict a Trump win;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/why-two-swiss-led-data-models-predict-a-trump-win/46131826;"Two teams of researchers in Switzerland say their data models based on search frequency and speech analysis forecast a win for Republican President Donald Trump in the US elections on Tuesday. Both teams’ models predicted Trump’s 2016 victory. What’s behind their approaches? The teams’ outlooks for the 2020 presidential race stand at odds with widespread pollingExternal link that shows the Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, out in frontExternal link generally by significant margins. One team used internet and social media searches to gauge interest in the candidate. The other team tweaked an established forecasting system, which is based on economic data and incumbency, by also evaluating a candidate’s charisma. “I did feel, seriously, like an idiot being about the sole person on the planet, perhaps one or two other research teams, that also said they think Trump would win [in 2016],” says John Antonakis, professor of organisational behavior at the University of Lausanne. Antonakis, together with Philippe Jacquart, professor at Emlyon business school in France, predicted the election based on the candidate’s charisma. “I really thought that we had gotten something fundamentally wrong.” Both groups of researchers say polling, the traditional questioning of likely voters, faces several hurdles in gaining an accurate picture of the electorate. They cite several issues, including difficulty in contacting a representative sample of voters because of the move from land lines to mobile phones; the fact that responders may not answer truthfully; and the fact that people who are polled may not vote.  “These are serious statisticians,” Antonakis says of the pollsters, “but they have a very wicked problem to solve.” Christoph Glauser, a mass media and political scientist, says he began to note the challenges in getting reliable poll data at least 15 years ago. He is the founder of the Institute for Applied Argumentation ResearchExternal link, IFAAR, a private research facility in Bern that creates computer-based systems for analysing digital media and online content. Glauser, his research assistant Loris Schmid and Jacques Savoy, a professor of computer science at the University of Neuchâtel, led a team of scientists, economists, IT and data specialists and psychologists to develop a method of candidate evaluation based on internet searches and social media reach. Unreliable polling “is why we started to develop API's (application programming interfaces) for analysing what users do on the Internet in terms of searches,” he says. “These are small software packages that analyse, for example, what people really search for on  Google, Twitter and Facebook.” The researchers’ servers crawl the internet collecting untold amounts of Web search, eCommerce and social media data from 247 million active internet users in the United States. They also collect data on the candidates worldwide. Glauser says that data for the 2020 election analysis came from 367 channels, including search engines, social media, and eCommerce sites, in the United States as well as 14,103 channels outside the country. Along with searches for both candidates, the team tracked more than 2,500 issues that people may be interested in, such as gun control, Black Lives Matter, the Supreme Court and coronavirus. “The [search volume for a candidate] gives you an idea of how strong the campaign is,” Glauser says. “We are kind of living in an attention economy. If you have the attention, and you also get the active feedback of the users, you are likely to be more present in the minds of the voters.” The searches don’t reveal whether the information is for or against a candidate, or whether it’s used for research purposes rather than pure interest. But for Glauser, the correlation with favorability is in the search volumes. “When you have big, big data sets like we have, from all the [relevant] channels, then you can identify trends and that makes it easier to make predictions,” he says. The team measured average monthly search volume across all US channels and found that Trump hovered around 70 million searches for most of the campaign. He reached more than 100 million with his tweet revealing that he’d tested positive for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Biden’s peak volume reached just 26.6 million in September. Five days from the election, Glauser says both campaigns have increased their search volume, but not in ways that would change his team’s prediction of a Trump victory. The project also evaluated Twitter engagement. This was Glauser’s research partner, Savoy’s, particular interest as his focus is on linguistics and political speech, specifically in the United States because of the country’s worldwide influence.   Typically, Savoy would analyse written and oral forms of political speech, but Twitter poses new challenges. “It’s not the written form, it’s less formal,” Savoy says. “But it’s not the oral form. So, it’s something in between.” He found that Trump and his team were able to send 43 tweets per day compared with 11 tweets per day for Biden. Trump outpaces him significantly in followers as well, with 87 million followers compared with about 11 million for Biden. “When Donald Trump sends a tweet, it’s clearly more visible,” Savoy says. “So that’s the second source (along with Internet searches) that is specifying, yes, it’s more frequent to see arguments in favor of Donald Trump on the social network. … Is this really going to correspond to voters? That is an open question.” Glauser has been developing his method for about 20 years, using it to evaluate some 50 elections worldwide, he says. He began making predictions three years ago and has since called about 10 elections. His predictions, when comparing percentage of vote share a candidate receives to the percentage of search volume, tracks closely with the result, usually within 1 percent to 5 percent, he says, while polls have been much farther from the result, sometimes as high as 40 percent. The second Swiss-led research team, Antonakis and Jacquart, developed a computer programme to evaluate a candidate’s charisma – how appealing the person is to voters on a personal level. During Antonakis’ time at Yale University, he learned of a prediction model developed by Yale economist Ray FairExternal link. The Fair model for predicting US presidential elections says that incumbents have an advantage, that voters will become fatigued with a political party after two four-year terms in office, and that an incumbent will be judged on the strength or weakness of the economy. But it was missing something, Antonakis says. “This model ignores the differences between the two candidates,” he says. “It's assumed that each party has put the most competent person forward.”  Research has suggested that voters will judge a candidate’s competence by their face, he says. But Antonakis couldn’t accept that the fate of governance rested on a person’s looksExternal link. So, he explored the idea of charisma and developed a charismometer: an objective means of analysing a candidate’s speech for a set of charismatic traits. Charisma is important, he says, because it signals values and strengths to potential followers and it signals a possible threat to the opposing side. In Antonakis’ model, the candidate’s charisma rating is factored in with the traditional Fair model to predict a candidate’s outcomeExternal link. According to Antonakis, while Trump has an advantage as the incumbent, tough economic expectations this year because of the coronavirus pandemic are giving Biden a slight advantage in the Fair model. But Trump has more charisma, according to Antonakis’ model, and comes out as the favourite there. The charismometer correctly called the 2012 and 2016 elections before the vote. And when the researchers applied the method to past elections, the model correctly predicted 20 out of 24 elections. Antonakis says the only thing that would affect his prediction of a Trump victory would be particularly bad US economic numbers released before the election. As of October 29, GDP figures matched expectations. Antonakis is quick to point out that charisma is subjective and relative to a speaker’s audience. For instance, former President Barack Obama would likely be considered charismatic by members of the Democratic party but not by members of the Republican party. That’s because a person is often judged charismatic if his or her values align with those of the audience. The charismometer attempts to remove that value judgement and determine charisma according to Antonakis’ definition: “symbolic, emotional, and value-based leader signaling.” “I want the machine to tell me, irrespective of my values, is this person charismatic or not?” Antonakis says. The charismometer evaluates speech based on nine elements, including identifying and expressing confidence in goals, using three-part lists, speaking in metaphors and stories, and posing rhetorical questions.  To evaluate a candidate, Antonakis can copy a speech and paste it into a field on the computer screen. The programme then rates each sentence of the speech based on each of the nine elements. Then, it calculates the probability that the speaker is charismatic. For example, based on Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address given in 1863, the programme gave an 80% probability that Lincoln was charismatic. In candidate acceptance speeches for the presidential nomination between 1916 and 2016, there was on average a 30% probability that the candidate was charismatic.  Trump’s acceptance speech rated him at 55.6% while Biden’s was 52%. However, Antonakis says there’s a caveat – which will be the ultimate determining factor on November 3.  “The point is, does the person who is communicating this way galvanise the party base to come and vote?”"
2020-01-20;Swiss minister: ‘I don’t know if we can save Christmas’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-minister---i-don-t-know-if-we-can-save-christmas-/46133930;Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset has refused to say when he thinks the Covid-19 crisis will end and has again called on everyone to do their part. He has also rejected criticism that he has favoured the economy over health. “I don’t know if we can save Christmas,” Berset told Le Matin DimancheExternal link. “We have to live with this uncertainty.” He said he wasn’t going to predict an end to the crisis, because “everyone who has done so has been wrong”. Asked why Switzerland had not resorted to a lockdown, he said that without the support of the population the measures were useless. “So we’re trying not to ban everything, but to appeal to people’s sense of responsibility.” Everybody knows how to prevent the spread of germs, he said, “but these measures will only work if everyone plays along”. A survey on WednesdayExternal link found that while Swiss citizens support tougher anti-coronavirus measures, their trust in the government has weakened over recent months. Critics who accused him of giving in to the economy and neglecting health were wrong, he said. “If there’s one thing this crisis has taught us, it’s that health and the economy can’t be set against each other.” When deciding on further measures, Berset said the burden on hospitals remained an essential factor. “We cannot afford to have the health system break,” he insisted. He also repeated his conviction that being able to manage the crisis in a regionally differentiated way was a “real advantage”. In separate Covid-related news on Sunday, before the start of the new ski season Swiss cable car companies have tightened the rules on wearing masks, according to the SonntagsZeitungExternal link. With immediate effect masks must be worn on all installations, including chair lifts and drag lifts. Previously this had been the case only for enclosed cable cars. Winter sports enthusiasts must also wear a face mask not only in closed waiting rooms but also when queuing outside. The SonntagsZeitung also reportedExternal link that mobility in Switzerland had fallen significantly since the middle of the week due to the tightened measures to contain the pandemic. Data from the company Intervista showed that whereas in mid-October the Swiss were still travelling around 20 kilometres a day, the average daily distance last Friday was 13.9 kilometres. The slowdown had become much more pronounced since the cantons announced that major events would be cancelled and the government on Wednesday restricted public events to 50 people and closed clubs and discos.

Ahead of this year’s presidential contest, we talked to them about what they found and learned along the way. During the 2016 election, the couple was living and working in New York. They could sense the stark divisions among the American population. In 2019, Braschler and Fischer went on a four-month road trip across the US, travelling through 40 states, passing through suburbs and housing projects, big cities and small towns. They converted their van into a mobile photo studio and invited people they met along the way to be photographed. swissinfo.ch: What inspired you to go on this journey? Monika Fischer & Mathias Braschler: The United States has captivated us for many years. We travel a lot for our work, but we haven’t spent this much time in any country besides our homeland, Switzerland. When we witnessed the election of Donald Trump in New York on November 8, 2016, we were as surprised as many Americans. How was it possible that a man like Trump was elected the 45th president? What had led so many people to elect a populist who had very few qualifications for this high office? We wanted to find out what moves people between New York and Los Angeles, what their concerns and hopes are. So we decided to explore the country once again to get a deeper insight into the soul of the United States.   swissinfo.ch: What draws you to the country? Fischer / Braschler: The nature as well as the cities are really beautiful! The fascination also lies in the contradictions of this nation, the extremes, the vastness, the openness and spontaneity of the people. Of course, it hasn't been true for a long time now that this is the land of unlimited possibilities, but when you want to do something, you’re free to pursue it. swissinfo.ch: How did you decide which people to ask to sit for portraits?  How many portraits have you done altogether? We only researched and arranged portraits with a few people ahead of time. They were people from the military, the navy, or public service. The other portraits were taken spontaneously during the trip. Of course, we took care to feature people from different backgrounds, regions, professions, and social classes. In total we made 115 portraits. swissinfo.ch: Was it difficult to get people in front of the camera and to get them to talk to you?   Fischer / Braschler: No, not at all, we received practically no cancellations. As soon as people realise that you are honestly interested in them, they are fully involved. Some of them talked about themselves for up to three hours.  swissinfo.ch: Have you / would you ever do a project like this in Switzerland? Fischer / Braschler: Yes, we did. We made a book called Die Schweizer - The Swiss. We also planned a road trip, but there you come up against certain limitations. In Switzerland it's completely different, there people are much more timid and have to pull out their schedules to arrange a portrait session ahead of time. As soon as an appointment is made, it doesn't have the same spontaneity anymore; people think about what to wear, what to say. Especially the women in Switzerland are reserved. There is a different kind of modesty, where they say Why are you asking me to do this? There are much more exciting people.” That doesn’t occur to Americans at all. swissinfo.ch: Back to the US - You decided to take your photos in a studio. Wouldn't it have been even more meaningful to show the people in their real surroundings? At work, in their homes, or on the street?  Fischer / Braschler: No, that's exactly what we didn't want. The intention was to visually democratise the people. As soon as you see them in their environment, for example in a small, untidy apartment, a different picture immediately emerges. We were concerned with the fact that everyone should be treated equally so that the viewer can concentrate on the person. swissinfo.ch: How did you react to people you met who thought differently than you, made racist statements, got particularly close to you or maybe needed help? Fischer / Braschler: We completely withdrew ourselves. We were spectators and listeners. This work is absolutely not about our point of view. We wanted to capture and portray exactly these extremes. swissinfo.ch: What social issues came up when you talked to people?  Fischer / Braschler: The nation’s deep division caused by the president is very much on people's minds. Both Trump opponents and supporters alike regret this division. People also work a lot and still have meagre incomes. The American Dream has given way to hopelessness. Drugs are a huge problem, which is completely underestimated [by observers] in Europe. Opioid addiction is incredibly widespread, it varies from region to region, but the extent of the problem is enormous. Homelessness has also increased dramatically. swissinfo.ch: Do you think that this division will deepen or do you have hope that people will become willing to talk to each other again? Mathias Braschler: That depends on what happens in the elections. If Donald Trump is re-elected, this division will deepen even more, since his policies are based on the sides playing off each other. I am quite sure that Trump will lose. He has angered so many centrist voters with his coronavirus policy. If Biden wins, he will work to soften this polarisation. For me, Biden is the right man for the job. Because he is a bit boring and moderate, he has this chance. swissinfo.ch: You have lived in New York and Switzerland for a long time. Now you have given up your apartment in the US. Do you miss it?  Monika Fischer: We had to give up our apartment because of coronavirus. At the moment nobody wants to live in New York and it is a good year to be in Switzerland. Our son Elias and I miss the city, for the first time we are living in a very rural area. Right now it only exists in our minds, because we can't travel there. Before, [when we were away], we knew that there was still the apartment in New York. Mathias Braschler: Right now I don't want to live in New York. I would immediately take a road trip through the country [though]. The vastness and openness are wonderful!  Divided we stand will be shown at the Stapferhaus Aarau until November 19 and at MASILugano until November 22. "
2020-10-31;Health workers need police protection at rally;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/health-workers-need-police-protection-for-demo/46133180;Around 1,000 people from the health sector demonstrated for better working conditions in Bern on Saturday. The police kept 100 opponents of the government’s Covid-19 measures behind barriers on the edge of Parliament Square. The Covid sceptics had gathered outside parliament shortly after noon for an unauthorised rally. They tried to disrupt the event by setting off firecrackers and chanting slogans. They ignored the obligation to wear masks, as well as the police request to make way for the authorised rally. They were eventually forced to the edge of the square by officers in combat gear. Saturday’s rally marked the end of a week of nationwide action by the “Health Alliance” of trade unions and professional associations. The health workers are demanding a wage increase and a coronavirus premium equivalent to one month’s salary, as well as more rights at work, more participation and better protection thanks to collective labour agreements. For the event on Parliament Square the organisers had worked out a protection concept for 1,000 participants. The obligation to wear masks and social distancing were strictly observed. Experts from various fields denounced the conditions in their industry. “During the first Covid-19 wave in spring we were often on duty around the clock,” said care worker Silvia Dragoi. “In order to be able to provide good care, we regularly undertake further training.” She added that further support measures were needed from the government. Laurentina Vais, a health expert, criticised the lack of recognition for people who give a lot physically and emotionally seven days a week. This leads to disappointment, professional withdrawal and exhaustion, she said. Under constant time pressure it’s not possible to provide patients with the care they need, said nursing expert Liridona Dizdari-Berisha. Emotional exhaustion was one reason why almost half of nursing staff leave the profession during their working lives, she said. “How about we clap for the military and put the CHF18 billion into healthcare,” was written on one placard.
2020-10-30;Public support for government falls as Covid numbers rise;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/public-support-for-swiss-government-falls-as-covid-numbers-rise-/46130950;Swiss citizens support tougher anti-coronavirus measures, but their trust in the government has weakened over recent months, a new survey has found.  At the end of October, only 37% of people surveyed had strong or very strong trust in the government’s handling of the crisis, compared with 66% in June and 67% back in April. This is according to the latest survey by the Sotomo research instituteExternal link for the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation,  swissinfo.ch's parent company, published on Friday. On the other hand, 67% said they wanted more intervention by the federal government with regard to the pandemic. Only 21% want more leeway for the cantons.  The poll was carried out from October 23 to 28, just before the Swiss government announced on October 29 tougher measures to curb the second wave of the pandemic. But, says Sotomo, the survey shows that most of the measures announced this week are supported by the public.    People surveyed also said they wanted a reduction in the current ten-day quarantine period through rapid coronavirus testing.  After initial scepticism in Switzerland about wearing masks, there is now widespread support for extension of the mask wearing obligation. The survey found 64% of people are more or less in favour of compulsory mask wearing in the office, and 59% said mask wearing should be compulsory wherever a minimum social distance of 1.5 meters cannot be kept, including outside.   Two-thirds of those surveyed support closing restaurants at 11pm, as the government has now done, or even from 10pm. Two-thirds of respondents also support restricting private and public events to a maximum of ten people. The Swiss government this week imposed this limit only for private events, suggesting that the population would support stricter measures.  The survey also found support for restricting musical and sports activities. Some 68% support a ban on choir, brass band and orchestral performances and rehearsals, and 63% support a ban on all sports activities where the minimum distance cannot be kept and masks cannot be worn.  However, opinion is divided over whether there should be a short lockdown, as has been imposed in neighbouring France and Germany. Opinion is split roughly half and half, with 49% in favour and 47% against. Older respondents would support it, but the majority of 35 to 44-year-olds would not.   The poll was carried out among 34,825 people in Switzerland across all language regions. 
2020-10-30;Covid 19: cases remain high, measures need time;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--cases-remain-high--measures-need-time/46131494;Switzerland again recorded over 9,000 Covid cases on Friday, as officials warned that the latest anti-virus measures would need time to work. Coronavirus infections rose by 9,207 and hospitalisations by 279, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Friday. The death toll rose by 52, bringing the total to over 2,000 (2,037) for the first time. At a press conference on Friday, the FOPH’s Virginie Masserey said that the second wave was “proceeding apace”.  It was not the same as the first wave in spring as many more people were being tested. But the number of hospitalisations and deaths were developing along the same lines. It is currently difficult to get all the results within the normal time parameters, meaning that there is some underreporting on the daily figures, she added. More older people are being affected by the virus, Masserey said. Children are still less concerned. The good news is that rapid Covid tests, which deliver results within 15 minutes, will be available from Monday. The tests, which need to be carried out by a medical professional, are recommended for people who have been symptomatic for less than four days and who are not in the risk groups. People are being encouraged, through a new FOPH campaign being launched on Monday, to take an online coronavirus checkExternal link to see if they need a test. Martin Ackermann, head of the Swiss Covid-19 scientific taskforce, said the Covid situation in hospitals was developing as predicted: the numbers of hospitalisations and intensive care patients were doubling each week. “Until now, the measures have not really helped so much,” he said, referring to the first set of measures outlined by the government on October 18, which included mask wearing in indoor public places. The latest national measures, announced on Wednesday, which impose early closing time for bars and restaurants as well as extending mask wearing further, would need around two weeks to take effect, he warned. Ackermann underlined that hospitals would also be overwhelmed in the meantime. Canton Zurich already warned on Friday that its hospitals would “soon be very strained”. Masserey also said it was too early to see the effects of the first national measures, as it was only 12 days since they were introduced. How we behave now will affect the figures in late November and December, explained Ackermann. Bern cantonal doctor Linda Nartey also warned against going door to door for trick or treating at Halloween. The government on Friday issued a video messageExternal link in German, French and Italian calling on the population to work together against the virus. Under the Swiss federal system, cantons are still allowed to introduce tighter Covid measures than the national ones. Several cantons did just that on Friday. Jura (which has imposed a cantonal state of emergency) and Neuchâtel have stopped meetings of more than five people. Several cantons extended compulsory mask wearing to pupils in secondary I (age 12-15), going further than the national regulation of pupils aged 15-16 plus (secondary II). Meanwhile, old people’s homes in canton Basel Country are to conduct their own corona tests - a first in Switzerland.
2020-10-30;Study: closing primary schools harms educational equality ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/study--closing-primary-schools-harms-educational-equality-/46131068; Schools closures during the Covid-19 lockdown slowed down younger pupils’ progress and increased the differences between them, a Swiss study has found. Older pupils were less affected.  Further closures of primary schools would therefore not be justifiable if you want to maintain educational equality, the research concluded.    The team around Martin TomasikExternal link at the University of Zurich used a computer-based feedback system - in which teachers gave pupils tasks - to assess how youngsters in the German-speaking part of Switzerland were doing before and during school closures in March and April.   This allowed them to follow the progress of 28,000 primary and secondary school pupils in German and maths.   They found that while home schooling did not affect the learning progress of secondary students (aged 12 plus), primary children’s progress dropped by half, according to results published in the Swiss mediaExternal link on Thursday and Friday.  In addition, some pupils learned faster than others during that time, whereas before the closure they had been learning at a similar pace.   The study did not go into the reasons for this, as no information about the social-economic status of the children involved was released, for data protection reasons.  However, as the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper pointed out, previous studies have shown that children whose parents did not have the time and resources to support them during lockdown were the ones that generally fell behind.  Researchers did not find any significant differences in progress for secondary pupils during lockdown. Tomasik gave three reasons for this. “Older pupils are less dependent on their parents, can better organize and motivate themselves and on average are much more familiar with digital devices,” he told the NZZ.  The authors concluded that further primary school closures would “not be justifiable” in terms of educational equality. But if the Covid situation became worse and it was necessary, they recommended that children from more socially deprived backgrounds continue to be taught in class in small groups.  On Wednesday, the government announced that schools nationwide would stay open – under conditions – under its new anti-coronavirus measures taken in reaction to steeply rising Covid cases. Only universities would be closing.  Cantons, teachers and some experts are against school closures, although some scientists are in favour of the move.   Schools gradually reopened after the spring lockdown in May and June and pupils have been attending class – under hygiene and distancing conditions – in autumn. It is now obligatory for older pupils in secondary 11 level (15-16 plus) to wear masks. Some cantons go further and have also made mask wearing compulsory for secondary 1 level (12-15), but not for  primary school.  
2020-10-30;Four scientific reasons to be cheerful;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/four-scientific-reasons-to-be-cheerful/46130118;I don’t think I’m the only one feeling beset on all sides by negative news right now. The extent to which Switzerland is out in front in Europe’s second coronavirus wave makes me question the more optimistic tone of my last newsletter. But new restrictions were announced in Switzerland and elsewhere this week and there is still time to flatten the curve again. In the meantime, I have chosen four uplifting science stories to share with you. The first is an excellent idea which has the potential to reduce food waste. It’s a horrifying fact that one third of the food produced every year is wasted or lost. I’ve written before about how the food system is broken. The more initiatives there are on the table, the better. Tara Giroud interviewed post-doctoral researcher Niloufar Sharif for this story on scientists fighting food waste at the nano level. The Iranian scientist is working on a three-year project at the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to develop intelligent packaging technologies that can identify spoiled food products. “In her nanotechnology lab at the EPFL, Sharif is building sensors from miniscule carbon nanotubes, cylindrical molecules consisting of rolled-up sheets of single-layer carbon atoms measuring one billionth of a metre, which she hopes will be useful for detecting signs of food degradation.” One billionth of a metre! Moving to a vastly different scale, the latest swissinfo.ch report on the CHEOPS space telescope is a highly engaging video produced by Michele Andina. The Characterizing ExOPlanet Satellite telescope is a joint mission of the European Space Agency and Switzerland, led by the University of Bern. Unlike other missions dedicated to searching for new planets, CHEOPS points at bright stars already known to host planets. It’s all explained in the video by instrument scientist Andrea Fortier, with a little help from Michele’s animation. The telescope uses “ultra-high precision photometry” to observe planets while orbiting their stars. With this method, researchers can determine the radius of each planet. Combined with the planets’ masses, which have already been estimated, researchers can figure out what the composition of each planet is. The CHEOPS telescope started its journey into space on December 18, 2019. The team has already published an in-depth analysis of the exoplanet WASP-189b, a planet one-and-a-half times the size of Jupiter, and there are many more discoveries to come. In a previous newsletter back in July, I mentioned the first electronic airplane that was approved for use in Switzerland, the Pipistrel Velis Electro. Our reporter Simon Bradley took a ride to find out what the flights of the future will feel like. His verdict: the whirr of the electric engine sounds like a noisy dishwasher. This is only the beginning. In the article, we learn that hybrid electric planes capable of carrying 100 people will be flying commercially by 2029, according to British aero-engines maker Rolls-Royce. Siemens predicts that electric propulsion will be the “standard solution” for all aircraft segments by 2050. Wow. And the last good news story, the world’s first high-altitude floating solar power plant is now operating in the Swiss Alps. This technology could become a major part of the photovoltaic industry worldwide. Join Luigi Jorio on his visit to the plant at Lac des Toules which consists of 1,400 panels, laid on 36 floating structures made of aluminium and polyethylene plastic anchored to the bottom of the lake. I hope the great work of these scientists provides an antidote to the bleak public health situation. Winter is coming but so is a vaccine. Hang in there! 
2020-10-30;How long can Switzerland walk the corona tightrope?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-long-can-switzerland-walk-the-corona-tightrope-/46128488;Our analysis of what the biggest global companies in Switzerland are up to. This week: state power in times of corona, Lonza emissions investigation, and child labour in the cocoa industry. The coronavirus crisis has reminded us that government can wield a big stick even in the most competitive market economies. After new daily coronavirus cases topped 8,000 this week, the Swiss people were bracing for a return to a nationwide shutdown. But on Wednesday the government opted to keep the economy rolling foregoing the kind of drastic measures taken in neighbouring countries like France and Germany. This has left some questioning if business is really pulling the strings. Power dynamics between the state and industry have shifted in many countries during the crisis in ways many people have never seen before. In an interview in the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper over the weekend, German historian Ute Frevert explained that “the state reins in capitalismExternal link, directs it along certain lines, allows it to succeed or not. In recent years it seemed to be the other way around”. She added that the drastic measures to contain the virus were not the result of some moral duty but rather about survival and keeping society afloat (although billionaires didn’t suffer too much either thanks to government bailouts). But it is rarely an either-or choice between the economy and health. Few companies can keep operating when half their employees are sick with Covid-19 or in quarantine. When the Swiss vote on November 29, they face similar questions. Where, when and how should the Swiss government rein in business activities that could put people and the environment in other countries at risk? Or should we leave it to the companies and individuals to decide? The latest poll shows the Responsible Business Initiative has solid support, but whether it can maintain it remains to be seen. It’s uncertain how the coronavirus crisis will affect the vote if at all but what is clear is the crisis has proven the state can take the reins when it wants to. Lonza allegedly tried to hide massive nitrous oxide emissions from authorities and shareholders. According to an investigation by Tages-Anzeiger, the Swiss chemical company discovered nitrous oxide emissions in 2017 that were far above normal levels but didn’t immediately report it. The laughing gas contributes more to global warmingExternal link than many other greenhouse gases but fits in a gray zone in national environmental laws. Although there is a clear solution to neutralising the gas, Lonza has resisted paying for it, writes the paper. Novartis adds manufacturing muscle behind potential Covid-19 treatment. This week the Swiss pharma giant sealed a deal with Zurich-based biotech firm Molecular Partners to develop, manufacture and commercialise an early-stage anti-Covid-19 treatment drug. This comes a couple months after the Swiss government signed an agreement with Molecular Partners for first access to a potential treatment it develops against Covid-19. It’s unclear how much the government handed over and the terms of the deal. Swiss cocoa industry received a sobering reminder of the scale of child labour in West Africa. A long-awaited US Department of Labour report released last week revealed that child labour increased by 14% in the last decade, and more than 90% of the children were doing hazardous tasksExternal link. Industry groups all had prepared statements admitting that they had no idea how complex the situation was when they vowed to eradicate child labour 20 years ago. Got a tip?

2020-10-29;Scientists warn of new coronavirus variant spreading across Europe;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/scientists-warn-of-new-coronavirus-variant-spreading-across-europe/46127554;A coronavirus variant that originated in Spanish farm workers has spread rapidly through much of Europe since the summer, and now accounts for the majority of new Covid-19 cases in several countries — and more than 80 per cent in the UK. An international team of scientists that has been tracking the virus through its genetic mutations has described the extraordinary spread of the variant, called 20A.EU1, in a research paper to be published on Thursday. Their work suggests that people returning from holiday in Spain played a key role in transmitting the virus across Europe, raising questions about whether the second wave that is sweeping the continent could have been reduced by improved screening at airports and other transport hubs. Because each variant has its own genetic signature, it can be traced back to the place it originated. “From the spread of 20A.EU1, it seems clear that the [virus prevention] measures in place were often not sufficient to stop onward transmission of introduced variants this summer,” said Emma Hodcroft, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Basel and lead author of the study which is yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The scientific teams in Switzerland and Spain are now rushing to examine the behaviour of the variant to establish whether it may be more deadly or more infectious than other strains. Dr Hodcroft stressed that there was “no evidence that the variant’s [rapid] spread is due to a mutation that increases transmission or impacts clinical outcome”. But she emphasised that 20A.EU1 was unlike any version of Sars-Cov-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — she had previously come across. “I’ve not seen any variant with this sort of dynamic for as long as I’ve been looking at genomic sequences of coronavirus in Europe,” she said. In particular, the teams are working with virology laboratories to establish whether 20A.EU1 carries a particular mutation, in the “spike protein” that the virus uses to enter human cells, that might alter its behaviour. All viruses develop mutations — changes in the individual letters of their genetic code — which can group together into new variants and strains. Another mutation in Sars-Cov-2, called D614G, has been identified which is believed to make the virus more infectious. Joseph Fauver, a genetic epidemiologist at Yale University who was not involved in the research published on Thursday, said: “We need more studies like this to find mutations that have risen to high frequency in the population, and then reverse-engineer them to see whether they make the virus more transmissible.” The new variant, which has six distinctive genetic mutations, emerged among agricultural workers in north-east Spain in June and moved quickly through the local population, according to the study. Tanja Stadler, professor of computational evolution at ETH Zurich who is part of the project, said that analysis of virus samples taken from across Europe in recent weeks showed they were derived from this same variant. “We can see the virus has been introduced multiple times in several countries and many of these introductions have gone on to spread through the population,” Prof Stadler said. Iñaki Comas, head of the SeqCovid-Spain consortium that is studying the virus and a co-author of the study, added: “One variant, aided by an initial super-spreading event, can quickly become prevalent.” The researchers concluded that the “risky behaviour” of holidaymakers in Spain — such as ignoring social distancing guidelines — who “continue to engage in such behaviour at home” helped the spread of the new variant. The research showed that the new variant accounted for more eight out of 10 cases in the UK, 80 per cent of cases in Spain, 60 per cent in Ireland and up to 40 per cent in Switzerland and France. Stringent lockdowns in the early part of the year helped bring the initial Covid-19 surge under control, with new cases substantially reduced over the summer. But the virus has spread rapidly back through Europe in recent weeks in a resurgence that has forced national leaders to introduce painful new restrictions on social activities.

2020-10-28;Switzerland imposes early closing time for bars and restaurants;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-imposes-early-closing-time-for-bars-and-restaurants/46125392;The government is also extending a mask-wearing obligation as part of new wide-ranging measures to fight Covid-19 by significantly reducing person-to-person contacts. Nightclubs will need to close their doors, while restaurants and bars must remain shut between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. With the exception of families and members of the same household, customers will be seated at tables of four people maximum. “We all want Switzerland to be able to manage and overcome this crisis as a united country,” Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga said at a press conference to announce the new restrictions. “No one wants to see another lockdown.” Masks, which since October 19 have been mandatory in all indoor public spaces, must also now be worn in outdoor areas of shops, theatres, cinemas, restaurants and bars, and at open-air markets. Masks are also compulsory in high-traffic pedestrian zones where physical distancing is not possible, in schools from the secondary II level, and in workplaces. Public events of more than 50 people are now banned, including cultural and religious gatherings and sports matches. Exceptions include organised political gatherings, including events to gather signatures for a referendum. A ban on spontaneous public gatherings of more than 15 people, in effect since October 19, remains unchanged. Amateur cultural and sporting events of 15 people or less are allowed, provided social distancing can be guaranteed and masks are worn. Private events among family and friends are now limited to 10 people. The measures announced on Wednesday all come into effect on October 29 and will last until further notice. Measures already imposed by the cantons continue to be applicable, health minister Alain Berset pointed out. Cantons can also impose stricter measures as necessary. Under the Swiss federal political system, the 26 cantonal authorities have wide-ranging autonomy, notably on health matters, and since summer have been implementing measures to combat the pandemic based on the local situation. Rapid antigen tests will be deployed on November 2, Berset also announced, with the objective of significantly increasing the country’s testing capacity. He said the tests, which are less sensitive than the standard Covid-19 tests currently in use, would allow Switzerland to undertake 50,000 more tests per day. The rapid tests are currently undergoing an evaluation at the National Reference Centre for Emerging Viral Infections in Geneva and will be used on those who present symptoms but do not belong to a vulnerable group. Starting Thursday, the government will classify just four countries – Belgium, Czech Republic, Andorra and Armenia – as high-risk. Travellers arriving from these countries will need to spend ten days in quarantine. Previously Switzerland had placed over 60 countries on its risk list, once they had reached over 60 new Covid cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a 14-day period. Berset had indicated last week it made no sense for the country to adhere to such a rule when Switzerland’s own infection rate had far exceeded that bar. The government will also abolish the current rule that limits travel for business purposes or for medical reasons to five days. In line with a measure approved by parliament earlier this autumn, the Federal Council announced that on-call workers with a permanent contract can now apply for benefits if their hours are reduced, retroactive to September 1. But economic affairs minister Guy Parmelin said no additional support measures were anticipated – the law on Covid-19, passed by parliament last month, sufficiently covers financial assistance for various sectors, businesses and their staff, he told reporters. The government on Wednesday said it anticipated a budget deficit of CHF20 billion ($22 billion) for 2020, with some CHF18 billion earmarked to fight the health crisis. The budget for the year had originally forecast a surplus of CHF300 million. The measures announced on Wednesday is the second set of restrictions taken at the federal level to fight the so-called “second wave” of the coronavirus, which Berset previously told reporters had come “earlier and stronger than expected.” During the first wave last spring, the government imposed a nationwide three-month lockdown, bringing public life to a standstill and resulting in a significant decrease in cases by the summer. Overnight Switzerland registered over 8,600 new cases and 24 deaths linked to Covid-19.
2020-10-28;Universities return to distance learning, schools stay open;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/universities-return-to-distance-learning--schools-stay-open/46122598;Swiss universities are to go back to distance learning from Monday, while schools nationwide stay open – under conditions – according to new anti-coronavirus measures announced by the government on Wednesday.  Masks will have to be worn from Thursday in Secondary II level schools, the level that follows obligatory education. This is the second time universities have halted in-person university classes after the lockdown in spring. However, widespread cases of Covid-19 at universities – as seen in the United Kingdom or the United States, for example – have so far been relatively rare. The highest profile was when undergraduate students at the École hôtelière de Lausanne(EHL), one of the most prestigious hospitality management schools in the world, were placed in quarantine on September 23 after several coronavirus outbreaks. Several universities, including the University of Lucerne, the University of Geneva and the federal technology institute ETH Zurich had already made announcements concerning distance in the days preceding Wednesday. The University of Bern was even earlier: October 19. On Wednesday the University of Bern made the wearing of masks compulsory and lectures and tutorials would be taught online. On March 13 the Swiss government took the unprecedented step of ordering the nationwide closure of all schools, overriding the cantons’ authority (cantons are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland). Whereas primary schools mostly went back to class teaching after re-opening on May 11, older pupils in post-compulsory schooling (vocational and baccalaureate schools) were only allowed back in small numbers from June 8. Many continued with distance learning. During this time there were concerns that disadvantaged pupils were falling behind in their learning. Since then cantons have been charge of schools’ protection concepts. But calls have been mounting from experts for more targeted and nationally applicable measures for schools. “We must introduce obligatory mask wearing in schools straightaway, also in primary schools,” Geneva epidemiologist Olivia Keiser told the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper on TuesdayExternal link. There should also be better airing of classrooms to reduce risk of infection via aerosols, she said. But she is not sure whether the mask measures will be enough or whether “perhaps partial school closures are necessary”. However, the government, cantons, teachers and other experts are against school closures. Questions have also been raised about how much younger children pass on the virus. The current thinking by the Swiss authorities is that they are low risk. In reaction to the government's announcement, the heads of the two main teaching unions LCR and SER said on Wednesday that while they welcomed obligatory masks in class for Secondary II level, they had hoped for more rules for primary school. Yves Flückiger, president of the umbrella group swissuniversities, said that institutions expected gaps in learning, student isolation and problems in research as a result. He told the NZZ newspaperExternal link that universities had to do everything in their power to maintain educational quality. This could mean for example that we keep libraries open. One semester of remote learning could be enriching, but a second one is already problematic and a third would influence the quality of upcoming degrees, he said. Communication could only partially take place over distance learning. This type of teaching could not replace face-to-face exchange, Flückiger warned.
2020-10-22;Schools, universities react to Covid case surge;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/schools--universities-react-to-covid-case-surge/46110674;Mask-wearing will be obligatory for adults and older pupils in schools starting Wednesday in several more cantons, in reaction to the second wave of coronavirus cases. The University of Bern has already moved to expand distance-learning. On Thursday, announcements were also made by canton Basel City and the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI). Canton Schwyz, which has been particularly hard hit by the latest rise in cases – an apparent super-spreader event at a yodeling concert has put its main hospital under severe pressure – has extended mask-wearing in schools. Beginning Wednesday, all secondary-level pupils (aged 12 and up) will have to wear face coverings in class.  Previously this rule applied only to those aged 15-16 and up (secondary 2) and teachers. An increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among pupils at the secondary 1 level, as well as more absences due to quarantine, prompted the change, officials said. Wearing masks should stop entire classes from going into quarantine, the cantonal educational departmentExternal link added. Appenzell Outer Rhodes, in central Switzerland, has also introduced mask-wearing for all secondary pupils. The aimExternal link of school authorities is to avoid school closures. In the canton of St GallenExternal link, there is a now recommendation for adults in primary schools to wear masks in all areas except classrooms, according to measures decided by the canton on Tuesday. Canton Basel Country has also upped masked wearing for both primary and secondary levels of school, and canton Basel City announced on Thursday that secondary schools pupils will have to wear masks in  in classrooms from Monday. Lucerne has also stepped up measures. In Switzerland, cantons are in charge of educational matters, also during the pandemic. Nationwide measures – such as the school closures last spring – are exceptional. Canton Zurich introduced masks for all adults in primary schools starting this past Monday. Various cantons already oblige older pupils to wear masks, but children under 12 are still generally exempt (the thinking being in Switzerland that they are not the main drivers of the pandemic). On Wednesday Alain Berset, the Swiss government minister in charge of health, reiterated External linkthat as cantons were in charge of education, the government did not envisage intervening at present on schools. Higher education is also affected. The University of BernExternal link has decided to limit in-person, on-site courses to those with a highly interactive component, like seminars, tutorials and lab classes, starting this week. Big lectures are going back online, as are events in rooms with more than 120 seats. However, at present it is the only university to take this kind of action. Institutions are prepared for all scenarios, said the rector of the University of Fribourg, Astrid Epiney - who is also the vice president of the umbrella organisation swissuniversities. Many people are working from home - as recommended by the government - but some teaching needed to be done on site where possible, she told Swiss public television SRFExternal link. Nobody was being forced to come onto campus. she added. Universities had protection measures in force, Epiney said. On Thursday the USI university in canton Ticino added mask wearing in class to its raft of measures.
2020-10-21;Government plans tightening anti-Covid restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-plans-tightening-anti-covid-restrictions/46111530;Interior Minister Alain Berset says further measures would be introduced as early as next week, if steps taken at the weekend to slow the spread of the coronavirus proved insufficient. He did not specify but hinted at limitations for restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as private and public gatherings. The measures could be announced as early as in a week’s time. Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, Berset whose portfolio includes health issues,  described the rapid increase of infections and hospitalisations as alarming. “Two, three weeks ago, Switzerland had one of the best situations in Europe,” he said, referring to the number of cases. “Today we have one of the worst.” He said it was important to prevent both a shortage of hospital beds available and another shutdown of public life with damaging consequences for the economy. On Wednesday, the number of new daily Covid-19 infections reached nearly 5,600 and is expected to rise further. “The next few weeks will be decisive,” Berset said. He urged private individuals to take the current situation very seriously, avoid holding private parties and respect hygiene rules. He also appealed to employers to allow their staff to return to telework. Berset said the government was considering several options, including a short lockdown or curfews, if the situation does not improve. “We can only exclude two options: Shutting down public life over the next 18 months, and doing nothing at all,” he said. On Thursday, Berset is due to meet health directors of the country’s 26 cantons, which are largely autonomous under the Swiss political system. He repeated that the Swiss government had no intention of taking over the lead as it did between March and June, under the terms of the country’s epidemics act. Many cantons had proved that they are capable of taking the necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus – banning sports events in front of crowds, and closing or limiting opening hours of restaurants, nightclubs and bars, according to Berset. He pointed out that the situation in different regions of the country differ considerably at the moment. Last Sunday, the government made mask-wearing mandatory in all indoor public spaces. It also imposed rules for private gatherings of more than 15 people.
2020-10-20;Swiss government: ‘The second wave has arrived’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-government---the-second-wave-has-arrived-/46109164;The second wave of Covid-19 has arrived in Switzerland faster and stronger than expected, according to the federal health authorities. Just over 3,000 new positive coronavirus cases and eight deaths were reported on Tuesday. The seven-day average of new cases has increased by 123% on the previous week to 2,636. On a per capita basis, Switzerland has twice as many new infections as Italy. “The second wave has arrived, faster and clearer and stronger than we would have thought two or three weeks ago,” said Thomas Steffen, a Basel physician and member of the board of cantonal physicians at a press conference on Tuesday. According to Stefan Kuster from the Federal Office of Public Health, authorities have hospitalisations under control but the number of people in intensive care stations was changing quickly. At midday on Tuesday, of the 700 occupied intensive care beds about 100 were occupied by Covid-19 patients. Five days ago there were 61 people with Covid-19 in intensive care. “The doubling in hospitalisations [since last week] is noticeable,” Kuster said at a press conference on Tuesday. He cautioned against comparing infection numbers in this wave with those in the first wave. “While younger people were mainly affected in the summer, we have seen a change in the past few weeks.” Positive cases are spread across age groups, he said. Studies show that the more virus spreads in the population, the more concern there is for older populations in nursing homes. Amid the spike in cases, on Sunday the government announced several measures to bring the cases under control. These include a mask-wearing requirement in all indoor public spaces, a recommendation for home office and limits on the number of people in private gatherings. The health authorities expect cases to double every week until the new measures take effect. The surge in cases is complicating contact tracing, especially as cases are all over the country. All cantons are well above the risk limit of 60 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, which has been used to classify regions at high-risk. “We still don’t understand where the infection took place for the majority of cases,” Kuster said. Rapid tests are currently being validated and the authorities will decide in the next few days when, for whom and how these can be used. The government has also massively increased its stock of supplies. The government has not developed a master plan of measures it could put in place if the situation were to worsen. It also said there wasn’t enough evidence that a short lockdown as a “circuit breaker” could help bring the virus under control. However, Kuster said every measure was being considered that could help contain the virus.
2020-10-20;Top epidemiologist urges greater uptake of contact-tracing app;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/top-epidemiologist-urges-greater-uptake-of-contact-tracing-app/46108064;Switzerland needs a major communications push to bolster contact-tracing efforts, says epidemiologist Marcel Salathé, who led the development of the SwissCovid app. In an interview on Swiss public radio, SRFExternal link, Salathé said that after a surge in positive coronavirus cases it was time to intensify communication efforts around the app’s utility. Some 1.7 million people currently use the app, launched on June 25, which is below the Federal Office of Public Health’s aim of three million active users. Salathé heads the Digital Epidemiology Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). In July the statistics office reported that the number of active users had begun dropping at a steady rate as positive cases waned over summer. Salathé noted that some of the previous concerns about privacy had been put to rest. “People have now understood that it is an extremely secure app that can help support contact tracing,” he said. According to SRF, about 130 positive cases had been found using the app, which Salathé said was a “very good start” and not necessarily lower than expected. If only 20% of Swiss use the app, and only 20% of contacts have the app, only 4% of all contacts are actually covered. He said this showed that the app produced reliable results but to be more effective it needed more users. Other areas that needed improvement include the time between someone testing positive and cantonal authorities providing the person with a code to enter into the system. “We are in contact with the cantons on how this can be improved,” Salathé said. After a spike in cases last week, some cantonal contact-tracing authorities reported being so overwhelmed that some people were left to alert contacts of a positive test result on their own.  The SwissCovid app was the first in Europe to use the application programming interfaces of Google and Apple. In other Covid-related news, the head of the Swiss Armed Forces, Thomas Süssli, has tested positive for Covid-19 but is so far not experiencing any symptoms. Süssli “is feeling well and is conducting business as much as possible from home”, according to a government statement on Monday. His deputy, Aldo Schellenberg, will provide support if needed. This week Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr, - the cabinet manager who takes part in  government meetings, went into quarantine after coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin has been in quarantine since last week due to contact with someone who tested positive.
2020-10-19;Industry signals relief at Swiss anti-coronavirus measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/industry-signals-relief-at-swiss-anti-coronavirus-measures/46105546;Swiss business groups have welcomed government measures that seek to control a second wave of Covid-19 without resorting to the enforced closure of companies. Numbers of infected people have risen sharply in recent weeks, prompting the federal authorities to intervene once again on Sunday. But the new measures have fallen well short of the lockdown that was imposed on households and business earlier in the year. The government has tightened the rules on mask wearing, contained private gatherings without masks to no more than 15 people, recommended teleworking and ordered diners to only eat whilst seated in restaurants and bars. Canton Bern has restricted public events to no more than 1,000 people, with other cantons expected to follow suit. The Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse) said it “supports the coordinated approach of the federal government and the cantons. If implemented consistently, the increased protective measures will be an efficient step towards fighting the pandemic. And they are an important contribution towards preventing a second lockdown.” Casimir Platzer, head of the hospitality association Gastrosuisse, said the risk of infections at eating establishments was small thanks to the seating requirements. “Many companies are already struggling to survive. Another lockdown or other economically unsustainable restrictions would put the existence of the hospitality industry in doubt,” he said. The restaurant and bar industry has already lost 33,000 jobs as a result of the pandemic, he added. Several other countries, most notably in Europe, have enforced more stringent measures to nip a second wave in the bud. This includes city-wide and regional lockdowns in some areas. Rudolf Hauri, president of the Association of Cantonal Doctors, said the government’s measures have hopefully arrived just in the nick of time. Several hospitals have already warned that they are nearing over-capacity due to the increased number of coronavirus patients, but Hauri said the situation across the country as a whole was under control. Asked by Swiss public broadcaster SRF whether they will have a positive impact, he replied that it “depends above all on how well the measures are implemented and how well the population supports them.” This is a view echoed by the Swiss trade union Unia. Spokesman Nico Lutz told SRF that mask wearing and social distancing measures ordered for the workplace would only carry weight if companies followed such instructions.  He warned that many construction sites have been too lax at protecting workers. Financial support from the government has so far prevented a wholesale wave of companies collapsing. Figures from the research agency bisnode show that bankruptcies in the first nine months of the year are actually a fifth lower than the same period of last year. But the figures show that some sectors - notably hospitality, construction and furniture - have suffered more than other industries. Businesses across the board have so far been helped out by bail-out loans and subsidised wages for workers put on shortened hours. Companies have also been given more time to pay off debts while the usual bankruptcy rules have been relaxed. 
2020-10-19;Sergio Ermotti: ‘My best decision was not to follow consensus’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sergio-ermotti---my-best-decision-was-not-to-follow-consensus-/46105330;When Sergio Ermotti became chief executive of UBS in November 2011, the 158-year-old Swiss bank was at one of the lowest points in its history. Markets were plunging amid the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and just months earlier UBS had revealed that a rogue trader had hidden SFr1.8bn ($2bn) of losses, a scandal that took down Mr Ermotti’s predecessor, Oswald Grübel. Mr Ermotti, who had joined UBS in 2010 from Italy’s UniCredit, received a battlefield promotion to right the ship alongside new chairman Axel Weber, an ex-economics professor and former Bundesbank president. Nine years later, the 60-year-old is stepping down in the middle of a new kind of crisis, one he describes as “profoundly different” because clients and staff are “scared for their lives” this time, not just for their homes or investments. “Do I enjoy crises? I’m not as masochistic as that . . . but of course I know this is the time where I’m meant to be most visible,” Mr Ermotti says. “It’s very difficult to enjoy such a situation, but of course, it makes the job a fantastic one when you never really know what’s next.” Mr Ermotti will hand over to Ralph Hamers in November and move to chair insurer Swiss Re. There is little doubt that despite lingering misconduct issues — such as the bank’s potential €4.5bn fine for helping French clients evade tax — he leaves UBS in a better state than he found it. Since 2011, UBS has made $37bn in pre-tax profit and returned $20bn to shareholders, all while absorbing $15bn of litigation and regulatory costs. The chief executive won plaudits for a shrewd repositioning after the financial crisis, slashing back — but retaining — the investment bank’s trading arm and solidifying its position as the world’s largest wealth manager, increasing assets under management by more than $1tn to $2.6tn. Many, including rival Credit Suisse, copied his strategy. Mr Ermotti says the best decision he made was to ignore the clamour from journalists, analysts and shareholders calling on him to sell the US wealth business and shut down the investment bank in the wake of the rogue-trading scandal. “My best decision was not to follow consensus . . . I’m sure I wouldn’t be the CEO today if I had done it,” he says. “With hindsight it’s always easy [to second-guess], but as a leader, your first instinct is usually the right one . . . So if I have to learn anything, it’s to rely on those instincts even more.” Wealth management in the Americas contributed pre-tax profit of $1.3bn last year and the investment bank — despite a series of embarrassing losses in 2019 — has benefited from a surge in trading revenue during coronavirus, cushioning the blow from 100s of millions of dollars in potential losses from consumer-loan defaults. “My advice to Ralph is to take his time and not to listen to the consensus,” Mr Ermotti says. He should “not to be tempted to impress people just for the sake of it in the first few months”. In the early days of the pandemic, Mr Ermotti worked a few days a week from his home office in Lugano — the small lake town where he was born, 200km south of Zurich on the Italian border. During coronavirus “it’s been a different intensity than usual. The topics discussed are all top priorities,” he says. At the nadir of the pandemic in Europe in late March, UBS had more than 90 per cent of its staff working from home. “I know it’s an issue when you have a family, maybe a husband and wife both working with kids around, how complicated it can be logistically,” he says. Mr Ermotti has had to learn to communicate in a different way, making staff “comfortable that they are operating in a safe place, that we care about them . . . the soft part of the equation, a dimension that was never as present before, to be honest”. In 1975, Mr Ermotti left school at 15 to become a football player, but quickly realised he “wasn’t good enough” and decided to be a sports teacher instead. But first, he was required to do an apprenticeship and was assigned to the securities department of a family-run private bank. Initially dismissing business as “boring”, the experience “changed my life” and “by the time I was 16 I knew I wanted to be a trader”, he says. “I heard people talking about political matters, economics, the financial market was hectic, everything that was going on in the world was affecting what those people were doing . . . every day was different.” His first big move was to Citibank in Zurich, then in 1987 Merrill Lynch asked him to open a Swiss capital markets operation when he was only 27. Running rapacious trading floors and overseeing wealth managers with the ear of some of the world’s richest people, Mr Ermotti has had to deal with many mercurial characters, notably ex-wealth management boss Jürg Zeltner — who died this year — and Andrea Orcel, whom he recruited to turn around UBS’s investment bank.  When managing “big personalities . . . I always try to be complementary, let people manage their business, interfere only when necessary”, he says. I have “a philosophy like when I was captain of the football team in my younger years . . . You need to create teamwork, while understanding that it’s not possible to be friends all the time. “As long as everybody drives in the same direction, I had no problems . . . [but] when people are thinking more about their own personal profiles and their own interests than . . . the good of the clients and the organisation, it’s not working,” he adds. “I don’t want to have blind loyalty, but I expect trueness and transparency, and when I discover that people are not that way, I act accordingly.”  Does that mean getting rid of them? “Yes.” Mr Ermotti has never been shy about voicing blunt opinions. Consistently one of Europe’s best-paid bankers — earning an average of SFr11.5m a year over his tenure — in 2017 he said regulators’ criticisms of bonuses were “made by people who are maybe frustrated that they do not make that kind of level of money”. Last year he started a Twitter account, @UBS_CEO. And when the bank was going through a bad patch of earnings, became mired in a €4.5bn French tax scandal, was criticised for slashing the pay of women on maternity leave and speculation swirled about his future, he occasionally used it to lambast news organisations, including the Financial Times, about their coverage of the lender. Mr Ermotti maintains that he takes criticism well as a leader, when it is justified. “Generally speaking, I’m open to criticism, but what I don’t like is people who are superficial and not well-informed,” he says. “If there is one thing I really hate, it’s hypocrisy . . . For me, it is one of the worst malaises in our society.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-10-18;Swiss can overcome Covid crisis without another lockdown, says leading epidemiologist;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-can-overcome-covid-crisis-without-another-lockdown--says-leading-epidemiologist/46104320;Mistakes, such as allowing public events to resume too quickly, likely contributed to the surge in coronavirus cases this autumn, said Christian Althaus, adding that the country can still bring the situation under control if it “acted now”. Althaus, a member of the national Covid-19 scientific taskforce, told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper “cantons had probably been too careless” with public events, after restrictions on gatherings of more than 300 people were eased last June. “With a somewhat lower upper limit, we would certainly be in a better situation today,” he said. “The pathogen is now not only present in all corners of Switzerland, but it has also spread to all age groups.” He also believed the authorities had not kept the population “more aware of the pandemic” during the summer. “The emphasis was probably too much on personal responsibility.” Infections have soared throughout the country in recent weeks – the daily number rose to over 1,000 in early October and reached a record 3,105 on Friday. As the Federal Council met on Sunday to discuss possible stricter measures on a national scale, Althaus struck a note of optimism, saying generalised mask-wearing should allow the population, and particularly those in risk groups, to continue to participate in public life. “We should be able to keep the shops open safely throughout the winter with masks,” he said. “I also believe that we must do everything we can to prevent school closures”. Limiting private gatherings made sense, as “that way, you can do most activities, simply perhaps on a smaller scale.” A recommendation to return to telework is “overdue”, the Bern-based epidemiologist said, adding that restaurants and bars may need to be closed for short periods “if the situation derails completely”. Ultimately, Switzerland was in a good position to overcome the crisis thanks to its “economic resources, good medical care and strong science.” “There is also a great willingness among the population to implement sensible measures so that we can get through this winter together.”
2020-10-17;Emergency care workers urge Swiss government to act as Covid cases soar;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/emergency-care-workers-urge-swiss-government-to-act-as-covid-cases-surge/46103186;Three groups representing emergency and rescue services called on the federal government to take immediate “coordinated measures to contain the second wave” a day after Switzerland registered a record number of new cases of the coronavirus. The Swiss Society of Emergency and Rescue Medicine, Switzerland Emergency Care and the Swiss Association of Paramedics – which together represent the majority of all emergency doctors, nurses and paramedics in the country – said on Saturday their members had been providing non-stop care since the beginning of the crisis, including operating emergency units, rescue services and test centres. Without support from the authorities, the groups warned, emergency workers may not be able to maintain essential services. The groups pointed to the physical and psychological toll the crisis was taking on their members, which they said could worsen if the government did not take uniform measures against the coronavirus across the country. A delay in introducing such measures was absolutely incomprehensible , the three organisations said in a joint letter. On Friday Switzerland registered a record 3,105 new cases of the coronavirus. Since the summer, Swiss cantons have managed the pandemic with a patchwork of measures. Meanwhile, in a taped speech at a virtual convention of the Social Democratic Party on Saturday, interior minister responsible for health Alain Berset acknowledged the country was in the midst of its “greatest crisis since the Second World War”. “We must all take our responsibilities,” he said, highlighting the need to respect hygiene rules. “Are we tired of the coronavirus? Yes, without a doubt […] But the virus doesn’t care.” Country-wide restrictions may already be in the works. According to communication seen by news agency Keystone-SDA and published on Friday evening by the CH-Media group, the Federal Council is actively considering new national measures to fight the surge in Covid-19 cases. These include making mask-wearing mandatory in all indoor public spaces, limiting gatherings in public places such as parks to 15 people, and recommending telework. Keystone-SDA reports these measures have been submitted to the cantons for review. The Federal Council will meet on Sunday morning for an extraordinary session, sources close to the government told the news agency.
2020-10-16;‘Turning point’: Concerns grow over hospitals’ Covid capacities;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-turning-point---concerns-grow-over-hospitals--covid-capacities/46101344;Swiss hospitals could quickly reach their limits as the country experiences a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, warns Geneva virologist Isabella Eckerle. Cantons are now also calling for the government to step in with country-wide rules. The number of new coronavirus cases in Switzerland rose to more than 3,000 on Friday. Eckerle's laboratory at Geneva University Hospitals is working almost around the clock, the virologist said in an interview External linkwith the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Friday. The hospital still had enough test material, but the demand worldwide was high. The hospital might soon not be able to test everyone who needs a test, she said. Meanwhile the hospital boss, Bertrand Levrat, told news agency AP that Europe was at a “turning point” in the fight against the coronavirus. “The virus doesn’t spread alone – we're the ones who spread it,” he said. “If we don’t get a handle on this, we run the risk of getting into a situation that’s harder to control,” he said. “We are really at a turning point. Things can go both ways. Health services need to look for ways to keep up contact tracing (and) to succeed in getting a grasp on the chains of transmission.” Meanwhile, cantons – who are currently in charge of managing the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a patchwork of measures across the country – have called on the Swiss government to impose nationwide rules to fight the spread of the virus. This includes the wearing of masks and working at home. Cantonal health chiefs issued their statement after meeting Health Minister Alain Berset. Experts were also on hand during an official press conference on Friday afternoon to give an update on the situation, which the Federal Office of Public Health's Virginie Masserey called serious . She said the government would react to the cantons in due course. Rudolf Hauri, president of the cantonal doctors' association, added that everyone had been surprised by the speed of the rise in cases. He admitted there were some problems with contact tracing, saying it often needs time, which you don't have when the virus is spreading quickly . But he said he was sure that hospitals were better prepared for coronavirus cases than they had been in spring. The comments come as Schwyz Hospital sounded the alarm over the number of rising cases in the central Swiss canton – a cluster is thought to have come from a yodelling concert. By Friday there were 1,352 confirmed cases of the virus in the canton compared with around 500 in mid-September. The rise has been particularly steep since Tuesday and the canton tops the list in terms of infections per inhabitants. “The proportion of positive tests is extremely high. We have moved from 30% to 50%,” said hospital director Franziska Föllmi on Thursday. The hospital’s medical chief Reto Nüesch earlier released a YouTube videoExternal link imploring the local population to wear masks and not to attend festive events. He said the explosion of cases in Schwyz was “one of the worst in the whole of Europe”. A yodelling concert held at the end of September attended by 600 people is thought to have contributed to the rise. There was social distancing at the event – large events are now permitted in Switzerland – but mask wearing was not obligatory. A record 3,105 new cases were reported across the country on Friday.
2020-10-16;Covid-hit media must find new ways to grow ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-hit-media-must-find-new-ways-to-grow--/46090380;Some Swiss media outlets lost as much as 95% of their advertising revenues during the Covid-19 pandemic and they are not alone. Local media in many rich countries are suffering similar fates. But quality news media are more important than ever and must find new ways to grow, argues Geneva-based journalist Brij Khindaria. Unlike their colleagues in most other countries, Swiss editors have public service in their DNA. In the early weeks after the partial lockdown on 16 March, hardly any media outlets criticized the government’s handling of the pandemic, and it is still rare nearly six months later. In contrast, media in the United States, France, Italy, Britain, Spain and many other countries savaged their leaders and are still virulent critics. Partly because of this feistiness, consumer interest for news on all platforms has increased considerably. But advertising revenues continue to fall across the board.  Covid-19 has brutally demonstrated how a microscopic virus can destabilize entire business sectors that are major advertisers on print and online media, including international travel, leisure, entertainment, restaurants, processed food, fashion and retail.  Subscriber revenues are also falling. The subscriber research group Enders Analysis estimates that nearly half of lost subscriptions may never come back. Interest in information increased greatly as the pandemic hit, but it has not translated into higher earnings for most local media. In Switzerland, even larger media have been badly hit. The European Journalism Observatory notes that the pandemic produced a dramatic increase in consumers of all media in Switzerland. Television news grabbed 80% of market share at the height of the crisis and hits on the Le Temps website tripled. But earnings remain sluggish. Even stalwarts like Neue Zürcher Zeitung and Tages-Anzeiger did not unlock online Covid-19 content to make it free, because of lower advertising revenues.  The pandemic has also triggered a decline in coverage of news at the United Nations office in Geneva (UNOG), which is unfortunate because it is the global centre for the majority of major UN-sponsored meetings affecting the lives of ordinary people. They include important subjects, such as development, labour, disarmament, trade, economy, health, food, weather, social and humanitarian affairs, and human rights.   Since the onset of Covid-19, almost all international in-person meetings on UN system premises in Geneva have been cancelled or drastically reduced and media events are mostly virtual. A result has been to accelerate the downgrading of Geneva-based news by the editors of major news outlets around the world, with the exception of pandemic related information from the World Health Organization. The world’s biggest news agencies have reduced staffing at UNOG and some are closing their offices. Only Chinese media have increased their presence in recent years.   Swiss media companies on the brink of financial crisis are in exalted company. For instance, eMarketer, a market analyst, estimates that Google and Facebook are taking nearly 80% of digital ad revenues from local media in the US. The News Desert Project of the UNC Hussman School of Journalism reminds us that the US has lost nearly one-quarter of local media since 2004, including more than 1,000 outlets in the last 10 years. It defines a news desert as a local community without a daily newspaper. This affects one in three Americans now. The project finds that many local newspapers are “ghosts” of their former selves in the US. They are increasingly owned and operated by hedge funds and private equity funds that use aggressive cost cutting, which reduces the quality of news reporting.   France offers an alternative model where media outlets continue to receive more subsidies than elsewhere in Europe. The London Institute for Media Strategies estimates direct subsidies in 2019 to French print and online news media at nearly €114 million with another €103 million in postal and tax breaks.  But subsidies can disincentivize media managers from acquiring the skills necessary to navigate the tougher challenges confronting journalism now. Oxford university’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism suggests that the current crisis may increase inequalities between those rich enough to pay for niche online media, and others stuck with sites that are less scrupulous about impartiality in their efforts to monetize web traffic. Falling advertising revenues have plagued Swiss and other rich country media for several decades. But Covid-19 is a new type of threat because of the breathtaking scope of its adverse impacts.   Confronted with so many upheavals, decades-old practices of media entities and journalism are being questioned for relevance to a new epoch where people must learn to live with pandemic-related economic and social shocks. The core need is to strengthen the financial and professional reliability of media outlets to withstand onslaughts from social media, fake news, disinformation and lower advertising revenues in a world economy shaken regularly by pandemics.   The challenge for all media entities is to find opportunities for growth in a coronavirus environment that is disrupting the world of work and eroding the domestic and global economic, social and business fabrics that have generated jobs and rising living standards for half a century.  Media outlets will fail to grow without winning a credible role in the lives of people battered by negative trends in pandemics and climate change. Building trust with consumers takes time, hard work and sustained investments.   The role of media is more important than ever in a world of data-driven artificial intelligence, unprecedent migratory flows and the geopolitical rivalries of the US, Europe, Russia and China. Without viable solutions for media outlets, including financing, we may be overwhelmed by viral chains of misinformation and fake news on social media.   The distortions would feed into conflicts among voters and disintegrate democracies by marring elections with voter fraud and outside interference. This is already visible in the US presidential elections due on 3 November, which are heavily tainted by allegations of potential mail fraud and interference through social media by Russia, China and Iran.   
2020-10-16;Swiss organisers plan for fanless World Cup ski season;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-organisers-plan-for-fanless-world-cup-ski-season/46101084;No fans, no race ceremonies and no promotional villages are planned at World Cup ski events in Switzerland this season. The Swiss ski federation said on Friday that it was working with local organisers to have competitions without the public as coronavirus cases peak in the Alpine nation ahead of the winter sports season. Crowds of about 30,000 typically attend Switzerland’s signature races on back-to-back Saturdays in January: the men’s giant slalom in Adelboden and the men’s downhill in Wengen. The 2020-21 season also includes women’s race weekends in St Moritz and Crans-Montana, the World Cup finals week for men and women in Lenzerheide, and a ski jumping event in Engelberg. Swiss-Ski said no grandstands would be built at those venues, nor fan villages at the races and in resort centres. Some invited guests could attend in restricted zones separated from athletes, coaches and officials. The federation said its officials and race organisers would stay in contact with public authorities and could modify plans as the pandemic develops in Switzerland. The World Cup ski season starts this weekend without fans for men’s and women’s giant slalom races in Sölden, Austria. No races will be held in the United States and Canada to limit travel and quarantine restrictions for teams. The only scheduled races outside Europe are women’s speed events in China in February to test a 2022 Beijing Olympic course in Yanqing. 
2020-10-16;Swiss sign next vaccine agreement with AstraZeneca;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-sign-next-vaccine-agreement-with-astrazeneca/46101078;Switzerland has signed an agreement with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to pre-order up to 5.3 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine that is currently under development. “Given that it is still not clear which vaccines will ultimately prevail, the government is taking a diversified approach,” a statement said on FridayExternal link. Switzerland has already inked a deal with United States biotech firm Moderna to secure early access to 4.5 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine. It has also confirmed its participation in the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative aimed at ensuring equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines when they are approved. “The Swiss public will therefore gain access to a further Covid-19 vaccine – provided it successfully passes the clinical trial phase and is approved by Swissmedic,” the statement said. The contract with AstraZeneca – and the Swedish government – is based on an agreement between the European Commission and AstraZeneca for the delivery of up to 400 million doses for Europe. These doses can be ordered by individual states according to their population numbers and procured once the vaccine has been approved. Sweden will order doses for countries like Switzerland which is not a member of the EU but is a member of EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and resell them at no profit. If approved, the vaccine will be delivered directly to Switzerland by AstraZeneca, which submitted an application for approval of its medicine to Swiss drug authority Swissmedic at the start of October. This was the first time that a drugmaker had presented a coronavirus vaccine for approval in Switzerland.
2020-10-15;Government opens investigation into IKEA wood sourcing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-opens-investigation-into-ikea-wood-sourcing/46099688;The Swiss authorities have launched proceedings against IKEA for alleged false declarations of where timber is sourced. The furniture company rejects the accusations. The case was triggered by a complaint filed on August 31 by the Bruno Manser Fund with the Federal Department of Economy, Education and Research (DEFR) and the Federal Consumer Affairs Bureau. A DEFR spokesperson confirmed with news agency Keystone-SDA that proceedings were launched. After inspecting five IKEA branches concerned, the DEFR opened administrative criminal proceedings in two cases of possible repeated false timber declarations. According to DEFR, this is the first time the company has been subject to criminal proceedings for a false declaration. The Swiss timber law requires that companies provide information on the origin of each wood product. IKEA Switzerland rejects the charges. Aurel Hosennen, who is a member of the IKEA Switzerland management team told Swiss public television, SRF, that IKEA has all of the origin information available. “We know from every supplier which wood they are working with and where it comes from. We have been showing this on our website for years. There is no reason for Ikea to hide or not reveal anything. Hosennen added that labels, which are hand-printed by IKEA, are sometimes missing in furniture stores because it is a manual process. In each branch, 80 to 100 labels have to be replaced each day because they are lost. The Bruno Manser Fund, which is dedicated to protecting forests, argues that in some cases the company doesn’t provide sufficient information on the timber origins. This makes it difficult to determine if the wood was in fact sourced sustainably. Riding through the pandemic Ikea Switzerland saw sales rise 0.7 percent to CHF1.15 billion this year, despite the coronavirus lockdown. In an interview in the Tages-AnzeigerExternal link on Thursday, IKEA Switzerland CEO Jessica Andere said that the company was able to make-up for about 15% of loss in revenue by reacting quickly with more drive-in pick-up points. On November 2, the company will introduce a taxi service that will drive customers home with their furniture purchases. Andere also said that in response to the pandemic and the financial strain facing customers, the company reduced prices for some 250 products. During the pandemic, they have sold more items in lower price categories.  
2020-10-15;Switzerland sends coronavirus aid to Ukraine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-sends-coronavirus-aid-to-ukraine/46099636;Another shipment of Swiss aid material has found its way to the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, including equipment needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, 19 trucks overcame quarantine restrictions and wildfires to make the delivery. On board were medical supplies, including 46,000 Covid-19 testing units, protective suits, masks and contactless thermometers. Around a fifth of people infected in the region are medical workers. The trucks also brought 300 tons of aluminum sulphate and 15 electrolyte devices to purify water at the Vodadonbassa waterworks, which supplies around four million people. The Donetsk region is still an area of conflict and has been made even more perilous for the local population by the outbreak of coronavirus. The Swiss humanitarian aid convoy, the 12th such shipment of supplies to the region, cost CHF3.5 million ($3.8 million). It was accompanied by four members of Swiss Corps for Humanitarian Aid.
2020-10-15;Swiss public urged to keep pandemic in check to avoid lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-public-urged-to-keep-pandemic-in-check-to-avoid-lockdown/46098772;The rapid rise in coronavirus cases has put Switzerland in a precarious situation, said Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga. But there are, for the time being, no concrete plans to tighten measures to control the pandemic, including restrictions like those in place earlier this year. On Thursday, the number of new daily Covid-19 infections exceeded 2,000 for the second day in a row. The number of new infections reported on Wednesday was 2,823 – double the number recorded the previous day. Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, called on the population to redouble efforts to observe hygiene and social distancing measures. “The number of infections is increasing sharply within a short period of time,” she said at a press conference on Thursday following discussions between the government and cantonal authorities. “It is once again shortly before 12 O’Clock. We call on the whole population to do their bit so we can keep the virus in check.” Sommaruga’s remarks come as canton Zurich announced that teachers will be obliged to wear masks while teaching. In canton Nidwalden, some 400 people have been quarantined after an infected person visited two nightclubs. It has also been reported that 73 children accompanying adults at a scout camp were infected earlier this month. On Thursday, Germany added eight Swiss cantons to the two already on its risk area listExternal link. People arriving in Germany from these cantons may be obliged to quarantine for 14 days depending on the German state they arrive at. The federal government, cantons and business groups are working together to find ways to stem the second Covid-19 wave while balancing personal freedoms and potential damage to the economy. The representatives of the federal government and cantons were at pains to point out harmony in their joint efforts to contain the pandemic. Lukas Engelberger, president of the Conference of Cantonal Health Directors, said the impact of the rising coronavirus cases on hospitals will not be known for a couple weeks. He warned that the compulsory wearing of face masks may have to be needed. Health Minister Alain Berset will meet with cantonal health representatives on Friday to discuss possible further measures. “We still have the situation under control and our goal is to avoid a lockdown and overloading hospitals. We're worried about this because it's only the beginning of October.” He added that cantons are still free to allow mass events of more than 1,000 people if they deem the local situation and the event safety measures to be reasonable. The government and cantons are also talking about stepping up testing across the country. Asked about the possibility of rapid, high volume new testing techniques, Berset said that these innovations are still being appraised before they can be released. Urban Camenzind, Vice President of the Conference of Cantonal Economic Directors, said that some cantons had experienced a 10% drop in economic output after the partial lockdown in March closed shops, restaurants, construction sites and other businesses. He said that future closures should be avoided. 
2020-10-14;Swiss daily Covid cases double to 2,823;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-daily-covid-cases-double-to-2-823/46096320;The number of new daily coronavirus infections in Switzerland rose to 2,823 on Wednesday, double the figure reported on Tuesday, according to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). This is the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. Eight deaths and 57 hospital admissions were also registered. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic there have been a total of 68,704 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, the FOPH saidExternal link on Wednesday. A total of 5,167 people have been treated in hospital for Covid-19. The total number of deaths associated with Covid-19 disease has risen to 1,816. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein a total of 1,536,725 tests for Sars-CoV-2, the pathogen of the respiratory disease Covid-19, have been carried out. Over the past two weeks, 9.9% of all tests have been positive. The FOPH said 5,250 people were in isolation and 11,093 people were in quarantine on Wednesday due to contact tracing. In addition, 14,664 returnees from risk countries were in quarantine. On Wednesday Economics Minister Guy Parmelin became the first cabinet minister to go into quarantine, the government confirmed. He has no symptoms and tested negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday. On Thursday the government will meet cantonal health directors to discuss a tightening of measures, for example the wearing of masks, testing and limiting the number of public or private gatherings. Under the Swiss political system, the 26 cantonal governments have wide-ranging autonomy notably on health issues.
2020-10-12;Technology firm Ruag International to cut more jobs;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/techonology-firm-ruag-international-to-cut-more-jobs/46092418;The Swiss aerospace and armament company, Ruag, says it will shed up to 150 jobs by the end of next year due to the coronavirus crisis. A 30% drop in sales of aircraft structures over the past seven months and the restructuring of the company are the main reason for the job cuts notably in IT, finance and human resources, according to a company statementExternal link published on Monday. “Due to the high cost pressure caused by the corona crisis, the planned savings must be expanded and accelerated,” the statement said. The company says it will take several years before the aviation industry will return to pre-crisis levels. In February the company announced 90 job cuts in central Switzerland. Ruag, formerly a state-run company, has numerous production sites in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Austria, the United States and Hungary. In 2018, the Swiss government decided to unbundle the company into two separate entities by 2020: Units that continue to work for the Swiss Armed Forces and Ruag international with its internationally oriented business units. Ruag is the latest Swiss-based company to announce major job cuts as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, notably General Electric, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

2020-10-12;Swiss government determined to avoid repeat of Covid lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-government-determined-to-avoid-repeat-of-covid-lockdown/46092168;Interior Minister Alain Berset has defended Switzerland’s policy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic despite a steady rise in confirmed infections. Berset said on Monday that the overall aim of the strategy was to prevent a repeat of the three-month nationwide lockdown, which led to a near standstill of public life. He repeated that the current strategy, which places the responsibility for new restrictions with the 26 cantonal authorities rather than the national government, was a proven method. Under Switzerland’s federalist system cantons have wide-ranging autonomy, notably on tax, health and education issues. Berset, whose portfolio includes health, also dismissed a change in the testing policy focusing on elderly people and other risk groups. He called on the population to adhere to the hygiene rules and welcomed the protection measures put in place by sports clubs, which notably allow national football and ice hockey matches to be played in stadiums with a limited number of spectators. Berset’s comments come as confirmed Covid-19 cases have continued to increase over the past weeks and as critics call for the government to take the lead again. There are currently no nationwide regulations on the wearing of face masks – except in public transport – or on closing bars and nightclubs. Meanwhile, several members on the government’s Covid-19 taskforce have expressed concern over the spike in Covid-19 infections. Epidemiologist Marcel Tanner called for increased efforts by the population to respect hygiene rules, including social distancing, in the face of a growing number of patients with coronavirus admitted to hospital. The head of the expert group, Martin Ackermann, recommended the authorities re-impose limits on the number of people allowed at public gatherings. He told Swiss public radio, SRF, at the weekend that it was crucial to stabilise and reduce the number of new Covid-19 infections.
2020-10-12;Four Vatican Swiss Guards test positive for Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/four-vatican-swiss-guards-test-positive-for-covid-19/46091876;Four members of the Vatican Swiss Guards, the colourfully dressed corps that has protected popes for 500 years, have tested positive for Covid-19, the Vatican said on Monday. They are believed to be the first in the corps to test positive. The results came in over the weekend and added to three other residents or citizens of the tiny Vatican city-state who have tested positive in recent weeks, according to a statement. Nearly all of the 113-strong Swiss Guards are single men who live in a barracks just inside the Vatican gates. The commanders and married members live in separate apartments. All members are Swiss and Catholic. The Vatican said all of those who had tested positive had mild symptoms. They have been isolated and tracing of those with whom they had been in direct contact was underway. The Vatican last week instituted prevention measures stipulating that everyone had to wear masks, even outdoors, and practise social distancing. But some have noted that Pope Francis does not wear a mask at his general audiences and sometimes comes in relatively close contact with visitors, who are wearing masks. Some of his closest aides have not been wearing masks at the audiences. On Friday surrounding Italy topped 5,000 new Covid-19 cases in a single day for the first time since March. The country is set to ban private parties and limit the numbers of guests at weddings and funerals among new restrictions aimed at curbing a surge in coronavirus infections.
2020-10-12;Swiss government expects 2020 GDP to shrink less than feared;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-government-expects-2020-gdp-to-shrink-less-than-feared/46090870;Swiss economic output will shrink by 3.8% this year, a less bad coronavirus-triggered slump than previously expected, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said on Monday. The latest SECO forecast was an improvement from its June outlook, when it said it expected Swiss gross domestic product (GDP) would fall by 6.2% this year, the worst downturn since 1975. The easing of lockdown restrictions from the end of April had helped a recovery, SECO said, although unemployment still remained higher than a year earlier. Consumer and investment demand exceeded expectations during the second quarter, while short-time working – a measure introduced to prevent layoffs – was needed less than previously thought. The improving situation was expected to have continued into the third quarter, the government said, with some sectors like accommodation and restaurants being boosted by stay-at-home Swiss customers. Still, parts of the economy that depended on global demand such as manufacturing industry and international tourism were still facing a tough time. For 2021 SECO said it expected the Swiss economy to grow by 3.8% when adjusted for income for sporting events, a slower recovery than the 4.9% level that was previously anticipated. As a result, the Swiss economy would return to its pre-crisis levels only towards the end of 2021, the government said, assuming there was no reintroduction of widespread lockdown measures triggered by a resurgence in Covid-19.
2020-10-11;Hotel sector sees gloomy outlook ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hotel-sector-sees-gloomy-outlook-/46090274;Swiss hotels are predicting a worsening outlook, as newspapers warn thousands of jobs could be lost in the sector. According to the latest survey by sector association HotellerieSuisseExternal link  at the beginning of this month, more than a third of hotels (37%) say they will have to lay off staff in the coming months. The rate is particularly high in cities (59%). Thousands of jobs could be lost in the sector in the next six months, warn Le Matin Dimanche and NZZ am Sonntag newspapers. Some 80,000 people work in the sector, according to Le Matin Dimanche. Hotellerie Suisse said on Sunday that for a large majority of hotels (66%), this summer season was significantly worse than last year throughout Switzerland. Although more Swiss people spent vacations in rural and alpine regions, this did not make up for the absence of foreign tourists. In the coming months, “the hotels are clearly expecting a reduced number of guests and significant losses in turnover”, says HotellerieSuisse. Seventy percent of hotels in all regions expect a worse winter season than last year. And urban hotels are particularly pessimistic, with 90% expecting a clear decline in the situation. The sector association is calling for rapid coronavirus testing instead of quarantine, harmonization of European travel regulations and targeted support measures from the government. “The current rules jeopardize the profitability of the establishments, thus increasing the danger that they will have to close down unnecessarily,” it says. “Entire teams of employees are often quarantined. In addition, travellers are discouraged from coming to Switzerland.” 
2020-10-11;Contact tracing not working properly, writes paper;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/contact-tracing-not-working-properly--writes-paper/46090060;Contact tracing is no longer working in some parts of Switzerland, owing to the recent sharp rise in coronavirus cases, reports the SonntagsZeitung newspaper. In Zurich, for example, it says the contact tracing team is so overwhelmed that the canton now leaves it to potentially infected people to alert their contacts themselves. This is confirmed to the paper by cantonal health department spokeswoman Lina Lanz. Sonntagszeitung says it also knows of several cases in which contact tracing failed and potentially infected persons were not alerted. In many cantons, only 10-20% of newly infected persons were quarantined at the time of a positive coronavirus test, it writes. Greater efficiency is needed to break chains of infection,” Bern-based epidemiologist Nicola Low tells the paper. “The rate of those already in quarantine when the infection is confirmed must be increased to 80 percent. Marcel Tanner, epidemiologist and member of the government’s Covid-19 taskforce admits that contact tracing is reaching its limits in some places”. But he says we must not give up contact tracing now under any circumstances” and the cantons must make even greater efforts, otherwise a second wave will hit us . The number of new daily cases across Switzerland this week rose to over 1,000 for the first time since the height of the pandemic in spring. A spokesman for the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has told the Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA that the government is working, in collaboration with the cantons, on a winter strategy to fight coronavirus. The strategy will be announced in the coming weeks, he said. He thus confirmed a report in the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday saying the government is considering various scenarios for regional lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus. The article is sourced to reports of telephone conversations between the FOPH and cantonal doctors.
2020-10-11;Swiss scientists fight food waste at the nano level;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-scientists-fight-food-waste-at-the-nano-level/46084408;Every year, around 1.3 billion tonnes of food goes to waste worldwide. In Switzerland researchers are trying to help tackle the food waste challenge using nanotechnology. It can happen to anyone - a yogurt at the back of your refrigerator has passed its best-before date and you end up throwing it in the garbage or compost. But was it actually ok to eat? The best-before quality recommendation stamped on food can be confusing for consumers. Perhaps the food in that particular package was perfectly safe and tasty. And by ending up in the bin unnecessarily, it simply added to the mountains of food waste. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), roughly one-third of all food produced every year is wasted or lostExternal link from farms to shops to caterers to households. Switzerland is a major culprit: 190 kilos of food is wasted per person annually. Niloufar SharifExternal link believes she might have an answer to this problem. The Iranian post-doctoral researcher is working on a three-year project at the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to develop intelligent packaging technologies that can precisely identify which products are spoiled. “When we have sensors, then we can monitor the real-time product,” the food scientist told swissinfo.ch. In her nanotechnology lab at the EPFL, Sharif is building sensors from miniscule carbon nanotubes, cylindrical molecules consisting of rolled-up sheets of single-layer carbon atoms measuring one billionth of a metre, which she hopes will be useful for detecting signs of food degradation. These ultra-tiny sensors, integrated into food packaging, react when food goes off. A system then interprets the data and translates it into a sign people can read on the outside of the food package. Different foods decompose in different ways, at various rates and under different conditions, such as light and moisture levels. Sharif believes her sensors can react to certain gases during bacterial or fungal activity on the food. One way it can do this is by monitoring pH levels, which tell if something is acidic, neutral or alkaline, and can indicate food decomposition. “If we have a product in which there is no microorganism activity, we may have, for example, a pH of 7 [which is in the middle or neutral],” Sharif said. “When we have activity of microorganisms, this pH will change. If this sensor detects changes of the pH, it alerts us to some kind of activity of microorganisms.” If the pH moves into unsafe territory, a sensor on the label alerts food managers or shoppers that the food is no longer safe to eat. Sharif’s project was selected as part of the Future Food InitiativeExternal link, a Swiss science-industry programme that aims to expand research and education in the area of food and nutrition. Although her work has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, she is now busy setting up the lab for the first of the project’s three phases: testing the sensors with various gases, integrating the sensors into packaging materials, and testing on actual food. Another recent food waste project in Switzerland used nanotechnology to make smart packaging possible. It was completed in 2018 as part of Switzerland’s National Research Programme NRP 69, “Healthy Nutrition and Sustainable Food Production”. In the University of Basel’s chemistry department, Professor Cornelia Gabriela Palivan and Ozana Fischer developed small glass surfaces to which they attached minuscule capsules, measuring just 100 nanometres in diameter, or 1,000th the width of a human hair. The tiny capsules can be filled with different substances for various uses. The simplest, Palivan said, is as a reactor that can indicate when an environment has changed, such as when the quality of food deteriorates. With the sensors, “you will see a presence of specific molecules that are associated with food degradation,” she told swissinfo.ch. To test their research, the scientists filled capsules with the fluorescent dye pyranine. As the pH level of their environment changed, the intensity of pyranine’s fluorescence varied. In other scenarios, the capsule could be designed to detect a specific harmful substance. Once detected, a gate would open allowing the harmful substance into the capsule where it would interact with a substance already inside the capsule rendering it harmless. Consumers would see a square label about 0.5 cm in size that would change in colour to indicate freshness. This could look like a traffic light, where a green label means the food inside is fresh and a red label would indicate that the product is no longer safe to eat. The Basel team published their findings in the Swiss chemistry journal “Helvetica Chimica Acta” in 2018.  For Palivan, if people do start to call for changes, results like her group’s work are ready to show what can be done. “In research we are developing new technology, therefore we have a solution,” she said. “If society needs them, we can go ahead, but we need more support.” Karin Spori, managing director of foodwaste.ch, a Bern-based non-profit organisation, said it was interesting to see the ideas researchers are bringing to the table. She imagined that industry, such as chefs or food donation centres, could make use of a system like the one Palivan and her team developed. But the trained biologist felt less confident about its use at the consumer level. She said people may not want something called nanotechnology affiliated with their food. Spori said changes in households are more likely by educating consumers to trust their sense of smell and taste for freshness and to manage how they buy and use food. “Smart packaging doesn’t make me smart if I don’t organise my food properly,” Spori said. She added that in industrialised countries like Switzerland, there’s little pressure to change how consumers approach their own food waste. “Seven percent of the household budgets are for food in Switzerland, a small amount,” Spori said. The Swiss consumer’s mentality is often that, “when a yogurt doesn’t look so fresh, you can just buy a new one”, she added.
2020-10-10;What’s being done about mask and glove pollution?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/what-s-being-done-about-mask-and-glove-pollution-/46085310;"They protect us while we wear them, but what happens to all those masks and gloves after we discard them? As more places make mask-wearing compulsory, we are facing the problem of how to manage a new source of pollution. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a new form of waste that is not easy to handle. Take masks, which are made up of three elements – the “fabric” part, the metal strip for pinching on the nose, and the elastic bands. Here lies the first complication, as the different materials cannot be recycled together. What is more, the protective part is not actually made of fabric, but of a plastic called polypropylene. As for the gloves, at best they are made of natural latex; at worst they are also plastic and give rise to the same problems as masks as they decompose. Environmental groups have been sounding the alarm for several months now. In February OceansAsiaExternal link published the first shocking pictures of beaches strewn with pandemic-related debris near Hong Kong. In Europe, teams from Opération mer propre (Operation Clean Sea), founded by diver Laurent Lombard, were the first to find signs of this pollution on the French Mediterranean coast. The association continues to publicize the growing ecological impact of the coronavirus crisis. Last month, volunteers who turned out to clear rubbish from Lake Geneva for World Cleanup Day collected piles of protective masks. Non-governmental organizations such as Earth.orgExternal link and GreenpeaceExternal link are also trying to draw the authorities’ attention to the problems posed by PPE. Even before it decomposes, discarded PPE is hazardous to wildlife. Dolphins and sea turtles easily mistake gloves for jellyfish, with fatal consequences if they swallow them. Animals can also become entangled in the elastics of the masks. Then, as they break down, these objects release plastic microparticles. In the sea, these are swallowed by fish, and finally turn up on our dinner plates. On land, they seep into the groundwater and pass into our drinking water. In a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, a member of parliament from France’s Alpes-Maritimes coastal region (next to the Côte d’Azur), Eric Pauget, urged the president to step up efforts to combat PPE pollution: “With a lifespan of 450 years, this gear is a real ecological time bomb, given its lasting environmental consequences for our planet”. In view of the huge number of masks and gloves being distributed, different players – mainly private – have set about looking for solutions. Recycling masks is complicated from a logistical point of view; the coronavirus can survive for up to three days on plastics, no appropriate public collection sites are in place, very large amounts are needed, and the masks’ composition based on three different elements further exacerbates the problem. Recycling is therefore costly and few entrepreneurs are willing to take the plunge. Nonetheless, the French company Plaxtil seems to have found a way to recover this waste. The masks are placed in quarantine, then they are cut up manually before being shredded, disinfected by ultraviolet light and mixed with a binder material. This produces a paste that can be used to make small objects like visors, mask clips and door handles. Most initiatives, however, are focusing instead on producing biodegradable masks. For instance, a Belgian start-up, CUVCOV, makes reusable masks “of micro-fibre created from recycled materials”, as its website tells us. Each one comes with a biodegradable pouch for storage. In Switzerland, meanwhile, the fledgling company HMCAREExternal link is taking the lead. A spin-off from the EssentialTech Centre at federal technology institute EPFL in Lausanne, it has designed a protective mask that is 99% made of materials derived from biomass. Called HelloMask, it is transparent and recyclable, and should be available in 2021. Some people argue that reusable masks are not environmentally neutral, as they must be machine washed at 60°C in order to disinfect them. According to a study by University College LondonExternal link, what makes the difference is how the masks are cleaned. After analysing the overall environmental impact of manufacturing, using and disposing of single-use masks, reusable masks and reusable masks with disposable filters, the team concluded that, over one year, reusable, filterless, machine-washable masks had the lowest impact. In Switzerland, the Federal Office of Public Health has posted a list of recommended masks on its websiteExternal link. Regarding cloth masks, it stresses that these should bear the “community mask” label, guaranteeing compliance with a number of set criteria. Since March, the group reMask has been working with the Swiss government’s Covid-19 taskforce. Véronique Michaud, EPFL professor and one of the group’s scientists, says that the environmental aspect was not the initial priority, but that she is confident that the projects currently underway will have an indirect effect on PPE pollution. Specifically, the group is working to extend the durability of surgical and FFP masks. “This addresses two issues at the same time: the environmental impact and the risk of supply shortages,” Michaud told SWI swissinfo.ch. reMask is also in contact with Swiss textile companies in order to support them in producing cloth masks with the requisite qualities. Whereas the homepages of most European environmental ministries feature links to the action they are taking to tackle pandemic-related waste, the Federal Office for the Environment simply refers viewers to a site where different personalities give their points of view on the environmental opportunities and challenges stemming from the coronavirus crisis. The page contains no recommendations on the environment. There has also been no assessment in Switzerland of the pollution caused by PPE. The Federal Office for the Environment told SWI swissinfo.ch that it did not “collect figures on waste, as the issue is the responsibility of the cantons, municipalities and cities”. Other bodies, namely the Union of Swiss Cities and the Swiss Association for Municipal Infrastructure, took the same approach, adding that “the issue does not appear as a problem on [our] radar screens”.

2020-10-09;Switzerland reports record daily number of new coronavirus infections;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-reports-record-daily-number-of-new-coronavirus-infections-/46087624;The number of new coronavirus infections in Switzerland and Liechtenstein rose by 1,487 in a day - a record - the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Friday. This is 300 more new cases than the previous day and is a daily record: new daily cases peaked at 1,456 on March 23. On Friday, the average case count stood at 97 per 100,000 residents over the previous two weeks, FOPH saidExternal link, while the test positivity rate over the same period was 6.5%. New FOPH director Anne Lévy says the fast-rising number of new infections is worrying. “The number of cases and the proportion of positive tests, as well as the proportion of older people, are increasing rapidly and across Switzerland,” she told reporters in Bern. But she added that Switzerland was “well positioned to cope with the next few months”. In view of the increase, the FOPH has launched a new Covid-19 prevention campaign, replacing blue health messages with orange ones on posters and on social media.  The public health body says it is important to bring the infection numbers down but the current health advice and measures – social distancing, hand washing, hygiene masks where necessary, and use of the SwissCovid app – remain the same. But they must be respected, says FOPH. Head of disease control Virginie Masserey said it was the FOPH’s aim to avoid a situation where the population had to be asked to stay home again. New infections have been reported across the country, with the exception of cantons Appenzell Outer-Rhodes and Obwalden, in eastern Switzerland. Over half of all new infections (53%) have occurred in cantons Geneva, Vaud and Zurich. The average case count for canton Geneva stands at 85 per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks and 77 for Vaud. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been 1,794 reported deaths and 5,001 hospitalisations in the Alpine nation. In total, 60,368 cases of infection have been confirmed out of 1.4 million tests carried out in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. On Friday, Switzerland also added regions in neighbouring Germany, Austria and Italy to its at risk list of places from which travellers must enter mandatory ten-day quarantine. It added Berlin and Hamburg in Germany, the Austrian provinces of Burgenland and Salzburg, and the Italian regions of Campania, Sardinia and Veneto to their list. In addition, Canada, Georgia, Iran, Jordan, Russia, Slovakia and Tunisia joined the list as of Monday.
2020-10-09;Geneva is experiencing a spike in Covid-19 hospitalisations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-is-experiencing-a-spike-in-covid-19-hospitalisations/46086976;The worsening Covid-19 situation in canton Geneva is extremely worrying, according to the cantonal doctor Aglaé Tardin. There are currently 50 patients being treated for the virus at Geneva University Hospital (HUG). “There is a major issue concerning private parties, family reunions and drinks with friends, Tardin told reporters in Geneva on Thursday. “Each time we must always ask ourselves if it is possible to organise these things with fewer people and keeping our distance.” Tardin said it was urgent to act immediately, otherwise, “choices will have to be made as to whether or not to we can look after sick people”. Geneva recorded 133 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and 78 on Wednesday. The number of hospitalisations has jumped to 50 patients at the HUG, or two-thirds of its current capacity for coronavirus patients. Six were in intensive care on Thursday. Tardin said she was concerned by the rising number of cases and increase in the number of older patients. She fears that the number of deaths, which stands at 314 since the start of the pandemic, will soon increase in Geneva. The number of new coronavirus cases continues to rise steadily in Switzerland. On Friday, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said 1,487 new cases had been recorded over the previous 24 hours, 300 more than the previous day. This represents a daily record: new daily cases peaked at 1,456 on March 23. The average case count stood at 97 per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks, while the test positivity rate over the same period was 6.5%. New infections have been reported across the country, with the exception of cantons Appenzell Outer-Rhodes and Obwalden, in eastern Switzerland.

2020-10-07;WEF 2021 to be held in the luxury Swiss resort of Bürgenstock ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wef-2021-to-be-held-in-the-luxury-swiss-resort-of-buergenstock-/46082892;The World Economic Forum’s annual gathering of world leaders will take place in May 2021 with the location shifting from Davos to the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne.  WEF organisers announced on Wednesday that the 2021 edition would be held on May 18-21. In line with an earlier announcement to host a smaller gathering, the multi-day networking event will be held in the hilltop Bürgenstock resort in central Switzerland instead of the traditional mountain bastion of Davos in the eastern part of the country in January.   The number of physical attendees is expected to halve from around 3,000 to a maximum of 1,500. The theme of the 2021 event is “The Great Reset”, in reference to rebuilding the world after the coronavirus pandemic.  WEF 2021 will be preceded by high-level “Davos Dialogues”, digitally convened by the World Economic Forum during the week of January 25.   Given the rise in coronavirus infection in Europe, including in Switzerland, the organisers do not guarantee that a physical WEF will take place.  “The meeting will take place as long as all conditions are in place to guarantee the health and safety of participants and the host community,” WEF said in a statement on Wednesday. 
2020-10-07;Swiss researchers create artificial lung to study Covid-19 blood clots;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-researchers-create-artificial-lung-to-study-covid-19-blood-clots/46082676;Scientists at the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) have created an artificial lung to better understand how the new coronavirus causes blood clots in certain patients. A recent studyExternal link revealed that around 10% of hospitalised Covid-19 patients develop blood clots, however, it is unclear why the virus causes this reaction. In the most severe cases, the blood clots can result in a stroke. To investigate this phenomenon and other Covid-19 infections, EPFL scientists have developed a microfluidic chip that models the human lung and replicates part of its structure. The chip holds lung epithelial cells, blood-vessel cells and immune-system cells, and lets scientists directly observe how the virus attacks human cells and triggers the formation of blood clots. When that happens, scientists say two mechanisms may be occurring. One is an excess production of cytokines, which are proteins that play a role in immune-cell signalling, leading to so-called “cytokine storms”. These can damage blood vessels and cause blood clots to form, and are potentially fatal. The other possible reason is damage to the interior lining of blood vessels – or the endothelium – in the lungs. The lungs have a lot of this kind of tissue, and when it’s damaged, blood can coagulate easily and form clots. To help find out, the EPFL team took a lung-on-a-chip device and adapted it to model the individual steps in a SARS-CoV-2 attack on the lungs. The device contains microfluidic channels that feed nutrients to cells on the chip, which are arranged to recreate a section of the lungs. Inside the chip there is a layer of epithelial cells, the cells coating the lungs, and a layer of endothelial cells, the cells lining the blood vessels. These two layers are separated by a membrane. During their tests, when the virus was introduced into their device it first attacked the outside layer of epithelial cells, just like in a natural infection. The team found that within a day the virus had reached the inner layer of endothelial cells and caused considerable damage over subsequent days. “There was enough damage to destroy the endothelium and expose blood in the vessels to air, causing clots to form,” says Vivek Thacker, a postdoctoral researcher. “With our lung-on-a-chip system, we found that the virus may be causing blood clots by attacking the endothelium directly. However, that doesn’t mean that cytokines don’t play a role too and make things worse.” To further their understanding, the team plan to use their lung-on-a-chip with actual blood samples so that they can observe clot formation directly.
2020-10-07;Roche supply problems hit UK Covid testing regime;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/roche-supply-problems-hit-uk-covid-testing-regime/46082190;The Swiss pharmaceutical giant, one of the main suppliers of coronavirus diagnostic tests for Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), said a move to a new distribution warehouse last month was causing a delay in dispatching certain products. The company has expressed regret over the situation and said it was prioritising the dispatch of Covid-19 diagnostic and antibody tests. However, it said it could take up to two weeks to resolve the issue. The warehouse in East Sussex in Southern England is Roche’s only distribution centre in the UK, the BBC reportedExternal link. According to one expert who spoke to the Reuters news agency, Roche is a major supplier of reagents used in routine blood tests, in cancer diagnostics and in Covid-19 tests. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday the problem is expected to have little to no impact on COVID testing, Reuters reported. Earlier, Trade Minister Liz Truss had made similar reassurances. But British media have reported that hospitals were already experiencing supply problems and feared rationing might be necessary. In a letter sent to NHS trusts, Roche advised the healthcare services to “prioritise essential services only.” The delay in supply comes as the UK experiences a rise in new coronavirus infections and other recent glitches in its test-and-trace regime, including a technical problem that delayed the reporting of some 15,000 positive test results.
2020-10-07;Swiss factory rushes to prepare for Moderna Covid-19 vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-factory-rushes-to-prepare-for-moderna-covid-19-vaccine/46081656;"The Lonza plant at Visp, deep in the Swiss Alps, is a hive of activity. Workers are racing to set up production lines to be able to start making a Covid-19 vaccine for US firm Moderna later this year. The 2,000-square-metre space in the new Lonza factory is still a construction site. But Torsten Schmidt, who heads the company’s Visp facility in canton Valais, southwestern Switzerland, is confident. “Everything will be ready to produce the first doses in December,” he told reporters on Tuesday. The Swiss pharma company is building three vaccine production lines in Visp at a cost of $210 million (CHF191 million) to supply 300 million doses annually for the rest of the world. In parallel, new production lines at Lonza’s site in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, aim to start making vaccine ingredients exclusively for the US in November. A project of this size normally takes two years, Schmidt explains, but due to the urgency of the pandemic they have had only eight months to complete it. Three teams have been working round the clock, seven days a week. “The delivery of the equipment was critical,” Schmidt told Reuters. “You typically wait 12 months; you’re talking here about 4-5 months. In the end, the CEO has been talking to the CEOs of suppliers to get the equipment delivered.” Meanwhile, Lonza is still hiring some of the 200 workers needed to operate the production lines at the “Ibex” district in Visp, which will comprise six buildings when it is finished. This race against the clock takes place as scientists and drug companies push ahead in their search for a successful Covid-19 vaccine. There is no approved vaccine yet, but 11 are reportedly in advanced trials, including from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, whose candidate relies on technology never previously approved that enlists human cells to help trigger an immune response. The Lonza press visit coincided on Tuesday with the announcement by Swiss drug authority Swissmedic that it had begun evaluating a rival candidate: the “Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca”. It is the first time that a drugmaker has presented a coronavirus vaccine for approval in Switzerland. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, submitted its application to Swissmedic at the start of October. Lonza has a ten-year contract to supply ingredients to Moderna, including for up to one billion doses annually of Covid-19 vaccine. However, the vaccine has yet to receive formal approval from US or Swiss regulators. The ingredients include a synthetic version of messenger RNA (mRNA), genetic material, which is packed inside tiny fat droplets called nanolipids. This then instructs human cells to make a non-replicating form of the coronavirus’s spike protein and trigger an immune response in the body. The ingredients will be frozen at -70° Celsius and then shipped from Visp to Spain’s Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi SA for “fill and finish”, the final stage of manufacture. Switzerland has signed an agreement with Moderna to secure early access to the Covid-19 vaccine the US biotech company is developing, it said in August. Switzerland will get 4.5 million doses of the vaccine, enough to vaccinate 2.25 million people if, as expected, two doses are needed per patient. In parallel to this agreement, the Swiss government is continuing talks with other companies in what it calls a “diversified approach” to gaining access to a vaccine. It also continues to support multilateral projects for the fair distribution of a future cure, it writes. The government has earmarked CHF300 million for the procurement of a vaccine. In a recent poll carried out in Switzerland, half of the people questioned said they would get vaccinated against Covid-19 if an efficient vaccine were available. Men would be more likely to do so than women."
2020-10-07;How a Swiss computer game is teaching kids to defeat Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/playing-a-game-to-defeat-the-virus/46072686;The Swiss-developed CoronaQuest computer game is helping pupils in Switzerland and abroad protect themselves – and face their fears over the coronavirus. The educational game, launched by canton Vaud in May for pupils aged 4-16, has been played 342,000 times globally (end of September figures). It now exists in 11 languages. I introduced my 5-year-old son to it and we've played the first two levels, said Julien Schekter, head of communication at the canton’s Department of Training, Youth and Culture, who also led the game development team. Schekter said there was a surge of interest in computer games at the peak of the coronavirus crisis. This led to the development of a number of educational games in which heroes wear masks and socially distance. But as far as he knows, “only this Swiss-made game CoronaQuest adds a psychological aspect . This was key for the canton, which rolled out the game as pupils returned to compulsory school on May 11, after an eight-week nationwide lockdown. The additional task was to help children cope with their fears [over the virus], a universal concern, and with their anxiety about returning to school. Some kids suffered from isolation, lost relatives, or they experienced family conflicts. Game characters also experience those things. It helps to start a dialogue in a classroom,” Schekter told swissinfo.ch via phone. An online card game aims to defeat the Covid-19 virus. The virus lays out its cards with physical symptoms like  Cough , Fever or Fatigue but also attacks with cards named Fear , Loneliness or Poverty. Players can beat them with Disinfection , Parent , Nurse , Friend and other cards.In a video made by canton Vaud, students and educators gave their reactions to the game:  Children aged 11-12 are already reaching next levels (there are now four, the latest having been added for the start of the autumn term). In these levels not only do the virus threats become more sophisticated, but new helper cards also appear. These include  Politician based on Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset, “Journalist” and “Statistician”. Some cards were suggested by young players who sent in drawings. Keeping immigrant families in mind, the game has been translated into the canton's ten most spoken languages (French, German, Italian, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Albanian, Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian). But the game has been discovered by users from more than 80 countries. The 11th language is Romanian, after a group of teachers from Romania got in touch and asked if they could translate the game for their pupils. The Vaud team has added it to the game for free. “The game was designed to help children and families in canton Vaud, but we are delighted that it can also help around Switzerland and the world,” Schekter said.
2020-10-06;Swissmedic reviewing AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissmedic-reviewing-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine/46079834;Swiss drug authority Swissmedic has begun evaluating the so-called “Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca”. It is the first time that a drugmaker has presented a coronavirus vaccine for approval in Switzerland. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, submitted its application to Swissmedic at the start of this month. The vaccine’s scientific evaluation will be done via a “rolling submission” process. This allows a pharmaceutical company to launch the application procedure before a product’s development is complete. This “enables Swissmedic to carry out the scientific assessment of non-clinical data from laboratory tests while clinical trials are still in progress,” announced Swissmedic in a statement on Tuesday, noting that trial results must be submitted for scientific review as they become available over the next weeks and months. “However, no decision on authorisation can be taken until all the data needed to assess the safety, quality and efficacy of the vaccine have been submitted. The documentation must demonstrate how safe and effective the vaccine is in protecting humans against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,” wrote the Swiss drug authority. Swissmedic noted that while it is reviewing the vaccine independently, it is also working closely with partner authorities abroad. No medicinal product can go onto the Swiss market without Swissmedic’s approval.  
2020-10-06;Swiss domestic violence cases on the rise ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-domestic-violence-cases-on-the-rise-/46079096;Swiss police registered 19,669 cases of domestic violence last year, up 6.2% on the previous year.  Twenty-nine people died in Switzerland in 2019 as a result of domestic violence, according to the Federal Statistical Office (FSO), meaning that two- thirds of all homicides last year were the result of abuse by a partner. Every four weeks a woman is killed within a partnership, it says.   Half of all recorded domestic violence crimes occurred in an existing relationship, while 28% were perpetrated by ex-partners who committed psychological and/or physical violence. In 72% of cases women were harmed, while in 28% men were the victims.  Forms of violence recorded by the police included assault (32%), threats (22%), insults (19%) and bodily harm (10%).  Experts point out that there are also a high number of cases that go unreported. According to Susan Peter, who heads the federation of Swiss women’s shelters, many women do not go to the police for fear of more violence or loss of reputation.  While statistics for 2020 are not yet available, victim support groups fear domestic violence may have increased, especially during the spring coronavirus lockdown.   
2020-10-05;Why you may already be living in a smart city;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/smart-cities-switzerland-netherlands-trends/46066920;Broken streetlamp? Report it via an app. Disease attacking trees in the city forest? Send a drone to check for damage. Too many delivery trucks jamming up the downtown area? Build a last-mile logistics hub with bikes and e-vehicles. The idea of cities using technology to improve the lives of residents is gaining global momentum, with cities like Barcelona, Copenhagen and Singapore featuring high in smart city rankings. There’s Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland, and more modest towns like Winterthur, too. Being smart is all about sustainability for Winterthur, a town about a half-hour train ride north of Zurich. With support from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Winterthur analyzed its patterns of energy use. Reducing consumption is a key goal of the town of about 115,000 inhabitants. “We developed an app which gives feedback to households so they can track and reduce their consumption,” explains Vicente Carabias, head of Winterthur’s smart city unit and professor at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). In a pilot phase of the Social Power Project, participating households saw their energy use drop by more than 8%. “Now we’re entering the second phase, where we’re in kind of a competition with other cities as well.” Winterthur was also the setting for this year’s Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES2020External link). Smart Cities was the focus at the event, held at the beginning of September. In the Netherlands, the partner country of SGES2020, the Amsterdam Logistic Cityhub wants to streamline and decarbonize the flow of goods into the city centre by 2022. One idea is to replace delivery vans with e-boats to take advantage of the city’s extensive waterways. The Dutch city of ‘s-Hertogenbosch, aka Den Bosch, wants to become a future-proof cycling city thanks to apps tested by children and seniors. Using data means cyclists never have to stop at a red light, says Den Bosch Mayor Jack Mikkers, referring to an app that tells traffic signals when cyclists are approaching. Winterthur also hopes to improve its infrastructure with the help of an app that records the movements of cyclists and pedestrians, yet anonymizes their personal data. Monitoring pedestrian traffic in real-time – and using the data to visualize human density during the coronavirus pandemic – is something Dutch firm Argaleo has experience with. As company owner Jeroen Steenbakkers explains, the firm works with anonymized data to make it impossible to track who’s who. Another concept for gathering data at street level is a “smartbox” mounted on the roof of a vehicle and engineered to record information on things like air quality, light pollution and building efficiency. “You could use a garbage truck that drives down every street,” points out Jean-Pierre Morelli, head of business development at ENGIE Services, which specializes in low-carbon energy solutions and has been collaborating with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences on the smartbox concept. “I think all cities are becoming smart. Clearly, nobody wants to be a dumb city,” quips Mikkers, noting that Den Bosch is proud of its first data university, ​the Jheronimus [Bosch] Academy of Data Science. One way for cities to see how they measure up is rankings, and these are inspiring, finds Carabias. “Competition always helps you to be more innovative. If your city is behind another, you can look at the other cities to see what they’re doing better. Could you adopt some of their activities or measures?” he asks. However, the rankings tend to focus on big cities, which generally have more resources to develop strategies. So as part of his master’s thesis at ZHAW, Philipp Arnold decided to create an index that would be helpful for small- and medium-size towns. He based it on the areas defined in the smart city wheel by American urban and climate strategist Boyd Cohen: economy, environment, government, living, mobility and people. “The goal is for cities to be able to see how far their peers are in a given area – so that maybe they can even visit and ask them how they got there,” explains Arnold, who won an award for his work at the SGES2020. A sense of competition can also be a stumbling block, believes Daniel Krebs, head of sustainability at Swiss consulting firm Bluehub. “There’s a fair amount of ego when there should be collaboration. I think we could achieve more if municipalities cooperated more,” finds Krebs, suggesting that government regulations are needed to help achieve smart city goals. Urs Meuli of the Swiss energy office says it should be more about voluntary action than government regulations. But he notes that by 2030, “the goal is to get all cities onboard” the national program that supports municipal efforts to get smart and also find their way into the “2,000-Watt Society” – a concept developed by Swiss federal technology institute ETH in Zurich. The idea is for everyone to limit their energy consumption to 2,000 watts per year, the world average. The Swiss average is currently three times higher. With crises such as climate change and Covid-19, many would agree that it’s high time cities got smart. In keeping with the 2015 Paris Agreement, numerous countries including Switzerland have set themselves the target of net zero emissions by 2050. In the meantime, the Swiss government wants to halve the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 – as outlined by the federal CO2 law. However, the Alpine nation is already behind schedule. The federal environment office has reported that Switzerland will probably fail to meet its 2020 goal of cutting emissions down by 20% from what they were in 1990. Wherever countries and cities may be on their journey to becoming smarter and more sustainable, Dutch Ambassador to Switzerland Hedda Samson highlights the importance of sharing best practices and dilemmas: “We need a green recovery. This is a once in a lifetime chance and we have to build back better.”
2020-10-04;Half of Swiss would get vaccinated against Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/half-of-swiss-would-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/46075298;If there were an efficient vaccination against coronavirus, every second person in Switzerland would take it, says a survey. Men would be more likely to do so than women. Some 54% of respondents said they would get vaccinated, 41% said they would not, and 5% did not commit themselves, according to a representative survey published on Sunday by the SonntagsZeitung and Le Matin Dimanche. It was carried out online at the end of September among around 15,300 people nationwide. While 61% of the men questioned were in favour of vaccination, only 48% of the women were. Of those over 65, who are more vulnerable, 70% would agree to be vaccinated, while only 45% of those aged 18-35 would agree to it. Those on the political left were most likely to be willing to be vaccinated, with two-thirds of Social Democrat voters saying they would get the jab. However, the proportion of those who would be vaccinated was still 41% among supporters of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party. Around two-thirds of the respondents came from German-speaking Switzerland, almost a quarter from French-speaking Switzerland, and the rest from Italian-speaking Ticino. The survey was conducted between September 24-27.Comparing this survey result to numbers published by the World Economic Forum External linklast month shows that worldwide, Switzerland is among the countries with the lowest rates of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance. (The survey methodologies were slightly different).  On September 18 Switzerland confirmed its participation in the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative aimed at ensuring equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines when they are approved. It will thereby secure vaccines for 20% of the population. The aim is to procure two billion doses of vaccines from a range of manufacturers by the end of 2021. Switzerland will contribute CHF20 million ($22 million), the government said. In addition, so-called self-financing countries – that is, higher-income countries such as Switzerland – may contribute additional funds to secure Covid-19 vaccines for their own populations. Switzerland has also signed a contract with the US firm Moderna Therapeutics for the purchase of 4.5 million doses of vaccine and is talking to other vaccine manufacturers.
2020-10-04;‘Switzerland is sending a dangerous signal to the world’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-switzerland-is-sending-a-dangerous-signal-to-the-world-/46067960;"With its new anti-terror legislation, Switzerland could well provide a model for authoritarian regimes who want to clamp down on opposition figures. Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, the United Nations special rapporteur for counter-terrorism and human rights, voices her concerns.  Almost 20 years ago, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency following the terrorist attacks against the United States. It is still in force. What does that mean for the rule of law in a democracy?For the last twenty years, we have seen the state of emergency becoming the new normal. Not only in the US. The September 11 attacks led to structures to combat terrorism worldwide which take little account of human rights or the rule of law. Even at the level of the UN. Is the UN not paying attention to human rights or the rule of law in some respects? In the aftermath of 9/11, a committee was created, a sub-group of the UN Security Council, actually a clone of it, with the same 15 members: the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The member states committed to improve their counter-measures against terrorism based on the rule of law following 9/11, and to submit reports to the CTC on this. Yet whereas reports to the UN Human Rights Council are often submitted late or incomplete by the states concerned, but still show what states are actually doing with regard to human rights, the reports of the CTC are kept secret. Nobody can see them. The committee reviews these reports, then they just disappear. We do not know if a state has ever been censured because it misused measures to combat terrorism against its own civilian population, or against media or opposition figures. What we do know is an interesting fact: in contrast with the dysfunctional impression given by the Security Council, the members of the CTC are always in agreement. So what does that mean?I talk about human rights “light”. States and committees, even UN committees, sometimes seem to think that you only have to mention “human rights” and suddenly they exist as if by magic. Whereas in reality there is no obligatory mechanism to ensure that human rights are upheld. Human rights “light” means that human rights play a role just because they are referred to, but not because there is any attempt, with transparency or concrete mechanisms, to ensure that they are being upheld. So is the UN part of the problem?Not the UN itself, but the member states. Through the Security Council they have created a committee – the only UN committee that looks at anti-terror actions on a regular basis – which is still secret. This is in fact a deep-seated problem. We published a report two years ago which focussed on this normalisation of emergency by states following 9/11. There are any number of examples, like the state of emergency which [Turkish] President Erdoğan declared after the failed putsch against him and which ended up becoming the everyday legal norm. This is a change in the basic practice of states: emergency legislation becomes normal legislation. Erdoğan still talked in terms of a state of emergency; and after the terror attacks in Paris, France brought in emergency legislation, the name of which indicates that this is an extraordinary measure, that rights are abolished because the state is dealing with an acute crisis. However, these laws are now being voted in as if they were normal laws, without being flagged as laws of exception which give the state extreme powers and are therefore timebound. This harmful practice is now a problem worldwide. With the pandemic, the problem has worsened again, because many states are now using their emergency powers and anti-terror apparatus to deal with Covid-19. Can you be more explicit about this?There were states that had to devise special new legislation because of Covid-19, to get the crisis under control. Ireland was one example; France was another. These emergency pieces of legislation were needed to be able to clamp down temporarily on people’s freedom of movement during the worst of the health crisis, or freedom of expression, or privacy, or economic freedom. Other states were able to deal with the crisis just by invoking existing legislation which had been brought in to combat terrorism. We have been working with two NGOs to set up a “civic freedom tracker” so as to document the restrictions invoked in the different countries. One can see quite clearly that there are a number of countries using Covid-19 as an excuse to curb the power of their own democracies considerably over time. Can you give an example?Hungary. At the outset of the pandemic, [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán created a new structure of executive power. All decisions in the state have to go through his office. The Council of Europe has made it clear that this kind of thing is incompatible with the foundations of a democracy. The UN’s strategy to combat terrorism has four main strands to it. One of them is to ensure that, at the same time, the human rights of all are respected, and that the rule of law is the fundamental basis for this kind of action. Can democracies fighting against terrorism still afford human rights, or have they the will to do so? What answer do you have to those who say that we can’t give legal rights to people who are trying to massacre us as we sit in the local café?I grew up in Northern Ireland, where we lived through an armed conflict that went on for decades. I speak here as someone for whom violence and fear were an everyday reality and not just an abstract threat. But I have to tell you very clearly, and I say it to everyone who may want to claim that human rights stand in the way of effective countering of terrorism: only when you fight terrorism with the powers of the rule of law will you be able to end the violence. If in the fight against terrorism you break the law and trample human rights underfoot, then you’re getting into an endless war you can never win. Innumerable studies and evaluations have shown how harmful state abuses in this kind of situation are. They all show that the never-ending spiral of violence, the numerous conflicts with armed groups which can get very destructive, are not just prolonged by the above-the-law actions of the states involved, but are actually intensified. Does that mean that, even from a security point of view, it’s a bad idea to disregard human rights and the rule of law?We know today beyond the shadow of a doubt that one of the biggest problems in countering terrorism are actions above the law by the states involved in these conflicts. So yes, even from a security perspective, it is very shortsighted to overlook human rights violations or take part in them. All these states are doing is just fanning the flames. You say that if we want to break out of the spiral of violence, the state must obey the law. You say that, when the head of the CIA is Gina Haspel and we know that she ran a secret prison in Thailand where people were tortured, and she still has no problem with that. What does it mean when we know that torture doesn’t get you put in jail but the opposite: that in the most powerful country in the world it can actually be good for your career?As an academic I have repeatedly emphasised that it is incompatible with a democratic state to appoint someone to an office like that who has been responsible for implementing torture. The message of this to governments around the world can only be: “It is open season. Torture is allowed. There are no consequences.” At the same time, I am involved in dialogue with many different states. Quite a few are horrified at the idea that people involved in torture are promoted instead of being held accountable for their crimes. Our duty is always to be reminding people that Gina Haspel has been responsible for torture. And it is our duty to be aware that the rule of law takes its time. In Guatemala or Argentina, for example, it took twenty or thirty years to bring torturers to justice. But it did happen. That brings me back to the core of the issue: nobody is above the law. I am not prepared to exclude the possibility that at some time in the future in the US, the law will hold certain people to account, even holders of high office. And in the meantime?In the meantime we go on working with the states who believe in these values and who promote them and are convinced that their societies are safer and better protected when human rights are respected. As part of my UN mandate, I work a great deal with secret services, police and military forces – the security sector. Many of them understand that it is counterproductive to decide to ignore human rights. Many do not regard security and human rights as two things that are unrelated. Frequently people agree that security and respect for human rights are inseparable, and indeed depend on one another. Nonetheless, almost any toughening of laws in this area seems to get voted through by national parliaments. In this country too. It’s as if society had got used to the idea that the rule of law on its own is powerless to defeat terrorism.This tendency is not new, which doesn’t of course make it right. Aharon Barak, who was at first the Israeli attorney general and then the chief supreme court judge in his country, said it was the great challenge for democracies to have to fight with one hand tied behind their backs. Democracies that followed the rule of law tended to think that they were at a disadvantage compared to states that did not play by the rules. This, Barak said, turns out to be the crucial point: they are not fighting with the same weapons. There is a difference. And it is important to emphasise this difference as societies that want freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and individual privacy: we don’t want 100% security, because we could only have such total security if we gave up all our rights. What does that mean for the present time of coronavirus?One of the main challenges of this “corona moment”, which our societies are having to deal with, is to find a balance between restrictions and the right of citizens to live a full and free life. International law expressly provides for this. States have to have the right to suspend the citizens’ rights in a major emergency for a brief period. The point is: at some time it has to stop. In May, the UN warned Switzerland over the draft of its anti-terrorism legislation. You and the UN again recently warned Swiss parliamentarians against voting through the anti-terror bill. [On September 23, both chambers of Swiss parliament approved the reforms to the anti-terrorism law]. Your recent criticism was quite blunt: “Switzerland’s draft anti-terrorism legislation violates international human rights standards by expanding the definition of terrorism, and would set a dangerous precedent for the suppression of political dissent worldwide.” Why do you have such a problem with this legislation?This legislation alters the definition of terrorism. As regards human rights, the rule of law and indeed the current situation in the world, that is central and of crucial importance. There are other points, which are a cause for great concern, such as, that children could also be penalised under this law. But the crucial sticking point is the new definition of terrorism, which differs from the consensus of international law and indeed belongs to an existing model about which there can be no illusions. This definition of terrorism is used by authoritarian states to suppress dissent. What exactly is different here?Terrorism in Switzerland will no longer have to involve serious crime. There is new mention of people who are considered a danger as “potential terrorists”. The language of the bill makes it clear: this is no longer about terrorist acts, but the potential danger of them – which is a vague notion. In legal terms it is highly questionable, for it opens the door to abuse. All the more so because this Swiss legislation also provides for “potential danger” to be decided on not by a court of law, but by the federal police. Just imagine what that would mean in an authoritarian state. This is all linked to administrative provisions which could even affect children. There are measures that could massively restrict their freedom of movement although they have committed no crime. That to my mind is a violation of article 5 of the European Human Rights Convention. And that is just part of the problem. What’s the other part of the problem?Switzerland is a democracy. And not just any democracy. You may forget that Switzerland was historically among the most important states when it came to holding other states to account if they misused their powers under the cover of countering terrorism. The signal Switzerland is now sending is the opposite. Switzerland is signalling to other states – and don’t underestimate the fact that this signal is coming from Switzerland – that broad, vague, imprecise definitions of terrorism that you can interpret as you please are all fine and allowable. And that’s very dangerous. For history shows that this means preparing the ground for authoritarianism. It happens again and again that states misuse anti-terror legislation. And we are very concerned that Switzerland – historically in first place when it came to defending precise, narrow, legally adequate definitions of terrorism – is sending a dangerous signal out into the world. Into what kind of world?Think of Hong Kong. China is now calling anyone who criticises the government in Hong Kong a terrorist, or pursues them with anti-terror measures. Here we are saying clearly: such a vague interpretation of the concept of terrorism is not admissible. In Saudi Arabia, anti-terror legislation was used to imprison women who were agitating for the right to drive. In Turkey, lawyers, professors, journalists and human rights activists are being imprisoned after being accused of terrorism. That can happen because the concept of terrorism is no longer defined in terms of acts of violence, but can mean almost anything. Switzerland is now giving the green light for this kind of abuse, indirectly, when it interprets terrorism in the same vague manner. In Egypt two weeks ago, the human rights lawyer Bahey el-Din Hassan was sentenced to fifteen years in jail by an anti-terrorism court, because he had criticised the government. What did he actually say?He accused the government of misusing vague anti-terror laws to muzzle the opposition. Since 9/11, action to combat terrorism has developed exponentially in the Western world, with laws being toughened and wars being waged against terrorism. Is the world now a safer place, twenty years later?It’s a good question: have all the actions that have been taken since 9/11 made us freer or safer? From the point of view of my mandate, I cannot just say “yes”. We have seen the rise of powerful, violent non-state actors, which have committed huge human rights violations: Islamic State. We have seen other massive, systematic violations of human rights: Guantanamo Bay. Systematic illegal renditions, disappearances, systematic torture, water­boarding. Guantanamo is still in operation. In 2017, I was there as legal counsel. I saw with my own two eyes how people are held there without any legal basis and are exposed to torture and degrading treatment. At the same time, our security apparatus seems to have exploded. Civil rights are being abolished. In that sense: no. It is no longer clear to me whether we intend the goal to be to combat terrorism, and prevent violence and radicalisation. I am not even sure any more if that is really the goal. Jelani Cobb, professor of journalism at Columbia University, who writes for the New Yorker magazine, tweeted on the anniversary of the terror attacks on New York: “There’s a good book to be written about the ways in which the events of September 11, 2001 have led us directly to the chaos of the current moment.”9/11 cast a long shadow. 9/11 led to the UN constructing a whole new anti-terror architecture, which has had consequences for the integrity and balance of the whole organisation. The inflated role that the fight against terrorism has since occupied at the UN, together with the lack of integration of the role of human rights in the organisation in this regard, is a global legacy of 9/11. Another legacy, at the national level, is the massive increase in action taken to combat terrorism, including in the democratic states. Even the Swiss legislation we have been talking about is a legacy of 9/11. It is the result of a huge increased pressure on national parliaments to pass new legislation on countering terrorism, often in a shortsighted and ineffective manner. What kind of emotions did 9/11 stir up among the general public?9/11, but also the bomb attacks in London, the attacks in Madrid, the horror in Paris, the horror in Brussels, filled people with a profound fear. As a result of this fear many people have lost faith that the rule of law is able to protect them. That may be the biggest challenge we are facing today. We are dealing with a public opinion that has become convinced, after all the horrors we have been through, that our fear justifies any means. We have to reconvince this public opinion that the cry for more draconian laws, the militarisation of society, is not going to make us any freer or safer. What’s the alternative?The only way for a security that can last is in the old-fashioned rule of law, in the maintaining of human rights. We need to find out the reasons for the violence which is affecting us. In Northern Ireland we learned that lesson. Had to learn it. It was a long road. But in the end it was not military or legislative escalation that freed us from violence, but a peace agreement, achieved after a long-drawn-out process. The communities most affected by massive violence were involved in that. Step by step we found out and documented what was the cause of violence, and then that was dealt with – in a way that was clearly effective, after thirty years of terror.

2020-10-03;Covid sceptics form chain on Swiss-German border;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-sceptics-form-chain-on-swiss-german-border/46074680;Critics of restrictive coronavirus measures have formed a human chain on the shores of Lake Constance, straddling Switzerland and Germany. Counter-protests also took place on Saturday. The protestors tied themselves together with scarves, bits of cloth or ropes. The human chain stretched on both sides of the border through a park in the German city of Konstanz to Kreuzlingen in Switzerland. The police spoke of a “very calm” situation and reported about 1,000 participants in the Konstanz area. The organisers had initially planned for some 15,000 people and were aiming to go around the lake as far as Austria, which, according to television channel n-tv, seemed “very, very difficult”. In Kreuzlingen about 60 left-wing demonstrators marched peacefully past the chain of Covid deniers. Signs on banners included “Spread love, not coronavirus” and “Nazis out – masks on”. Charis Kuntzemüller from the Social Democratic Party Kreuzlingen warned that, under the guise of the pandemic, extremist and racist groups would also join in. That is what the left was protesting against, she said. “We stand behind the measures of the Federal Office of Public Health,” she added. Around 30 rallies have been approved for Saturday and Sunday in Konstanz and Kreuzlingen. 
2020-10-03;SWISS boss reckons with 1,000 job losses over two years;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-boss-reckons-with-1-000-job-losses-over-two-years/46074492;The CEO of Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) expects the company to cut 1,000 jobs within two years. Thomas Klühr says this cost-cutting plan could be achieved through a hiring freeze, part-time working arrangements and early retirement. “If fluctuations change as they have in recent years, these three methods could make it possible to eliminate the 1,000 jobs without layoffs,” Klühr said in an interview with the Schweiz am Wochenende newspaper. The coronavirus pandemic has paralysed air traffic, plunging airlines into the red. SWISS, a subsidiary of German company Lufthansa, expects its business to decline by 20% in the medium to long term. The reduction of 1,000 jobs should suffice in this context, Klühr said. However, if the situation doesn’t improve, particularly for long-haul flights, redundancies could no longer be ruled out, he added. It would become clear in the first quarter of 2021 whether these measures had been enough or not. SWISS is currently losing CHF1.5 million-CHF2 million ($1.6 million-$2.2 million) a day, said Klühr, who on September 29 announced he would stand down at the end of the year. The government’s numerous quarantine rules were tantamount to a second lockdown for the company, he said. “If they continue for months, SWISS will have a serious problem. The airline can hit its targets only if these rules are lifted.” Klühr said SWISS had approached the government and requested that the quarantine rules be replaced by pre-departure testing. Lufthansa wants to test this solution on a few routes. A test could also be carried out at SWISS. He said the government had expressed understanding. 
2020-10-03;Trump Covid diagnosis: Papers unsurprised and unsympathetic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/trump-covid-diagnosis--papers-unsurprised-and-unsympathetic/46074368;US President Donald Trump’s announcement that he has Covid-19 has filled Swiss newspaper frontpages. Commentators conclude that Trump’s history of lying, ignorance and selfishness have come back to haunt him. But what does it mean for next month’s election?   “Nobody wishes the president any ill, […] but nobody has been surprised by his infection,” said the Tages-Anzeiger in Zurich on Saturday. On Friday Trump moved to a military hospital for treatment after being diagnosed with Covid-19. His wife Melania and communications adviser Hope Hicks also tested positive. “Right from the beginning Trump treated the pandemic with a mixture of arrogance and ignorance. Like Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro [other populist leaders who contracted Covid-19], he mocked the ‘China virus’ and politicised the disease like no other politician,” the paper wrote. It pointed out that Trump, 74, hasn’t always been so truthful about his health – and as a result has frittered away trust. “This is why he is met with scepticism, even after his coronavirus infection,” it said. “Despite this, Trump’s entourage has learnt nothing. Although he is being treated with the highest possible dose of an as-yet-unapproved drug [remdesivir], his infection is ‘mild’. As a result, suspicions and rumours were coming thick and fast last night. This speculation was driven by the realisation over the past four years that he can never, ever be trusted. The more he denies something, the more likely it is to be true.” The Tages-Anzeiger said that when Trump unexpectedly went into hospital last year, the White House described it as a routine examination. “But Vice President Mike Pence was alerted and stood ready to take over. Trump later even referred to ‘mini-strokes’, which no one else had previously talked about.” The cover-up continued with the coronavirus infection, the paper said. “The fact that his advisor Hope Hicks was infected was made public by Bloomberg news agency not the White House.” In French-speaking Switzerland, the Tribune de Genève said the president’s infection was forcing pro-Trump America to confront its own vulnerability. “The end of the mirage created by Donald Trump in an attempt to minimise the pandemic has turned into a nightmare for him,” it wrote. “On Tuesday night in Cleveland he once again made fun of the size of his opponent Joe Biden’s mask. On Friday he was holed up in the White House, forced to consider the risks of the disease and cancel his meetings – just as he is behind in the polls.” The Tribune de Genève said that with just a month to go before the presidential election the Americans most exasperated by Trump’s attitude towards the pandemic may find it hard to resist mockingly citing the “no more bullshit” placards waved in recent months by the president’s supporters. “Many others will shake their head in disgust at the scale of the disaster that has already claimed more than 208,000 lives in the United States while the president pretended it didn’t exist.” “Even though the news of Trump’s hospitalisation dropped in the US like a bomb, it’s important to keep things in proportion,” said the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ). “Breathless speculation that the disease will kill the president and perhaps a significant portion of the US leadership is misplaced. Thanks to excellent medical care, the risk of Trump’s death is very low. Equally exaggerated is the fear that a foreign state could use the moment to act against America’s interests somewhere in the world. The US state apparatus is working normally, probably even more smoothly without the daily commotion emanating from the Oval Office.” However, the NZZ pointed out that the diagnosis would have a serious impact on the election campaign. “Leading a campaign from hospital is an enormous challenge. On the one hand this applies to the logistics: Trump’s trademark – fiery appearances in front of rapturous supporters – is out of the question for the time being. Personal meetings with donors must also be cancelled, which could have financial consequences for the campaign. The next television debate with Democrat challenger Joe Biden, scheduled for mid-October, is still on the agenda but will probably have to be postponed or cancelled altogether. This means that Trump is running out of time. The election is only a month away. This would have been barely enough time to make up for the considerable deficit in opinion polls even without the latest bad news.” But what was probably even more serious for Trump, according to the NZZ, was that he was now losing control of the dominant campaign issues. “In the last few days before his illness he had done everything to push the pandemic and accusations of his political failure in the coronavirus crisis into the background. Regarding the progress made in vaccine development, his message was that an end to the epidemic was in sight and that nothing stood in the way of a new economic boom. Now, however, Covid-19 is back dominating the headlines.” Presidential elections are known for “October surprises” – cooked-up scandals and smears designed to turn the tide in favour of the likely loser, concluded the Tages-Anzeiger. “But whether this surprise will work is questionable. Trump’s mendacity, selfishness and inability to empathise make it difficult to sympathise with him,” it wrote. “More than that, surveys show that a clear majority of Americans see him as a deadly threat to democracy. For them, the most dangerous virus is not Covid-19, but Trump. He is more subversive. There will be a lot more pain before the president is removed from the nation’s insides.” 
2020-10-02;Vögele Shoes, hit by coronavirus, to lose 60 stores;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/voegele-shoes--hit-by-coronavirus--to-lose-60-stores-/46073164;Switzerland’s second-biggest shoe chain Vögele Shoes is to close 60 stores in the country owing to the effects of coronavirus and online competition, its boss has told the media.  The retailer, which has been owned by CCC of Poland since 2018, is to downsize from 160 stores to about 100 good stores , its CEO Max Bertschinger told Blick.ch in an article published on Friday. However, he did not say what this would mean for jobs.  Bertschinger blamed falling revenues, with sales having halved to CHF17 million ($18 million) during the coronavirus lockdown between April and the end of June. Vögele Shoes is also facing stiff competition from online retailers, especially from the ready-to-wear site Zalando. 
2020-10-02;Swiss ‘don’t fear second lockdown’ ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--don-t-fear-second-lockdown--/46072302;Most Swiss are not worried about the need for a new national lockdown to combat the coronavirus, a survey has found.  Nearly 70% said they did not fear this happening in the next six months, according to a survey of 15,342 people carried out at the end of September by the Tamedia publishing group. Respondents cited notably the economic and social consequences of a lockdown.  Only a small minority would accept a new lockdown. Sixteen percent said it could be an option but only if the hospitals were full, and 8% said they would support it, because as many deaths should be avoided as possible.   Asked what hurt the most during the spring lockdown, respondents put first giving up social activities such as visits to family and friends (30%), followed by the financial consequences (15%), giving up holidays and trips (9%) and sporting and/or cultural activities (7%). Fifteen percent said the situation had not bothered them.  A majority of the Swiss population (53%) support the government’s anti-coronavirus measures and eight out of ten people support the compulsory wearing of masks on public transport. Sixty-seven percent are in favour of compulsory masks in all indoor public spaces. These findings are similar to those of another recent survey conducted for Migros magazine.   However, only one in four people supports wearing a mask in the workplace.   People are only in favour of compulsory masks where many people are close together for a short time, such as in public transport,” says political scientist Lucas Leemann, who co-led the Tamedia survey. “A compulsory mask in the office, where the mask would have to be worn for more than eight hours, might be seen as disproportionate or as too much interference in everyday life.” 
2020-10-02;'I can't see Switzerland or the EU leaving the negotiating table';https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-i-can-see-neither-switzerland-nor-the-eu-leaving-the-negotiating-table-/46071828;"Relations between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) are well past the honeymoon period, although the Swiss people voted resoundingly against ending free movement last Sunday. It will take time before Bern and Brussels sign an institutional framework agreement, cautions Cenni Najy, a researcher and expert on European affairs at the University of Geneva. The president of the Swiss Confederation, Simonetta Sommaruga, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke on the telephone last Monday, one day after the Swiss people rejected the immigration restrictions initiative. The EU chief urged the Swiss government to make swift progress in concluding an institutional framework agreement, intended to regulate long-term relations between the 27-country bloc and Switzerland. Although the will to do so is there, the path ahead is fraught with obstacles, warns Najy who is also vice-president of the foreign policy think tank foraus.  Can the rejection of the immigration initiative by 62% of voters be interpreted as a clear sign that Swiss citizens support the bilateral track? It is a clear sign that people do not want another crisis on top of the coronavirus. With the pandemic, the Swiss have become aware of the need to work with our neighbours, that is, with the EU. This definitely helped swell the number of votes against the Swiss People’s Party initiative. The population overwhelmingly endorsed the bilateral track, in a pragmatic and cooperative approach. Does this clear result put the government in a strong position in pursuing negotiations with Brussels? The governing Federal Council is strengthened by this victory, which was not a foregone conclusion. However, this does not mean that the structural problems linked to the bilateral track can be resolved with the wave of a magic wand. We now have a final version of the institutional framework agreement, which has been under negotiation for years, but Switzerland is reluctant to sign it, deeming that several points still need to be clarified; and these are not mere details, but important, even major, issues. One might well question whether renegotiation would not be more appropriate than simple clarification.   Attacked from all quarters in Switzerland, does the institutional framework agreement still have a future? On both the EU and Swiss sides, there is still a certain will to find solutions and conclude this long negotiation process. However, the Swiss government has its work cut out for it in overcoming the many divisions that have emerged in recent months, if not to say years, across the political spectrum. It will have to explain what has been negotiated and whether the fears expressed are justified or not, all the while trying to find common ground on outstanding issues with the EU. Is a complete renegotiation of the agreement unrealistic? As far as I can see there will be no full-fledged renegotiation of the agreement, but rather adjustments to the present version. Switzerland and the EU have been talking about this for nearly ten years. The EU will not accept a complete overhaul of the negotiation process just because Switzerland has internal problems. This would take so long that Brussels would probably rather have no agreement at all than this scenario. The People’s Party has already announced that it will wage its next battle against the institutional framework agreement, as it threatens the country’s sovereignty. Is this fear founded? In actual fact, the agreement will hardly change anything compared with the situation today. Switzerland generally voluntarily adopts any developments in European law relevant to the bilateral agreements. There are, however, a few exceptions, where it has not aligned itself, in particular with regard to the European citizenship directive. Adopting this would give more rights to EU residents coming to work in Switzerland. In concrete terms, it would make it a little more difficult for the Swiss authorities to deport criminals coming from the EU. However, the number of cases per year could be counted on the fingers of one hand. These are emotional issues, matters of principle, but which, to my mind, would have little real impact on the country’s sovereignty. The accompanying measures, meant to address the problem of wage dumping in particular, are the focal point of criticism from the left. Can a solution be found? This is the most problematic point in my view. Over the past 20 years, Switzerland has implemented a number of measures that accompany free movement. According to most experts, they provide real protection against wage dumping. These legal provisions work well, but they are not fully EU-compatible. If they were to fall by the wayside, the left would cut its strong support for the bilateral track and the free movement of people. And, without the left, the government would no longer have the political support needed to pursue the bilateral track.We could introduce new accompanying measures in line with EU law, but for that the social partners like the unions would have to sit around the table. And so far, there has not been the will to do so. If Switzerland is unable to find a solution, might it decide to drop the whole exercise? I can't see Switzerland or the EU leaving the negotiating table. The government does not want to bear responsibility for the failure of the talks. We are now in a waiting game. The institutional agreement contains major principles to which the EU is very attached. It would be unrealistic to hope that we could scrap everything and start over again and that these principles would vanish. If there is no will to move forward on both sides, the agreement will remain as it is for several months, even years, until the situation in Switzerland changes or the EU is more willing to make concessions. It makes more sense to wait for the various issues to be ironed out than to start again from scratch. In any event, I do not think a framework agreement will be signed before the end of the year."
2020-10-02;How the world’s most frequent voters handle postal ballots;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-the-world-s-most-frequent-voters-handle-postal-ballots/46070666;"Switzerland, where citizens vote four times a year, has a longstanding tradition of mailing its ballots. How did that play out during a pandemic? Mainly out of habit, when covering votes like the one held recently, journalists often write sentences like: “Swiss voters on Sunday will decide the fate of x” or “citizens head to the polls this weekend to vote on y”. But this is a bit misleading. Around 90% of ballots are already cast before the official voting day, by post: the results are often already settled – they’re just sitting in post offices and municipal count centres across the country, waiting to be tallied. On the day before the most recent Swiss nationwide referendum, vote officer Jürg Billwiller could be found marshalling his troops at one such centre, in Oberwinterthur near Zurich: his 30-odd counting staff sit at the ready, two to a table in the meeting hall of the Protestant church. It’s low drama, but dutiful. The counters – paid volunteers – alternate between leafing through documents and watching their partners leaf through documents. Four eyes are needed on each ballot to raise accuracy and prevent fraud. Some chat, others wear headphones, all are wearing masks. By mid-afternoon, they have finished verifying one of the two elements of the Swiss postal vote system: the “voter cards” that must accompany a ballot, signed as proof of identity. Then they start on the ballots themselves, containing votes on five national and two cantonal issues. They remove them from the envelopes, inspect them, and sort them. But no counting! Billwiller says. It’s still only Saturday: the real tally must wait a bit. For now, they remove the dud ones (illegibles, expletives, blanks) and arrange the good ones (marked “Ja” or “Nein”) into expectant piles. The totting will be done tomorrow, both by hand and by a banknote counting machine. Hefty plastic boxes sit on the floor, bunches of documents arranged in piles of 100 sit on the converted stage. A 10-minute break is called, then it’s back to work. It’s all very orderly. How many votes has Billwiller run here over the years? Many, he says, many, he doesn’t remember… He and his team are one of thousands of cogs in the nationwide system that makes it possible for “vote Sundays” – the quarterly highlights of the Swiss direct democracy year – to run smoothly. September 27 was particularly busy, with five issues on the ballot, because those that should have been up for a vote in May were postponed amid the Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, preparation and sorting means things move fast: by noon, when polls close, results start to trickle in immediately. Then, despite the multiple national, regional, and local votes on each ballot (in Oberwinterthur there was also one exclusively for Protestant churchgoers), results are confirmed within a few hours. The whole process starts about four months beforehand, explains Stephan Ziegler, head of votes and elections in Zurich, the largest Swiss canton. Each of the 26 cantons – responsible for organising vote logistics – receives the list of national issues on the ballot from federal authorities and starts preparing informational brochures for its citizens. Eight weeks out, municipalities then start printing ballots according to the electoral register; these arrive via post three to four weeks before vote day, along with the brochures. Citizens can mail them back up until shortly before the Sunday vote. “It’s a very established process,” Ziegler says. “There are no preconditions for voting by post – [the ballot] just arrives at your house.” First introduced in the late 1970s as an effort to boost low voter turnout, postal voting was anchored in Swiss law in 1994. By 2006, all 26 cantons had introduced functioning systems. “It works well, so there’s not much debate about it,” says Uwe Serdült, a political scientist at the University of Zurich. Cantons report that around 90% of citizens now vote by post, and some have reported figures up to 97% (Aargau, 2017). There were debates about security in the early years of postal voting, Serdült says – as there are now around e-voting. But over the years it has been accepted, largely due to the high levels of trust in Switzerland – “vis-à-vis the state, and in the postal system”. The turnout goal has also been achieved – somewhat. A 2007 study estimated a boost of around 4.1% after introducing postal voting, on top of a 43% average turnout between 1970 and 2005. But overall participation remains low, and it can’t entirely be attributed to the hassle of traipsing to a polling station on a wintry morning. Rather, experts say it’s because of the high frequency and complexity of Swiss votes. And for those like Billwiller who still enjoy the experience of casting their vote in person – or for those who forget to vote by post – the option to go to a polling place the day of the vote still exists, and is not likely to die out anytime soon. But this time around, the coronavirus meant some places were keen to push postal voting more than usual. In Bern, billboards around the city showed a vote-carrying pigeon encouraging citizens to “stay healthy and vote by post!”, and a flyer encouraging postal voting was sent with every ballot. Those efforts in the Swiss capital seemed to work, with city authorities this week reporting a jump in postal votes from 87.7% in February (the previous national ballot) to 93.3%.  Other parts of the country have also reported marginal increases in votes cast by mail between this ballot and earlier ones: from 90% to 92.6% in canton Zurich, 93% to 93.5% in Ticino, and from just under 95% to just under 96% in Basel City.  Meanwhile, overall participation on September 27 was up hugely: at nearly 60% it was one of the best turnouts in decades. In Oberwinterthur, the number of postal votes went up by 1.5%, to just over 90%. But the main effects of the pandemic were rather in the new working conditions. Normally, Billwiller would have had double the number of workers. They also wouldn’t have to sit so far apart, or wear masks. And normally they would be a mix of ages, he says. He looks around: all young this year – they couldn’t risk using anyone at higher risk for Covid-19 complications. Of course, the postal voting system, like Swiss democracy itself, isn’t always perfect. About 30,000 of the 780,000 Swiss citizens living abroad didn’t receive or couldn’t return their ballots for the latest vote by post due to the pandemic’s impact on mail services. This left many infuriated, especially since one of the five national vote issues, on purchasing new fighter jets, was decided by fewer than 9,000 votes. Postal voting is becoming “more and more out of date”, says Jézael Fritsche, a spokeswoman for the Organisation of the Swiss Abroad. Because the Swiss abroad move around a lot, and because other postal systems can be less reliable than the Swiss one, expat citizens often complain they don’t receive their vote materials in time to vote. This amounts to “de facto discrimination” against them when it comes to exercising political rights, says Fritsche. She and her organisation will thus continue to push for an e-voting option, which right now is off the table following security failures in previous efforts to develop a Swiss e-voting system. But compared to with debates over postal voting elsewhere in the world, Switzerland’s problems with mailed ballots are “very limited in scope”, says Serdült of the University of Zurich. Fraud is rare but has happened. Last year, police questioned an employee from the Geneva electoral office over suspicions of destroying some ballots and adding others. In Bern, 300 votes in the 2016 local elections were declared void after investigators discovered they all had the same handwriting. Another possible problem is “family voting”. How common is it that the head of the household takes the ballots and fills them out for all family members? Or that somebody, without the secrecy of the ballot box to rely on, is coerced to vote a certain way? “In Swiss political culture we assume this [family voting] doesn’t happen, though it probably does,” says Serdült. “But it’s a non-issue, that is to say, an unknown”. Stamps are another minor but persistent issue. While some cantons send voting materials pre-stamped, others expect each voter to pay for return postage themselves. Does this affect turnout? The evidence is unclear, although Bern – which makes voters buy their own stamps – has recently raised the question in its city parliament. No such worries in Oberwinterthur, however. Postage is prepaid in canton Zurich, fraud cases are unheard of in the last decade, and Billwiller is happy with how things are going. Around 7,000 ballots have come in by Saturday afternoon, meaning a turnout already above 50% in his counting circle of around 14,000 citizens. Spoiled votes are uncommon, though he’s called on every now and then to make a legibility judgement. What’s the biggest problem that can turn up? Billwiller thinks for a moment but can’t seem to find an answer. Then a colleague arrives, holding up a mailed-in ballot with a puzzled expression. It’s from the previous local election, held during the summer. Too much democracy can also be confusing."
2020-10-01;Covid-19 quarantine period could be shortened, say experts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-quarantine-period-could-be-shortened--say-experts/46069842;A group of health experts has recommended shortening the quarantine period from ten days to six or seven for people entering Switzerland from Covid-19 risk countries. Their report has been sent to the government for the final say. Members of the national Covid-19 taskforce met on Tuesday at the Federal Office of Public Health to discuss the possible shortening of the quarantine period, Swiss public television, SRF, reported. “We have examined the question from a scientific angle,” epidemiologist Marcel Tanner told SRF. Their conclusions were reportedly sent to the government on Wednesday evening. Under Swiss regulations, anyone entering Switzerland from one of the countries on a listExternal link thought to have a high risk of coronavirus infection must go into quarantine for ten days to help curb the spread of Covid-19, or risk a fine. However, there have been pressures from business circles and the travel sector to shorten the quarantine period. SRF said a study by taskforce member Sebastian Bonhoeffer, a professor at the Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zurich, concludes that it would be possible to combine a shortened quarantine period with a Covid-19 test. According to Tanner, the taskforce is proposing to “shorten quarantine in complete safety if we carry out the necessary tests”. The period could possibly be reduced to seven days, with a test on the sixth day, Tanner said. Virologist Didier Trono shares their opinion. “After six or seven days the risk of contagion is much lower. It’s taking a relative risk as zero risk doesn’t exist. It’s a political decision, based on a risk evaluation,” he told Swiss public radio, RTS, on Wednesday. The final decision will fall to the governing Federal Council. Two weeks ago, Finance Minister Ueli Maurer told SRF that he expected the quarantine period to be shortened for people entering Switzerland from at risk countries. Similar debates have taken place in Switzerland’s neighbours Germany, France and Italy.
2020-10-01;Covid-19: mass events again allowed in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--mass-events-again-allowed-in-switzerland/46069678;Concerts, football matches, conferences and other large-scale public and private events of more than 1,000 people can take place in Switzerland from Thursday. But the organisers have to meet strict Covid-19 rules to ensure the public’s safety. On August 12, the government announced that events with more than 1,000 people – notably festivals and sporting events – would be again allowed from October 1. Since the spring, many of Switzerland’s biggest business and cultural events have been cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. The organisers of the events need permission by cantonal authorities, who base their decision on the epidemiological situation and available tracing capacities. Organisers also have to put in place protection measures. National football and ice-hockey matches – the most popular sports events in Switzerland – will be again allowed to admit spectators, who must wear face masks and be seated. The maximum number of tickets sold must not exceed two-thirds of the normal capacity. The sale of alcohol will be permitted. Events companies, and in particular sports clubs and associations, have been lobbying for restrictions to be lifted, arguing that many clubs and businesses would go bust if the 1,000-person limit remained in force. The easing comes despite recommendations by the government’s Covid-19 taskforce not to lift such restrictions for mass events. Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the government introduced sweeping restrictions on public life in March and started easing them gradually three months later. However, since mid-June the number of new cases of Covid-19 has been rising slowly. The average case count stands at just under 60 per 100,000 residents and the number of new daily infections is 315.4 (seven-day average). Interior Minister Alain Berset, who is responsible for health matters, said Switzerland was one of the first countries in Europe to authorise a return of mass events. “It’s another step towards normalising the situation without losing control,” he said in August. He stresses that the coronavirus situation is under control but that things could change quickly and that the population must “learn to live with the virus for some time”.
2020-10-01;Swiss National Bank figures show burst of franc-dousing interventions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-national-bank-figures-show-burst-of-franc-dousing-interventions/46069608;The Swiss National Bank (SNB) spent CHF90 billion ($97.8 billion) in the first half of the year, more than it has spent in the past three years combined, to hold down artificially the value of the wealthy alpine state’s currency. In official data released for the first time on Wednesday, the central bank said it sold CHF38.5 billion in the first three months of 2020, and a further CHF51.5 billion in the next three months, hoovering up dollar and euro-denominated assets. The data comes just days after SNB President Thomas Jordan signalled that even larger interventions may be on the cards in the future. Switzerland’s long-running battle with an overly strong franc has drawn criticism from the US, which has threatened to label the country a currency manipulator. But the SNB has long argued that its efforts to control the franc’s appreciation are critical to the health of the Swiss economy: a rapid rise in the currency’s value would be crippling to Switzerland’s large export-oriented manufacturing industry, the bank argues. It would also drag down already feeble inflation. The release of new quarterly data on interventions is seen as an effort to use enhanced transparency to mollify concerns over the strategy. The franc has been under sustained upward pressure, thanks to its status as a haven currency in times of stress. Quantitative easing in the US and the eurozone has forced the SNB to slash its interest rates to stymie capital inflows. Switzerland’s benchmark rate has been held at minus 0.75%, the lowest in the world, for the past five years. Still, the euro is hovering around CHF1.08, close to the franc’s strongest levels in three years. The SNB signalled at the end of 2019 that market interventions would be its main tool to fight the rising value of the franc in the future. With the onset of the coronavirus crisis, however, the bank was forced to take far bolder action than most economists expected. The central bank’s balance sheet is now closing in on $1 trillion in size: data at the end of August showed the bank held $950 billion in assets. Switzerland, a country of 8.5m people, has annual economic output of just over $700 billion. The central bank’s appetite for dollars has already made it one of the largest US equity investors in the world. SEC filings from the beginning of this year show the bank held a $4.2 billion position in Apple, $3.6 billion in Microsoft, $2.4 billion in Amazon and $1.6 billion in Facebook. The SNB bought another SFr40 billion of dollar-denominated assets in the first six months of this year, around CHF8 billion of which is likely to have been spent on US equities, according to the bank’s own allocation strategy. The equity portfolio has this year delivered bumper returns for the bank, even though officials stress they do not target profitability in their investment decisions, only liquidity needs. Still, some analysts question whether its credibility may take a dent if it is forced to book huge losses, and what the political consequences of that might be. Outsize gold holdings have also been another huge source of gains, as the precious metal rallied to a record high of $2,073 an ounce in August this year. The SNB currently owns around 1,000 tonnes of gold, worth about CHF59bn. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-09-30;Coronavirus: Is Switzerland learning from other countries?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus--is-switzerland-learning-from-other-countries-/46067324;The number of coronavirus cases rose steadily in Switzerland over the summer, but hospital beds remained empty. The experience of other countries, however, shows that this can change fast. Is Switzerland learning from the mistakes of others? In August, the Swiss public television, SRF, investigated why it was that hospital beds in Switzerland, like for example in Germany and Britain, were staying empty despite an increase in the number of people infected with Covid-19. Three likely explanations were found: The experience of countries such as Spain and France shows that the number of serious cases can shoot up anew, if we lose an overview of the spread of the disease and more older people get infected again. The onset of the cold weather, when people will once more be spending more time indoors, begs the question: How well does Switzerland have the situation under control? To try and answer this, we analysed the latest data and talked with an expert. To be able to map the current situation of the pandemic correctly, a functioning testing system is absolutely vital. It is now known that a significant proportion of Covid-19 infections lead to no symptoms at all or to very mild ones that are almost imperceptible. The testing system has been adapted over time. Thus, since April 22, anyone with symptoms can go and get tested, while since June 25 the Swiss government has taken over the cost of the tests. These and other changes to the system have meant more people being tested in Switzerland. But how much testing is really going on? Significantly more tests have been carried out since the beginning of September than over the summer, with a concomitant increase in the number of cases detected. So, is the count rising simply because more testing is being done? To answer this question, it is helpful to look at the so-called test positivity rate, that is, the fraction of all tests performed that come back positive. As long as this is below five percent, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), we are getting a reliable picture of the spread of the disease. The test positivity rate is currently below 5% but higher than in June and July. Emma Hodcroft is an epidemiologist and the co-developer of the open source platform Nextstrain, which tracks the mutations of SARS-Cov-2. In her view, the evolution of the positivity rate is a clear sign that infections are actually climbing and that the rise in case numbers cannot solely be explained by more testing. “I do think we need to be careful. 3-4% is fine but we don’t want that to continue to increase, she said. Over the summer, case numbers in many countries were rising fastest among the younger generation, especially 20 to 29-year-olds. This seems slowly to be changing again. Young people are still slightly overrepresented, compared to their one-third share of the population, but significantly less so than at the end of August. This does not surprise Hodcroft: “We will often have contact within our own age groups, but we don’t live in a society where we are restricted to only communication and being with people within our age group.” In her view, the best way to protect vulnerable groups of people is by keeping overall case numbers low. Since the disease often takes a less serious form among younger people, the number of hospital admissions remained low over the summer. In September, too, there has so far only been a slight increase in the older age groups. Hodcroft is convinced that this will change: “As those cases rise in older age groups, we expect to see an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. This can already be seen in other European countries, such as Spain and France. “It’s not really a hypothetical situation,” she remarks. Possibly one of the most inexplicable aspects of the whole pandemic, in Hodcroft’s opinion, is how little we are learning from developments in other countries. This was evident during the first wave: “Everyone looked at Italy and was like – oh that’s too bad for Italy, but it won’t happen here.” But in many countries it did happen. So what should we do? Being able to keep up contact tracing is essential, as it is the only way to interrupt infection chains early on. Doing so gets more difficult the higher the case numbers become. Hodcroft is concerned about particularly affected regions, such as canton Vaud, where contact tracers are gradually reaching the limit of their capacity. However, the positive side is that “a lot of the cases are concentrated in a few cantons,” she adds. If these cantons managed to bring the situation back under control, Switzerland would be in a very good position. At the moment, though, many cantons are reluctant to introduce new restrictions in order to contain the virus. Hodcroft attributes this not just to economic pressure but also to a lack of clear guidelines. “We’ve been very lucky with our weather in Europe,” says Hodcroft. But now autumn is definitely here. “With the cold weather we will be facing completely new challenges, she notes. Social distancing is easy when you are outside in the park, but it gets more difficult once you have to stay indoors. Translated from German by Julia Bassam. 
2020-09-29;Swiss public broadcaster to tighten belt amid falling revenues;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-public-broadcaster-to-tighten-belt-amid-falling-revenues/46065588;The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) says further job cuts are inevitable as advertising and license fee revenues continue to fall. The public broadcaster has also fleshed out future strategy details to meet evolving media consumption demands. SBC, which is swissinfo.ch’s parent company, must save CHF50 million ($54 million) by 2024, said Director-General Gilles Marchand on Tuesday. This comes on top of an efficiency programme launched in 2018 that saved CHF100 million. In the last three years, advertising revenues have decreased by CHF95 million, a deficit which is forecast to increase to CHF140 million in the coming years. This is partly due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The lockdown has accelerated the negative trend significantly,” said Marchand. License fee income fell by CHF50 million last year. In April, parliament agreed to increase SBC funding by CHF50 million to CHF1.25 billion per year. But Marchand said this would not be enough to cover future lost revenues. As a result, some 250 full-time posts out of a total 5,500 positions will have to be cut over the next four years. Some cuts may involve early retirements or employees moving on, but redundancies cannot be ruled out. Marchand also outlined strategic changes to SBC’s output given that 20% of the Swiss population does not access media through traditional radio and television channels. Online content will be further developed. In addition, SBC plans to launch its “Play Suisse” streaming platform featuring Swiss films, in-house series and documentaries. The German-speaking unit SRF is being transformed by a “complex, courageous and important project” called “SRF 2024”, which aims to “put the needs of our users at the centre of the content we offer,” Marchand said.
2020-09-29;Italy wants cross-border worker tax deal by end of year ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/italy-wants-cross-border-worker-tax-deal-by-end-of-year-/46065424;Meeting in Rome with Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he hopes to see a deal signed “as soon as possible” between their two countries on taxation of cross-border workers.  At a press conference on Tuesday both he and Sommaruga expressed satisfaction with progress made on such an agreement, which was negotiated in 2015 but has never been signed. Conte said he hoped it could be signed by the end of this year.  The Italian Prime Minister stressed the “precious contribution” of Italian cross-border workers to the health system in the southern Swiss canton of Ticino. He said the coronavirus crisis had highlighted its importance for Switzerland.   Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, said Switzerland had learned a lot from Italy on how to manage the crisis.  Both leaders welcomed the outcome of Sunday’s Swiss vote on immigration, in which citizens rejected ending free movement of people with the European Union.  In last Sunday's referendum, the Swiss people once again said that they want the free movement of people,” Sommaruga told journalists. “It is a good thing for our country but it is also a good thing for the whole of Europe.   And she said Switzerland intended to keep borders with Italy open, despite coronavirus. “With neighbouring countries, Switzerland has adopted a regional approach excluding border regions and also cross-border workers from the quarantine regime,” she said. “I hope we can continue like this.   
2020-09-29;Is the party over for the chalet holiday?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/is-the-party-over-for-the-chalet-holiday-/46062272;In the winter of 1958-59, a British 27-year-old travelled from London to the Swiss village of Grindelwald to take up a job. Lovedy Cornish, or Moule as she was then, would be looking after British tourists, mainly cooking and making beds, but she was also making history. For, though no one thought much about it at the time, Lovedy was the world’s first chalet girl. “We had the upstairs floor of a chalet, the bottom half was owned by a family who ran a hardware store,” she told me this month from her home in Cambridge. “The first group of guests included four public schoolboys, a nurse, a secretary, two American airmen and an English major who was drunken and amorous in turn. So it was what you might call a mixed group.” Prior to the second world war, skiing had been a holiday for a tiny clique of aristocratic enthusiasts who stayed at grand Victorian hotels in the Alps. But by the end of the 1950s the sport was beginning to appeal to a slightly wider group of young people hungry for adventure and fun after the years of postwar austerity. Since 1953, the travel industry pioneer Erna Low had been running ski “parties”, in which groups of Britons travelled to the Alps together with a host. But it was a former member of Low’s staff, Colin Murison Small, who came up with the idea of renting a chalet for a season, installing a host and sending out groups of guests by the week or fortnight. His 1958 brochure — three pages of typewritten and copied foolscap — offered “comfortable, though not luxurious or spacious” accommodation, catering including “tea with bread and butter and jam at no extra charge” and, crucially, free wine at dinner. “It wasn’t very good wine but they enjoyed it,” recalls Cornish, who knew Murison Small through a madrigal group they attended in London. “After dinner, people used to come into the kitchen and help wash up, they mucked in. And then they used to go out on the town, dancing and drinking too much, and I would go with them quite often.” The price — £31, including rail and ferry travel from Victoria station — was a relative bargain, but just as important was the atmosphere, the sense of being among friends rather than amid the starchy formality of an Alpine hotel. And for young Britons with little experience of foreign travel, there was a friendly helping hand as they battled with unfamiliar ski equipment and the rudimentary lift systems. So the model caught on and, while other nations took ski holidays as families or couples, for Britons winter sports became synonymous with sociable group holidays. Somehow the normal national reserve seemed to vanish after days in the fresh air. While sharing a dinner table with strangers each night would ordinarily be purgatory, the cosy wood-panelled surroundings and the chance to share tales of exploits on skis seemed to override any reticence. Or maybe it was just all the free wine. Now, though, after 60 years of high jinks, the chalet seems at risk of terminal decline, imperilled by a pernicious combination of coronavirus and Brexit. Earlier this month Crystal, the biggest British ski tour operator, announced it was cancelling its entire chalet programme for this year. Hotelplan UK (which operates hotels and chalets through the brands Inghams, Ski Total and Esprit Ski) says it has cut its roster of chalets from about 120 to 60. The trade body Seasonal Businesses in Travel (SBIT) says anecdotal evidence suggests a similar 50% cut, on average, across its 200 members. “I think it’s now inevitable that there will be very significant capacity reductions announced in the weeks ahead,” says Craig Burton, chief executive of the tour operator Ski Solutions. “It’s grim, to be honest — we’ve never faced down anything like this before.” As we enter what would ordinarily be the peak autumn booking period for British skiers, there are quarantine restrictions in place for almost all the key destinations, including France, Switzerland, Austria, the US and Canada. Whereas operators using hotels can switch to a last-minute booking model with little financial risk, those operating chalets need to commit to hiring staff and renting properties for the entire season. Brexit only increases the jeopardy, making it impossible for British companies to send out staff at short notice after January 1, should the quarantine situation improve. “We’re either in it from the start or we’re not,” says Anne Williams, head of marketing at Hotelplan UK. “There is a lot of pressure right now.” And while some companies could write off one winter, Brexit presents a bigger structural challenge to the entire model. Chalet companies have always relied on young British staff whose relatively low pay is boosted by the offer of accommodation, a lift pass, time to ski and plenty of fun. Almost all have been employed in the UK, where they pay tax and national insurance, while working in the EU as “posted workers”. According to SBIT, from January staff will have to be employed by companies registered in the host country and both employer and employee will pay social-security contributions locally, at significantly greater rates. All staff will need visas to work and stay and employers will need to demonstrate that local workers were unable to fill the role. “At the moment we understand the process of applying for those visas takes at least three months, with no guarantee at the end of it,” says Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director of Skiworld and spokesperson for SBIT. For a job only intended to last four months, that is a major logistical burden. Already some chalet operators have thrown in the towel. The last two months have seen the demise of the Val d’Isère-based Project Ski and SnowChateaux, which ran 22 catered chalets in the French Alps. “Even prior to the pandemic, quite a few SBIT members were feeling that the environment in Europe meant they couldn’t operate their business, so they were simply going to close at the end of this season,” says Palumbo. “There’s no big announcement, they just quietly disappear.” In Murison Small’s first season, guests would leave London at 9pm on a Friday, travelling out via Dunkirk, Basel and Interlaken and arriving at Grindelwald at 7.37pm the following day. On the return leg they left the station at 7.20pm on Saturday. “This gave Lovedy 17 minutes to clean the chalet between groups,” Murison Small told the Ski Club of Great Britain’s journal in 2003. The expansion of charter flights in the 1960s changed all that, simplifying logistics and perfectly dovetailing with the chalet’s weekly schedule: planes could travel out with one group, returning with the previous guests, so both airline seats and chalet beds remained full. As a result, catered chalets became the most popular accommodation choice for British skiers, a dominance that continued for decades. Even in 2007, the Ski Club of Great Britain found 37% of the 1.35m British skiers stayed in catered chalets, compared to 31% in hotels and 20% in self-catered apartments. For Britons, chalets — and the girls and boys who staffed them — became deeply entwined with perceptions of the sport. When the band Wham! wanted to capture some winter sports glamour for their 1984 hit “Last Christmas”, they set the video in a chalet in Saas Fee. The 2011 skiing romcom starring Felicity Jones and Ed Westwick was shot in St Anton and called, inevitably, Chalet Girl. Jenny Jones, who in 2014 became the first Briton to win an Olympic medal on snow, learnt to snowboard while working as a chalet girl in Tignes. Even Prince Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, once worked in a chalet in Verbier. “I think what made chalets special is that we made friends with our guests and we were part of their holiday,” says Julia Beldam, another former Murison Small employee who set up her own chalet company, Ski with Julia, in Verbier in 1974. “We sat and had dinner with them, we were there at breakfast, we chatted to them, skied with them, had a drink with them. The food was basic and the wine was revolting but it was just huge fun.” Where once there was a shared bathroom, thin partition walls and a rush to get the first bath before the hot water ran out, chalets grew increasingly luxurious. In 2007, Richard Branson opened The Lodge in Verbier, a property that blurred the lines between chalet and private hotel, with a swimming pool, Jacuzzi and private ice rink, a lift, gym, even a mini gift shop. At the time it was the most expensive chalet in the Alps, at £57,000 per week in peak season, a figure that has since been dwarfed by properties such as Chalet N in Oberlech, Austria, which sleeps 22 and costs up to £415,000 per week. Meanwhile, as the small chalet operators grew, they were able to gain economies of scale and offer prices that opened up skiing to a much wider demographic. “We got to the stage where we were ordering 77,000 litres of wine for the season,” says Palumbo. Thriving operators committed to leasing chalets on three-, five- or seven-year contracts, which again drove down prices. All now agree those days are over, that prices will rise and chalets will become scarcer. “It’s a lot more complicated to run chalets properly nowadays — you can’t just make it up as you go along like when I started 38 years ago,” says Nick Morgan, whose company Le Ski runs 33 chalets in the French Alps. “So I think it’s going to come full circle. Chalets started as a very specialist holiday, then became mass market and now it’s going to go back to being small-scale. In one way that’s fine but I think it’s a shame.” Even if some chalets remain, the future of the British chalet boy and girl looks more uncertain. Morgan says he plans to accept rising costs and red tape and keep employing UK staff (“It’s such a quintessentially British activity, I just think it wouldn’t be the same without them”) but others are already switching their efforts to recruit locally. Hotelplan UK says it foresees a hybrid model, with some jobs carried out by locals, others, such as specialist childcare, by Britons. “I just feel really sad about the loss of the opportunity for 18-35 year olds to experience a different culture, to travel, ski and then bring that knowledge back to the industry here,” says Palumbo. So far, she notes, SBIT members have struggled to recruit in other countries, because the job of the chalet boy or girl, with its blend of cooking, cleaning and hosting, is so unfamiliar. Some see a brighter future in offering more flexibility — allowing guests to self-cater but with the option of pre-prepared meals being delivered or chefs coming in on certain nights of the week. Others suggest a pivot from sociability to privacy, with a focus on smaller chalets being rented in their entirety. “Given how successful it has been all those years, I would have thought it will come back eventually,” says Lovedy Cornish. “Mind you, there might not be any snow by then.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020 
2020-09-29;One in ten people in Ticino exposed to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/one-in-ten-people-in-ticino-exposed-to-covid-19/46065320;Some 11% of people living in the southern Swiss canton of Ticino have been in contact with the Covid-19 virus, according to a study of antibodies in the blood. The rate has gone up from 9% when it was last measured in July. Ticino, which borders Italy, was one of the worst affected Swiss cantons and the first to show signs of the coronavirus crisis. As the pandemic wore on, other cantons leapfrogged Ticino in terms of positive tests. But the latest blood test study by the University of Applied Sciences of Italian-speaking SwitzerlandExternal link reveals that Ticino residents appear to top the table of Covid-19 antibodies. The latest study tested the blood of 8,000 residents since July. Researchers say this sample group can be interpreted as indicative of the population of the canton. This would translate into 23,000 people in Ticino out of a population of 210,000 having come into contact with the virus More than one in ten people aged between 20 and 64 displayed antibodies in their blood during the latest sample test. In the city of Locarno, 15% of all people tested had antibodies, while women between the ages of 20 and 35 were the highest affected group canton-wide. Blood tests in Geneva also showed an 11% rate back in April. Those carried out in the western canton of Vaud showed a 7% antibody rate, which falls to 4% in Basel and 3% in Zurich. As each canton carries out its own studies, it is difficult to say how comparable the results are between regions. Blood tests in Ticino will continue until at least June 2021. On Tuesday, the Swiss health ministry reported 225 new coronavirus cases across the country over the previous 24 hours. The current seven-day average is 327. 
2020-09-29;SWISS airline boss to quit at year’s end;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-airline-boss-to-quit-at-year-s-end/46064972;The CEO of Swiss International Air Lines, Thomas Klühr, will step down at the end of the year to take up a role on a new body that will monitor the government’s bailout of the industry. Klühr has led SWISS since February 2016 as part of a 30-year career at Lufthansa Group, which owns Switzerland’s national carrier. He is leaving his current post for “personal reasons”, read a SWISS statementExternal link. Klühr delayed his departure to steer the company through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated the airline industry. He will also resign as chairman of charter airline Edelweiss at the end of 2020. “Thomas Klühr has brought SWISS a long way further on its successful course. And following the outbreak of COVID-19, with his skill and his commitment he has played an essential part in stabilizing the company in financial and operational terms,” said SWISS chairman Reto Francioni. Klühr will take up a new position at the Swiss Aviation Foundation, a body that has yet to be created but will monitor the future development of the Zurich Airport hub. This was a condition set down by the government when it agreed to a nearly CHF1.9 billion ($2 billion) airline bailout in April. Nearly CHF1.3 billion of the funds will go to SWISS and Edelweiss. The government wants to make sure the funds are directed towards strengthening the industry in Switzerland rather than being spent elsewhere within the Lufthansa group. The government will appoint a chairman and two further members of the Swiss Aviation Foundation while Lufthansa and SWISS are to each appoint one member. Klühr will be one of these two people.
2020-09-29;The new gold rush: western investors offset soft eastern demand;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-new-gold-rush--western-investors-offset-soft-eastern-demand/46064488;Warren Buffett always mocked people who invested in gold, calling it a useless metal that “gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace” and a way of “going long on fear”. This year, however, the “sage of Omaha” joined investors including the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates in buying into the latest gold rush, which helped push prices to a record high this summer. During the second quarter, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought a $565 million (CHF522 million) stake in Barrick Gold, the world’s second-largest gold miner. Shares in Barrick, which mines in Africa, Latin America and the US, have risen 37% since the beginning of April. Also in the second quarter, Bridgewater invested in gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – which allow investors to buy physical gold like a stock – worth $316 million, according to company filings. Such interest from western investors has triggered a rise in the gold price from a low of $1,160 an ounce in the summer of 2018 to a record high of $2,073 in August, making the precious metal one of the best performing financial assets on the planet. Growing fears over the economic impact of coronavirus and negative bond yields have seen more than $60 billion invested in gold-backed ETFs this year, 50% more than in 2009 during the financial crisis. The pandemic has convinced investors that gold belongs in their portfolios as a hedge against frothy equity markets, rock bottom interest rates and a fall in economic output. Some large investors want gold as protection against possible deflation caused by an economic slowdown or a converse rise in inflation as governments pump money into the system, according to David Tait, chief executive of the World Gold Council. After initially falling in March as global stock markets collapsed, gold had rallied by 22% by the beginning of August. “It has focused a lot of people who had historically looked at gold as the Armageddon trade,” says Tait, “to look at it through a broader lens”. Yet in gold’s traditional heartlands of India and China, demand this year has been at best tepid, with buyers in the two biggest consumer markets selling their gold holdings, or borrowing against them as prices hit record highs in local currencies. In China, gold is selling at a $53 an ounce discount to global markets due to the weakness in domestic demand and restrictions on exports of the metal. With retail consumption a key signal of the commodity's strength for institutional investors, it is a divergence that could threaten gold’s rally if western demand wanes, as it did after the financial crisis when gold prices collapsed from a high of $1,920 an ounce in September 2011 to nearly $1,200 in 2013. Gold ETFs now make up 35% of global gold demand compared with just 8% a decade ago, but inflows have started to slow. The world’s largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Shares, registered withdrawals of money in September for the first time in eight months. An abrupt halt to gold’s rally would hurt some of the world’s largest investors and remove one of the few bright spots in global stock markets outside large technology shares. It would also lead to losses for retail investors who face an uncertain job market due to the pandemic and continued low interest rates on savings accounts. Gold prices have fallen 9% since August’s high, while shares in gold miners have fallen by 13%. “One risk [scenario] here is that Asian buyers put a floor under the market,” damaging the confidence of retail investors who had bought gold-backed ETFs, says Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, an online gold exchange. “But with demand being so abject in the big consumer nations where will that floor be?” Popley Eternal, a jewellery megastore in a busy neighbourhood of India’s financial capital Mumbai that has traded for nearly 100 years, typically caters to the bustle of customers shopping for gold necklaces and earrings ahead of weddings and festivals. Items start at around Rs50,000 (CHF625). But footfall has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels since the shop re-opened in June after the country’s strict coronavirus lockdown was lifted. The three-month lockdown brought virtually all economic activity to a halt. Suraj Popley, the owner, says the company has cut its staff by around a quarter to 20, with sales so low that any item sold in the current environment is considered a “bonus”. Indian consumers hurt by the economic fallout are opting instead to sell their family jewels or borrowing against the precious metal to make the most of high global prices. “People are coming to sell gold, in case they require cash, in case they require liquidity,” he says. “Very few people are coming to buy.” India and China combined account for more than half of global gold purchases. But demand fell by 56% in India in the first half of this year, according to the World Gold Council, and just over half in China, although Indian demand picked up in August. In India the precious metal plays a uniquely important role in family, festive and religious occasions. The South Asian country holds the largest stock of gold in the world, according to Swiss bank UBS, with 25,000 tonnes owned by households and stashed in temples. Even for investment, many Indians traditionally prefer to hoard the physical metal rather than buy into ETFs or other schemes. Gold jewellery confers status, while it can be bequeathed to children and pawned in times of need. “There is an affinity towards gold,” says Terence Lucien, head of mutual funds at PhonePe, a Bangalore-based digital payments start-up owned by Walmart. “The way Indians have bought it traditionally, there have been people buying in excess.” But demand for jewellery has plunged, hit first by the dramatic lockdown which forced retail outlets to close and now by the deep economic and public health blow the pandemic has dealt the country, which has recorded more than 5.8 million coronavirus cases and more than 92,000 deaths. Weddings have been postponed as India records more than 80,000 new infections a day while the economic pain – gross domestic product contracted 24% in the three months to the end of June – has reduced the appetite for ostentatious spending. Shekhar Bhandari, head of precious metals at Kotak Mahindra Bank, says he expects demand to creep back up once the worst of the pandemic is over. “Have weddings been postponed? The answer is yes,” he says. “Is the number of marriages over the [long term] going to decrease? No.” The pandemic has, however, exposed a longer-term fall in demand for physical gold in the country of 1.4 billion people, with rising financial literacy and access to products like mutual funds prompting many to diversify their holdings away from the metal. Consumer demand has fallen from an average of 900 tonnes a year from 2010 to 2015 to below 700 tonnes last year, according to UBS. Several government schemes in recent years to channel demand into more financially productive assets, such as gold-backed bonds, have failed to stem the decline. China, too, has been hit by a fall in jewellery purchases as a result of coronavirus restrictions and a hesitation to buy gold at high prices. Demand in China hit its lowest level since 2007 in the first half of the year at 152.2 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council. The social and economic disruption of the pandemic risks accelerating the decline of physical gold demand in India and China, undermining a vital consumer base for investors around the world. This year, gold bars have been shipped from Asia to vaults in the US and London via refineries in Switzerland to back the rising demand for gold ETFs. But if western demand slows, those volumes could start to weigh on the market, putting downward pressure on the price, according to Jeremy East, a Hong Kong-based former Standard Chartered banker. “There’s no gold going into China and very little going into India this year,” East adds. “That means the [western] ETF guys need to keep buying, [especially] if at the end of the year China and India are still not buying . . . That gold has got to find a home somewhere. The market needs more money to come in to keep absorbing this gold.” Technology companies in India have sought to bridge the gap between physical and investment demand by offering “digital gold” apps. A variety of services allows consumers to buy and store the metal virtually before taking delivery of coins and bars if they wish to cash out. Amazon launched a digital gold product in August, joining the likes of Lucien’s PhonePe, Google and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which have in recent years launched their own offerings. Varun Sridhar, chief executive of Paytm Money, says these products should help to shore up physical gold demand in India as appetite for purely virtual investments – like ETFs – remains limited. Paytm allows customers to begin buying gold for as little as one rupee. “There’s a lot of emotion and sentiment to that yellow metal,” he adds. “A mutual fund doesn’t give you the satisfaction of wearing it at a party. I believe that over the next couple of decades gold will continue to hold a very important place” for Indian consumers. Yet demand for digital gold, though growing, remains nascent. Paytm says customers “who consider gold buying as a serious saving option” typically hold only between Rs3,120 and Rs5,200 worth of the metal on their platform. Popley, the Mumbai jeweller, expects a generational shift in demand as younger consumers instead opt for diamonds. He is preparing for the trough in demand to continue into next year. “People are not in the mood to buy much jewellery at the moment,” he says. They are “waiting to see what’s going to happen in the next three or four months”. In China, consumers are also turning to new ways to buy, with two new gold ETFs launched in August. But the Chinese gold ETF market is only 3% of the size of the US, with $4 billion in assets. Chinese consumers prefer to buy gold bars that they store at home rather than ETFs, says Xiao Fu, an analyst at Bank of China International. “People in China still think about the traditional channels for buying gold such as jewellery or bars or coins,” she says. “And you can’t expect to make a lot of money in gold [compared with China’s equities market] so the younger generation invest in equities and bitcoin.” Tait says he believes new financial products backed by gold in India and China will grow “exponentially” over the next few years, aligning the markets with the west. That would better link Asia’s gold markets with Europe and the US, he adds. “All quarters of the world gold market will be fully optimised at that point,” says Tait, a former investment banker. “Western institutional and retail as well as eastern institutional and retail [investors] will all come online over the next couple of years.” For now, gold investors are digesting the impact of a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe on the global economy. Instead of gold, many investors have flocked to the relative safety of the dollar. Gold buyers are showing signs of fatigue, according to David Govett, a veteran precious metals trader. But with the upcoming US presidential election and no current end in sight for the pandemic, Buffett’s change of mind on gold may not be a bad bet, Govett says. “Covid-19 cases are on the rise, governments are starting to panic again, economies are facing down the barrel of a second lockdown. All in all, it should be a perfect storm for gold,” he says. “There’s too much uncertainty in the world to short gold.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020 
2020-09-28;Swiss abroad feel let down by vote failures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-abroad-feel-let-down-by-vote-failures/46063372;Two of the five initiative proposals in Sunday’s vote went right down to the wire. Many Swiss people living abroad could not cast their vote because they did not get their documents or had trouble returning them. How would they have voted had they been given the chance? Every vote counted when deciding on reforming the hunting law and on buying new fighter jets – the latter passing by just 8,670 votes out of more than three million cast. This made it all the more annoying for the Swiss Abroad who could not have their say. On Sunday a Swiss person living abroad posed this question on our social media channel: “With such a tight decision, the votes from abroad would have really counted. I declare the vote invalid!” The Organisation of the Swiss Abroad said in a press release that it had received numerous complaints from Swiss nationals living in the European Union who did not get documents two weeks before the polls. It repeated demands for secure electronic voting systems, which it says would finally allow the 780,000 Swiss citizens abroad to fully take part in Swiss referendums and elections. It is estimated that up to 30,000 of the Swiss Abroad did not receive their voting documents or received them too late. But missing documents is not the only obstacle, as our survey shows. swissinfo.ch has received numerous reports of voting forms arriving on time, but that it was impossible or highly expensive to return them because of chaos in the international postal system. The voting documents arrived very early, which motivated me once again to exercise my rights. I got plenty of information beforehand, so the ballot papers were filled out quickly and the Postal Dominicana was only a stone’s throw away,” writes Hans-Jörg Kalt from the Dominican Republic. “My joy was suddenly cut short when I was informed that the Dominican Post was not sending letters to Switzerland due to Covid-19. The embassy confirmed this. When I asked various international companies that still sent mail, the cheapest price was around CHF112 ($120). Thanks, but despite everything it wasn’t worth it for me.” The documents also arrived on time in Serbia, but returning them was also problematic, as Detlef Berg writes: “Of course, it was not possible to send them back for free and waiting in line for hours at the post office was no fun.” Eleonora Meier writes: “Since coronavirus, the postman in the town where I live has disappeared. There is no more mail delivered and if you go to the post office, they tell us nothing has arrived.” The country in which Swiss voters are resident was not the only factor. The performance of different Swiss cantons in the process was also erratic. It is noticeable that the cantons of Zurich and Aargau, for example, did very well. A Swiss citizen in Britain reports: “I have always received documents very early. Usually four to five weeks before the vote. Even now, when we had to reckon with delays, the documents arrived very early. Thumbs up, City of Zurich!” On the other hand, some Swiss Abroad who are registered in canton Bern report that shipping outside of Switzerland is hardly possible. “At the beginning I always received the documents. For several years I have not received any documents from canton Bern, writes Hélène Kern from Germany. But it can often boil down to local post offices, as Christian Felder from Germany confirms: “I find it strange that I got the documents very early in Munich and my son in Berlin [got them] only in the week before the vote.” Both are registered in the same canton. There is a great deal of frustration among many Swiss people abroad. Mario Gisiger writes: “I only received the documents the day before voting. But this is probably because there are currently hardly any flights to the Seychelles. Normally things work just fine.”  And Ruth Soguel-dit-Piquard from New Caledonia writes that she is incredibly frustrated. “For me, the election forms are often only useful for the wastepaper basket or for shopping lists. I have the right to vote, but thanks to the snail-mail I have to forgo my vote.”
2020-09-28;SWISS plans to introduce rapid pre-boarding Covid tests;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-plans-to-introduce-rapid-pre-boarding-covid-tests/46062620;German airline Lufthansa will introduce rapid tests before certain flights to detect Covid-19 in passengers. If the trial, set to start in October, is successful, it will be expanded to Lufthansa subsidiaries Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Edelweiss. The tests are being developed by the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Roche, according to reports in the NZZ am Sonntag and SonntagsZeitung. It is unclear on which flights the tests, which could cost around €10 (CHF10.80) per passenger, will be trialled, the papers said. Lufthansa said it was looking into various price models, such as including a certain amount in the ticket price. The requirement to have a negative Covid-19 test when boarding a plane could allow exemptions from entry bans and compulsory quarantine, the papers wrote. Zurich Airport is also reportedly examining how to integrate such tests into its operations. Since July 6 anyone entering Switzerland from a country or area with an increased risk of infectionExternal link must spend ten days in quarantine and report their arrival to the relevant cantonal authority within two days or face a fine. The economic repercussions of the coronavirus have caused turnover at SWISS to fall by 55% in the first half of 2020. Last month CEO Thomas Klühr warned that the company was still losing a massive amount of money and a return to profitable flights was likely to take time.
2020-09-28;Covid-19: Swiss ‘industry mix’ helps avert dramatic GDP slump;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--swiss--industry-mix--helps-avert-dramatic-gdp-slump/46062512;Government economists say the impact of the pandemic in Switzerland is slightly less severe than previously feared. This is partly thanks to the mix of industries in Switzerland and the decision to rapidly lift coronavirus restrictions, according to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). “In the second quarter of 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) experienced its sharpest decline since the quarterly figures were first calculated in 1980,” SECO said in a statementExternal link on Monday. GDP was down by 7.3% in the second quarter, compared with a forecast of 8.2% in June. But SECO said the authorities’ decision to rapidly end coronavirus lockdown restrictions in June and the economy’s “industry mix” had helped prevent an even more drastic slump in GDP. The chemical and pharmaceutical industries – two of the biggest sectors – increased in value by 0.3% in the second quarter, stabilising the result for the manufacturing industry as a whole (down by 10.3%). But they were not enough to offset heavy losses in other sectors. The hotel and catering sectors, for example, fell by 50.4% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. The arts, entertainment and recreation sector was down by 38.7%. Demand fell across the board. Consumer spending slumped by 8.1% following the closures and strict restrictions put in place to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, investment in equipment and software also contracted sharply by 10%. Figures were revised up for exports of goods (-9.4% to -6.5%) and services (-15.9% to -15.3%). These sectors have been hit by abrupt falls in demand from abroad. The overall economic output this year is now expected to be 5% lower than in 2019, compared with a 6.2% forecast in June. The unemployment rate ( previously expected to be 3.8% by the end of 2020) is now predicted to be 3.5%.
2020-09-27;Swiss votes: immigration, fighter jets, families and hunting;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-votes-in-september--immigration--fighter-jets--families-and-hunting/45983190;" A proposal to scrap an immigration accord with the European Union is one of five issues on the September 27 nationwide ballot in Switzerland. The country’s 5.4 million voters, including registered expatriate Swiss citizens, will also have the final say on a multi-billion financial package to purchase new fighter jets for the Swiss air force, as well as proposals related to family policy and to wildlife and hunting. Immigration has been one of the most recurring and controversial issues in Swiss politics over the past 50 years, notably the free movement of people accord with the EU which came into force in 2002. On September 27, Swiss voters will decide whether that accord should be suspended. Numerous experts and studies have looked at the benefits – or drawbacks – of the labour accord with Switzerland’s most important trading partner. Here's the latest on the immigration vote:   The Swiss armed forces are another source of contention between the political left and the majority centre-right. It’s been barely six years since voters last had their say on the issue; in dealt the political and military establishment a severe blow when they threw out the purchase of new fighter aircraft. Fighter jet pilot Maurice Mattle doesn’t give an opinion on the issue at stake, but he does give a sense of what it’s like to work with the aircraft each day.Here's the latest on the fighter jet vote:  Besides defence and foreign policy, voters will also weigh in on plans to introduce a two-week paternity leave and to grant tax breaks for families with children - two social issues related to families. Why is Switzerland lagging behind other countries in Europe when it comes to giving fathers leave when their child is born? Sociologist Isabel Valarino provides some answers. Tax deductions for families with children are a separate item on the ballot sheet. Will they mainly benefit well-off households, as critics maintain? swissinfo.ch fact checkers give their verdict: Here's the latest on the two votes: Last, but certainly not least is an issue close to the hearts of hunters as well as environmentalists: a proposed reform of the country’s hunting law. At the centre of the debate is the growing wolf population in Swiss mountain regions. Some see the legal amendment as a reasonable compromise to secure the long-term coexistence between the predators and human civilisation. Concerned about Switzerland’s biodiversity, opponents argue the new law encourages the culling of certain wildlife species. The issue of hunting wolves has been controversial for years; a video from our archives explains the controversy. Here's the latest on the hunting law outcome: "
2020-09-25;Swiss clarify what to do for pupil illness in Covid times;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-clarify-what-to-do-for-pupil-illness-in-covid-times/46058674;Switzerland has published new recommendations for children under 12 who are unwell amid confusion about how to react when there are both the coronavirus and regular cold/flu viruses in circulation. “According to the latest findings, while children can get infected with the new coronavirus, those under age 12 are less likely to have symptoms or spread the virus to other people,” the Federal Office of Public Health said on its website on Friday.External link “If possible, children under age 12 should be able to attend school and care facilities. Children in this age group get infected with the new coronavirus less frequently in these settings than in the family.” This means that children with minor cold symptoms, including a light cough or sore throat may go to school or daycare (if health allows and they have not had contact with an adult with Covid-19 symptoms), but not if they have fever or a severe cough. Here special conditions apply, and further clarification may be needed with a doctor, also if other symptoms appear like loss of taste and/or smell (see link).External link But if a child has illness symptoms and has been in direct contact with an adult with Covid-19 symptoms, he or she must stay at home. If this adult tests positive, the child must also be tested, the office said. A positive test for the child means isolation at home under the same conditions as an adult. If the adult’s test is negative, the child must stay at home until he or she has been fever-free for a day or the cough has improved. The regulations come at a time of debate among parents, schools and doctors over whether you can send children to school if they show signs of a cold. Children are especially vulnerable to colds and flu as the weather turns colder. Until now the office had recommended that all people showing symptoms, younger children included, stay at home. “Children present respiratory symptoms more often than adults,” Virginie Masserey, head of infection control at the health office, told the Keystone-SDA news agency. “But with winter viruses coming, we wanted to stop too many absences at school and day care. We have also clarified when to contact children’s doctors because they have been inundated with calls,” she added. At the same time, experts in Switzerland (and globally) have been questioning the role of children in passing on the coronavirus, as cases in schools continue to be reported in the autumn term.   There have been several cases among  pupils in schools across the country over the past weeks. Earlier this month Geneva virologist Isabella Eckerle called for more testing and obligatory mask wearing for younger children at school. Currently primary school pupils are exempt from wearing masks, but older pupils in post-compulsory school do wear then in several cantons.
2020-09-25;Government expects CHF2.5 billion deficit for 2021 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-expects-chf2.5-billion-deficit-for-2021-/46057980;The Swiss government expects a budget deficit of CHF2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) next year, owing to more measures to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Government and parliament have in recent weeks approved additional measures likely to cost Switzerland CHF1.4 billion next year, according to a government press releaseExternal link on Friday. It says that “given the continuing restrictions and the still uncertain outlook, further support measures to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic are planned for 2021”. These include support for public transport (CHF514 million), loss of earnings compensation (CHF490 million) and financial assistance to the cultural sector (CHF130 million), as well as CHF250 million for re-capitalisation of Swiss air traffic controller Skyguide.  Budgeted expenditure for 2021 is now CHF78.3 billion, up 3.9% compared with the 2020 budget, which is due “almost exclusively to Covid-19-related expenditure”.  Despite the expected deficit, the government said “the requirements of the debt brake would be met”.  Swiss voters approved a so-called “debt brake” on federal public finances (which requires federal spending to be linked to revenues in the budget process) in 2001. It was put into operation in 2003. 
2020-09-25;Majority favour wearing masks inside;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/majority-favour-wearing-masks-inside/46057470;Seven out of ten Swiss people would like to see face marks made compulsory for public indoor spaces, according to a survey. But some respondents were sceptical about having a vaccination against Covid-19. The poll, carried out mid-September for Migros-Magazin and published on FridayExternal link, found that 68% of the 1,031 people surveyed were in favour of wearing masks in public closed spaces. However, 67% said they found cantonal differences on the issue confusing. Face masks are mandatory on Swiss public transport, air flights and at Basel and Geneva airports. Nine cantons (Zurich, Vaud, Geneva, Basel City, Valais, Neuchâtel, Fribourg, Solothurn and Jura) have made face masks mandatory in shops. Canton Vaud is the only one to have made them mandatory in all public closed spaces. When it came to being vaccinated against the coronavirus, it was another story. Only 41% said they would get the jab as soon as the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) gave the green light. Scepticism was particularly high among 30- to 45-year-old men, Migros-Magazin reported. Around half of those surveyed thought the federal authorities had done a good job and reacted in the right way to the pandemic. Around 20% thought officials had overreacted. The FOPH has come in for criticism for confusion over its Covid-19 data. Around 28% said they thought democratic rights were at risk. And only one in five felt that the crisis would soon be over. Commenting on the results for Migros-Magazin, Basel sociology professor Oliver Nachtwey said there were some positive signals, like the large acceptance of masks. But scepticism over the vaccine was more concerning. “There is a not-to-be-underestimated part of the population that feels extremely uncertain and distrusts the official explanations of the authorities,” he said. The survey comes as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. A poll conducted for the FOPH published at the end of August found widespread acceptance of masks in public transport and 60% of people in favour of wearing them in shops. Only 33% wanted to wear masks to work.
2020-09-24;Study: no corona infection clusters in canton Zurich schools pre-summer;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/study--no-corona-infection-clusters-in-canton-zurich-schools-pre-summer/46055238;There was no clustering of Covid-19 infections in schools in canton Zurich before the summer break, an antibody study has found. The results come at a time of increasing debate over the role of children in spreading the virus. The University of Zurich (UZH) tested 2,500 children across the canton from mid-June to mid-July 2020 to see if they had previously been infected – and therefore developed antibodies to the coronavirus - during the early onset of the pandemic. On May 11, compulsory schools across the country reopened their doors after an eight-week national lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. The Ciao CoronaExternal link project found several points of interest: first, 2.8% of children tested – or 28 out of 1,000 – displayed antibodies against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, according to the first results released on Thursday. This was about the same percentage as among a randomly selected sample of adults from the same region in July 2020. Second, symptoms were not very specific: some fever or coughing, or an upset stomach. This made it harder to find the infected children. “Over the period examined, 73% of the schoolchildren exhibited possible Covid-19 symptoms, but children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 presented such symptoms just as frequently as those who tested positive,” said study leader and university epidemiologist Susi Kriemler in a statement. There was no clustering of cases within schools and classes. Out of 100 classes, 67 had no single infection, 29 had one case, three had two cases and one had three cases. These findings, the statement said, support the current hypothesis that children rarely get infected at school and are likelier to contract the virus in other settings, such as the family. However, the authors also advised caution in interpreting the results. “Due to the lockdown, the children physically attended school for only a relatively brief two-month period between the onset of the novel coronavirus and the first stage of testing. During this acute phase, they were arguably more likely exposed to the virus in the family setting. We have to wait for the next testing stages before we can make reliable statements,” said Milo Puhan, director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention InstituteExternal link of UZH and the initiator of the study, in the statement. The study also found that younger children, aged 6-9, were infected just as often, or even a little bit more, as older ones, “contrary to prevailing current opinion”. The authors explained this by the closer physical contact with their parents and other adult relatives. Further Ciao Corona testing of pupils will take place in autumn this year and spring 2021 (parents and school staff spring only). This, researchers hope, will help them understand whether and how the coronavirus is spreading within schools and families, and also what kind of symptoms children have. The study, part of nationwide immunity research programme, is also looking at whether measures in schools – masks are not required for pupils in primary schools but there is a strict hygiene concept – are effective and whether post-infection protection against re-infection exists. Participation, which involves giving blood or saliva samples and answering health questionnaires, is voluntary. Experts in Switzerland (and globally) have been questioning the role of children in passing on the virus, as cases in schools continue to be reported in the autumn term. Parents have also said they are in a dilemma about what to do if their children display cold symptoms, very common among during these months. Currently the Swiss authorities do not consider the under-12s to be drivers of the pandemic and they are not routinely tested. Earlier this month, Geneva virologist Isabella Eckerle called for more testing and obligatory mask wearing for younger children at school
2020-09-24;Pause and play: the Swiss film industry through the pandemic ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pause-and-play--the-swiss-film-industry-through-the-pandemic-/45878492;"International sets, large crowds and crews, intimate shots: filmmaking doesn’t naturally lend itself to social distancing, meaning the coronavirus is disrupting films worldwide. This is how Swiss directors and the industry have been coping with the situation. Romed Wyder was working as a director on a Swiss-Luxembourg co-production when the Swiss government announced the lockdown in March, effectively suspending international travel. “We didn’t know what was going to happen,” he said. “We had to make a decision. We stopped everything and postponed to late summer.” Cast and crew of his feature film Une histoire provisoire (A temporary story) are from both countries. The primary indoor location was in Luxembourg. “We’d just finished installing the décor for our interior shots, where filming was supposed to start a week later,” Wyder said. “We could only have that apartment until the beginning of September, so we definitely had to come back before that.” His is one of several productions that came to a halt amid the pandemic. The break put a strain on budgets and left the jobs and creative output of people in the country’s creative industry at risk. The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), swissinfo.ch's parent company, normally puts CHF32.5 million ($35.7 million) into the film industry every year. It has had to postpone or put on hold the production of several TV-series, documentaries and co-productions. Production companies rescheduled their film premieres as cinemas closed. The Locarno Film Festival, like many similar events, was cancelled in its traditional form because of the outbreak. Organisers decided to introduce a new award category. Twenty projects that were put on hold because of the coronavirus – ten Swiss, ten international – competed in the “The films after tomorrow”External link section. Five winners were awarded prize money ranging from CHF30,000 to CHF100,000 to help the film crews complete their work. Disassembling and storing set decoration added extra costs to Wyder’s bills. So did the longer equipment rental, the salaries he had to pay during the unexpected break and the extended shoot. Adding days to the schedule isn’t the only cause for an unplanned budget rise. According to the guidelinesExternal link issued by the Association of Swiss Producers, production companies have to equip sets with washing facilities, disinfection and protective material and provide additional cleaning staff. Workers have to travel in smaller groups or individually. “We had to reorganise the circulation of people on set to keep the necessary distance and comply with the maximum amount of people in the same room,” Wyder said. “This can add roughly one hour to the normal daily routine”. The guidelines also recommend appointing a chief health officer, who ensures the rules are followed. This person “must be present at all times and must not be constrained by other duties”, according to the guidelines. That often means that an additional person has to be hired at short notice, no small feat for limited production budgets. “Ideally, we’d look for an additional stage manager, someone who also has some basic medical knowledge,” said Elena Tatti, a producer at the Swiss production company Box Productions. The shoot of their upcoming feature also had to be postponed from mid-July to the beginning of September.     Amid the uncertainties, some still managed to pursue their shoot, with the necessary precautions, like Swiss director Laura Kaehr, currently filming Becoming Giulia. Everyone wore masks and medical gloves during the first critical weeks of the pandemic, she said. “I’m making a documentary, so the situation is a bit different. The actors are part of a real-life family. They share a house. No strict social distancing is required among them,” said Kaehr. “Luckily my protagonists live on the ground floor, so at the beginning we were able to continue working with the crew staying outside in the garden, placing the microphone near the window,” she recalled. Do restrictions mean there won’t be any films showing close contact between actors? “There has to be,” said Swiss producer and director Alberto Meroni. “It’s up to us to understand, with intelligence and foresight, how to do this.” During the pandemic, he shot only a couple of TV adverts, an experience that influenced his decision to delay filming on other projects.  “In these short ads there were only a couple of actors, part of the same family, the crew wore masks, and we shot outside,” said Meroni. “These measures wouldn’t have been applicable, for example, to the feature film we had planned, because it takes place in a high school, with lots of kids, in an enclosed space”.    Imposing a quarantine on cast and crew isn’t always feasible, but it could be an option to avoid further delays, if the setting of the shoot allows it. “Until we get a vaccine, actors have to play along and isolate themselves prior to coming on set,” said Meroni. Besides intimate shots, the pandemic also raises questions about casting. Industry guidelines state that people considered as vulnerable, according to the Federal Office of Public Health, shouldn’t be hired, effectively excluding people aged 65 or above, among others. This caused the indefinite delay of director Felix Tissi’s upcoming feature Aller Tage Abend (As time goes by), which he describes as a “whimsical tale about old age.” The shoot was stopped mid-March and will probably not resume before the end of the year. But these are not the only concerns. The cancellation of film festivals and premieres around the world affected the visibility of these projects, while the unplanned pause has left many in the industry worrying about an oversupply of films when life returns to some kind of normality after the pandemic. As many professionals are self-employed and work on several projects per year, the postponements have jeopardised projects due to start this autumn. Producers might have to compete to woo the best technicians for their productions.  Overall, directors and producers say that actors are taking their responsibilities seriously and that they trust each other. “Actors know what it means not to be working; they don’t want to risk that,” says Romed Wyder. “We have absolutely no interest in someone getting ill, so we’ll do all it takes to prevent that and the general delay it could cause.” Wyder is one of the lucky ones: shooting for his feature film has restarted, both in Luxembourg and Geneva.  "
2020-09-24;Swiss president blasts UN member states for ‘blocking’ decisions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-president-blasts-un-member-states-for--blocking--decisions/46054480;Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency, has criticised United Nations member states for “standing in the way” of the global body’s work, in her video speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday. She took a swipe at members – without naming any specific countries – that “block decisions or refuse to implement them, undermine resolutions or flout their principles”. “This weakens the UN and it weakens all of us, too,” she told the assembly in her video presentationExternal link. She urged states to assume their responsibilities. “If we want a strong UN, then we – member states – must strongly support the organisation and work together to pursue its objectives. Because the goals of the UN are our goals.” This year’s event, which marks the 75th anniversary of the UN, is taking place via video link, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. After years of hesitation, Switzerland finally joined the UN in 2002 after a close public vote. Since becoming the 190th UN member, Swiss attitudes towards membership and other UN-related issues have been largely positive. “My country is proud to contribute to the achievement of the UN's goals, even if it is not always easy.” She added that it is difficult to translate the goals Switzerland has set itself – on climate or gender equality for example – into national policy. “My country is prepared to take on more responsibilities, which is why for the first time, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2023–2024.” Sommaruga also underlined the role of Geneva in promoting peace and in the field of international security. She also highlighted that the western Swiss city is the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO). World leaders convened electronically on September 22 for the six-day virtual General Assembly, which is unique in the UN’s 75-year history. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the first virtual “general debate” exhorting member states to unite and tackle the era’s towering problems: the coronavirus, the “economic calamity” it unleashed and the risk of a new Cold War between the United States and China. Political differences and anger were evident in various speeches. China and Iran clashed with the US— via pre-recorded videos from home — and leaders expressed frustration and anger at the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which the UN chief has called “the number one global security threat in our world today”.
2020-09-23;Over 2,000 students at Swiss hotel school placed in quarantine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/over-2-000-students-at-swiss-hospitality-school-in-quarantine/46053534;All undergraduate students at the École hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) - one of the most prestigious hospitality management schools in the world - have been placed in quarantine after several coronavirus outbreaks. Until September 28, around 2,500 bachelor students – some three-quarters of all of the students at the hospitality school – will be required to stay in isolation. The decision was taken in cooperation with health authorities in canton Vaud. Significant outbreaks of infection have appeared in several levels of training making it impossible to have a more targeted closure than the 2,500 students concerned, explained the Vaud authorities. Based on reports from Swiss public television, RTS, coronavirus outbreaks at the school in recent days are the result of parties and activities, some of which  took place before the canton tightened restrictions on September 15 amid rising infections. When asked if the canton should not have introduced the measures earlier, cantonal doctor Karim Boubaker told RTSExternal link that the authorities had been sufficiently clear about the risks involved, which had not been heeded. Now we have to take exceptional measures, and this is something that I regret. It didn't need to come to this, he said in the interview. Students would be able to continue with their work by following distance classes, added Boubaker. Vaud has one of the highest number of casesExternal link of any canton with 213 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days. On September 15, the canton closed nightclubs and banned private events of more than 100 people. Masks are also mandatory in all public spaces inside. The students are expected to stay in isolation until September 28, while classes continue online. “We take all the necessary measures for the continuity of teaching and to strengthen health measures on the campus,” said the school management.  The Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL) opened in 1893, making it the first hospitality management school in the world. Since then Switzerland has become a hospitality training hub, with around 25 training schools in operation. In 2020, EHL was chosen as the best school in the world for Hospitality and Leisure Management studies in the QS university rankings.
2020-09-23;Parliament clarifies federal government powers to manage Covid-19 crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parliament-clarifies-federal-government-powers-to-manage-covid-19-crisis/46053398;Measures put in place by the federal government to help manage the coronavirus crisis can be officially extended thanks to a decision by parliament. On March 13, the federal government assumed some executive powers that allowed it to enact certain laws and measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. With the unanimous decision on Wednesday, parliament assured that the measures don’t expire six months later. The measures can now be extended until the end of 2021. This concerns above all financial support for workers and companies suffering as a result of coronavirus restrictions. Businesses hard hit by the pandemic restrictions, particularly in the events, tourism and travel sectors, can receive financial support but only if cantons apply and contribute half of the funding. The self-employed and employers will also receive support to cover loss of earnings. Parliament also agreed that professional football and ice hockey leagues will be able to take out interest-free loans. An additional CHF20 million ($22 million) was also earmarked for cultural activities, bringing the total sum for the Federal Office of Culture to CHF100 million.   The situation at Swiss borders was also clarified, specifically that people with special ties to a border region will be able to continue to travel there in the case that new restrictions are put in place. The federal government has been given more extensive powers in healthcare, specifically in approving vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. Parliament didn’t go as far as to allow the federal government to make vaccines mandatory.
2020-09-23;Students step up pressure over international exchanges;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/students-step-up-pressure-over-international-exchanges/46049832;Student organisations have handed in a petition with more than 10,000 signatures calling on the government to start immediate negotiations to rejoin Erasmus+, the European Union’s student exchange scheme. Without proper participation, they argue, international cooperation in education risks being endangered in the long term. Following a 2014 Swiss vote which targeted EU immigration, negotiations on Swiss participation in Erasmus+ were suspended (the country had been part of the previous programme). An interim arrangement was put in place: the Swiss-European Mobility Programme (SEMP). This made Switzerland a partner country of Erasmus+ but offered students more limited opportunities than full membership would. This workaround is expected to remain in place until 2021. Francesco Bee, co-head of the Swiss Student Union,External link said handing in the petition in Bern was an “important step”.  “Participation would have been, in principle, possible again since 2016. But the government is dragging its feet, although parliament has already given the government a clear mandate to start negotiations with the EU. It’s about time that Switzerland finally started negotiations for full membership of the Erasmus+ successor programme for 2021-2027,” he told swissinfo.ch via email. The petition, which was formally handed in to the Federal Chancellery on Wednesday morning, has the support of a number of student organisations, plus some parliamentarians. A socially distanced event was held on the square outside parliament to mark the step. The petition’s supporters argue that the government should foster good relations with the EU to participate in the successor scheme and that education and mobility – and sufficient funding to take part – must be made a priority. They say that the current Swiss solution is insufficient: it focuses more on students and offers fewer opportunities to those in vocational education than the original scheme. Furthermore, because each contract needs to be concluded individually, it is difficult for Swiss higher education institutions to find partner institutions abroad. Some overseas universities – like Cambridge – no longer conclude any exchange agreements with Swiss universities. Others have greatly reduced their quotas for Swiss students. The government has said it is closely following the ongoing discussions in the EU about the Erasmus+ follow-up programme and would consider the question of association, “carefully taking into account the costs and benefits involved”. On Tuesday the minister in charge of education, Guy Parmelin, said that “all the financial elements were not yet in place” for Erasmus+. He has previously mooted autumn as a timetable for looking into the issue. This would make it too late for Swiss students to join any successor scheme from early 2021. Swissuniversities, the umbrella organisation, has also voiced its discontentExternal link over the interim solution. Another factor: increased red tapeExternal link when bringing in foreign students, it says. Education issues continue to be a source of debate. On Tuesday the Senate approved an update to the law on international exchange and mobility in education, which calls for more of a focus outside the EU. It has already become clear with the new semester that current student exchanges, both for Swiss students going abroad and foreign students coming to Switzerland, have been greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
2020-09-23;Nurses around the world take to the streets;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/conditions-de-travail-du-personnel-soignant_nurses-around-the-world-take-to-the-streets/46049858;"After giving their all for months to cushion the blow of Covid-19, nurses around the world are demanding better working conditions. Demonstrations are also planned in Switzerland, where parliament is balking at taking steps to improve the long-term situation for nursing staff. In the United States, New Zealand, France, Peru and Zimbabwe, nurses are downing tools to demand better working conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the spotlight on the difficult daily lives of careworkers, who are often understaffed, poorly paid and little recognised. The extreme situation lived by nurses in recent months has given new impetus to demands that have been on the table for decades. In Switzerland, too, the movement is gaining momentum: associations and trade unions have joined forces to set up an alliance of healthcare professions. A week of protests is scheduled for the end of October, followed by a demonstration in front of the federal parliament in Bern on October 31. Parliament is currently debating the popular initiative “For strong nursing care”, which was submitted by the Swiss Nurses’ Association in 2017. The government is calling on voters to reject this text, but it is putting forward an indirect counterproposal, which aims to achieve some of the goals of the initiative: to promote training and give more responsibilities to nursing professionals. Parliament’s two chambers are hammering out the details of the counterproposal, in particular regarding the obligation for cantons to provide financial assistance to young people in education and reimbursement by the basic health insurance of services provided independently by nurses. However, the Swiss Nurses’ Association regrets that parliament’s draft does not include measures to ensure that staffing keeps pace with needs and to improve working conditions, at a time when 46% of nurses abandon the profession, according to a study by the Swiss Health Observatory – the highest rate among professionals in the health sector. While many Swiss statistics are encouraging when compared internationally – for instance, the country has one of the highest per-capita ratios of nurses and new graduates – there are some worrying indicators. According to the latest Health at a Glance report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), published in 2019, nurses’ pay when compared with the average Swiss salary is among the lowest in the OECD. Switzerland also ranks second among the countries that rely most on nurses trained abroad, with a proportion of 25%. In addition, according to figures from the Federal Statistical Office, 36% of hospital careworkers are not Swiss: 13% are German, 12% French and 3% Italian. This dependence on foreign professionals, in particular cross-border workers, came to the fore during the pandemic. When states closed their borders to limit the spread of Covid-19, Switzerland had to negotiate with its neighbours to allow the continued movement of health personnel so that its hospitals could keep working properly. This situation persists with the new wave of infections and quarantine imposed on anyone entering Switzerland from a region at risk. The government has put certain French departments on its red list, while clearly stating that exceptions will be made for border areas. An international study carried out in 2012 shows that Swiss nurses are on the whole satisfied with their working environment compared with other European countries; they also suffer less from mental fatigue. But according to an survey conducted among Swiss careworkers by the trade union Unia at the end of 2019, 90% of respondents felt that they were working under pressure and 87% considered that they did not have enough time to devote to their patients. A majority said that they had to work double shifts without the requisite rest breaks and that they didn’t have enough time to dedicate to their families and leisure activities. Meanwhile, personal accounts gathered during swissinfo.ch’s inquiry into the daily lives of nurses in Switzerland confirm that they are stressed, overworked and pinched for time to spend with their patients. Those interviewed also complained about pressure from their superiors and a lack of regard for nursing staff. “To ensure good nursing care in the future, we need to have enough staff and good framework conditions,” stresses Sophie Ley, president of the Swiss Nurses’ Association. “A training campaign will not suffice if nearly half of them then quit the profession.”"
2020-09-23;Rapid Covid-19 tests could offer a path back to normal;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/rapid-covid-19-tests-could-offer-a-path-back-to-normal/46051206;Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche plans to launch a test that can detect the coronavirus in 15 minutes. Could tests like this become the norm? With no vaccine in sight for at least a few months, testing is becoming a more important part of containing the coronavirus. Antigen tests, which detect the presence of a specific viral antigen such as proteins, promise to dramatically reduce the cost and time to receive results, allowing people to go about their business. But rapid antigen tests aren’t as sensitive as the gold standard RT-PCR technology (Polymerase Chain Reaction) that has been widely used until now. With the Roche antigen test, there’s a less than 0.5% change of a false positive, but a 3.48% of a false negative, which means it won’t catch every person infected. As more countries stock up on rapid antigen tests, some of which are as quick and easy to use as a pregnancy test, how worried should we be if they miss some infections? Not too worried according to some experts. While the tests still need to be validated by health authorities, they could provide a new way to manage the crisis and avoid costly quarantines by focusing on people who are most likely to spread the virus. Virologist Isabella Eckerle who is the Head of the Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases at the University of Geneva toldExternal link the German-language newspaper NZZ am Sonntag a few weeks ago that rapid tests are a promising alternative.  Although they are less sensitive, “rapid tests identify infected people who have a high viral load and are currently contagious. When I'm at the end of my illness and only have a small amount of virus left, the rapid test may come back negative, but I'm no longer contagious anyway”. Tim Pfister, CEO at ender diagnostics, agrees with Eckerle and says its time to shift toward what he calls “intelligent testing systems”. Rather than catch everyone infected, Pfister told swissinfo.ch, testing should look for infectious carriers of the virus with tests that are designed especially for that purpose. This helps identify super-spreaders, some of whom may not have any symptoms. “Not everyone who has the virus can transmit it. This is because in order to transmit the virus, you need a certain viral load. And a higher viral load requires less sensitivity to be detected by a test.” A few months ago, ender diagnostics received the CE mark for its first rapid Covid-19 diagnostics test, which uses a similar technology to PCR called isothermal technology. It recently signed a partnership with SWISS international airlines to test long-haul cabin crew flying to destinations where a coronavirus test is required. It’s now in discussions with other airlines, cruise and resort operators and open-air festival operators. According to the World Health Organization, Roche is one of nearly a hundred companies developing or manufacturing rapid Covid-19 antigen tests. Some experts worry that a strategy based on antigen tests will miss infectious people and result in outbreaks in countries that have largely curbed coronavirus transmission. They argue that it’s still unclear what viral load is the threshold below which a person is no longer contagious. “The question is, what is the safe limit? Because the moment you get that wrong, the whole idea implodes,” Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands told NatureExternal link magazine earlier this month. Roche added that because antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR, there is a hypothesis that they identify people who are more infectious, but this has not been fully proven This means that an antigen test might give a negative result for someone with a low viral load but that person could still be infectious. Currently, there are no truly quantitative tests for Covid-19, said a Roche spokesperson. “The reason is simple. No universally accepted standard for SARS-COV-2 viral load exists.” Efforts led by the WHO to create such a standard are underway but “we are not there yet”. In a guidance noteExternal link released on September 11, the WHO stated that antigen tests are most likely to perform well in patients with high viral loads but that more evidence is needed. In hospital settings, experts still encourage the use of PCR tests. In contrast to many other countries, Switzerland hasn’t been pushing for a massive uptake in rapid testing. The Swiss public health authorities still only recommend people with symptoms get tested. The NZZ am Sonntag reported over the weekend that health authorities are concerned about delivery bottlenecks if there is a major increase in testing. Last week, some 12,000 tests were carried out a day in Switzerland. There is reportedly enough capacity for 20,000 tests per day. The government is facing more demands to boost testing, especially from the travel industryExternal link. SWISS have called for testing centres at major Swiss airports instead of quarantines that are currently required for anyone coming from a high-risk area. Several countries including Germany and France require some travelers to be tested for Covid-19 prior to entry. Last month, the United States announced it was spending $760 million to ramp up production of rapid antigen tests, which have also become a key element in the testing strategies of other countries, such as India and Italy.
2020-09-22;How do you build trust in new technologies?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-do-you-build-trust-in-new-technologies-/46043084;The coronavirus pandemic and controversy over the SwissCovid contact tracing app have highlighted the importance of boosting user confidence in new technologies. The “Swiss Digital Trust Label” is one solution aiming to ease this process. In the digital age, the notion of ‘trust’ dominates the technological debate as never before. To be successful and effective, new technologies must be able to instil consumer confidence. Not only does consumption depend on this, but also the actual impact that technology has on society. This issue inevitably influences the way that cutting-edge products and services are designed and developed. But the coronavirus pandemic has opened the Pandora’s box of the eternal conflict between ethics and innovation, placing civil society firmly at the heart of the debate. So trust stops being the consequence and becomes the prerequisite of innovation. This leads to deeper reflection on the ethics and reliability of emerging technologies, two now indissoluble and essential concepts, especially in the world of artificial intelligence and digital solutions. It raises key questions: How can one innovate while integrating ethical principles from the early stages of a new project? What criteria and rules should be adopted to protect the user, without hampering the innovative process? The fear that having ‘too many rules’ will hinder the digital transformation of society and make it difficult to innovate is the subject of debate in the academic and business worlds. Already in 2014, the European Commission published a study on the complex and ambiguous relationship between regulation and innovation. According to Jean-Daniel Strub, co-founder of ethix, the Swiss laboratory for ethical innovation supported by the Migros Engagement Fund, ethical considerations do not impinge on innovation, but rather help spur the development of more sustainable technologies, by confronting the main players with the risks of irresponsible progress in terms of their reputation, legality and the impact on civil society. “Companies today cannot fail to approach innovation from an ethical perspective and make early investments in this respect. Being aware of the notion of ‘ethical risks’ is crucial in order to keep pace with a constantly evolving society,” says Strub. While a pragmatic assessment of the risks posed by technological advances that contradict the values of democratic and liberal societies is forcing small, medium and large enterprises, at least in the West, to address the issue of ethics, the biggest challenge nonetheless remains: turning the debate into concrete actions that will give the system a positive shock. With this in mind, the Swiss Digital Initiative – which was presented at the first Swiss Global Digital Summit in September 2019 – launched its first project, the Swiss Digital Trust Label, at the end of last year. Its aim is to promote the responsible use of new technologies through a multi-faceted and pragmatic approach. According to the Swiss Digital Initiative’s director, Niniane Paeffgen, the idea is to give users more information on digital services, thereby creating transparency and ensuring respect for ethical values. “At the same time, we want to help guarantee that ethical and responsible behaviour also becomes a competitive advantage for businesses. This label seeks to balance the asymmetry of information and power that exists today between people and the economy,” Paeffgen explains. Similar initiatives have already emerged at the international level. In Switzerland, the project was initiated by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), and is being carried out thanks to collaboration by an interdisciplinary group of experts from the EPFL, the federal technology institute ETH Zurich, the universities of Geneva and Zurich and different players from the world of industry, who are all members of the digitalswitzerland network. While the existence of a label could certainly encourage companies to adopt responsible behaviour, in order not to be cut out of the market, questions remain about how to ensure that the initiative does not turn into a business. “The Swiss Digital Initiative is a non-profit organisation. Our mission is to create high-quality content and to give international players the possibility of taking it on to the next level,” Paeffgen explains.   The label is currently in the development stage. A public consultation was recently initiated in order to stimulate an open debate in preparation for the launch of the label, scheduled for spring/summer 2021. However, some non-minor issues have still not been resolved, such as the cost of obtaining the label, reinvestment of the profits, and how to guarantee objectivity and transparency in awarding it. According to the Swiss Digital Initiative, compliance with the criteria will be certified by an external and independent verification body, such as SGS Société Générale de Surveillance (General Society of Surveillance), a Swiss multinational headquartered in Geneva that provides inspection and certification services. So does this mean that we can trust the label? Professor Effy Vayena, director of the Health Ethics and Policy Lab at ETH Zurich, welcomes the initiative, but stresses the importance of establishing the right criteria for it to be effective. “When selecting the criteria, pragmatism and feasibility are key. Initiatives of this kind can work very well or very badly, depending on the approach chosen,” says Vayena. Another point to consider is the still widespread distrust among those sceptical of the ‘label business’, accompanied by the fear of rising costs for consumers. “On the other hand, what’s the alternative?” questions Christoph Heitz, president of the Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services, who is leading a project to draw up a code of ethics for data-based activities. In Heitz’s view, the basic merit of labels is to generate positive dynamics within society, without necessarily having to resort to legal obligations. “Labels cannot replace laws, but at the same time legislation cannot address all the problems. I think the good thing is that these initiatives raise awareness and set standards,” says Heitz. However, it is still difficult to conceive that, in an uncertain or even non-existent regulatory framework, ethical initiatives can mark a real turning point for society. How would it be, then, if good ideas went hand in hand with good laws?
2020-09-21;Covid-19: Swiss increasingly wary about museums and shows;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19--swiss-increasingly-wary-about-museums-and-shows/46047684;"Around one in three Swiss say they will not go to the cinema or a museum until the Covid-19 pandemic is completely over. The population has become “more reticent” about attending cultural activities since June, a pollExternal link commissioned by the Federal Office of Culture found. At the end of August 42% of the 1,000 people who took part in the survey said they would only start going to culture-related events or activities in 2021; in June this figure stood at 22%. The percentage varies according to the activity: around 43% said they were not prepared to attend a concert or a show at a theatre, opera or circus. Meanwhile, 36% said they would not go to a museum or exhibition, and 64% said they would avoid festivals.  The cultural sector in Switzerland has struggled amid the pandemic. The government approved a financial package worth CHF280 million ($306 million) to help businesses and institutions cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland. Yet around 65% of those questioned in the new survey felt the cultural sector should receive extra financial support. Meanwhile, the number of new positive cases continues to creep up, with an average case count of 65 per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks. The daily number of new infections across the country, based on a seven-day average, stands at 422. This represents a 14% rise on the previous week. Vaud, Zurich, Geneva, Fribourg, Bern and Aargau are the worst-affected cantons."
2020-09-18;Swiss, Austrian leaders hail ‘crisis-proof cooperation’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--austrian-leaders-hail--crisis-proof-cooperation-/46043690;"Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga has praised the strong cooperation between Switzerland and neighbour Austria over these past coronavirus-hit months and has pressed for good relations to continue. She was speaking following talks with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is on a visit to Switzerland. Austria is one of Switzerland’s main trading partners and its borders with Switzerland have been a focus during the coronavirus pandemic. Kurz was received with military honours - with masks and social distancing - at the Lohn Estate near the Swiss capital Bern, which is the official estate of the Swiss confederation. Also present were cabinet members Ueli Maurer, Alain Berset, Karin Keller-Sutter and Ignazio Cassis. “Cooperation with Austria has proved itself to be crisis-proof,” Sommaruga said. “This makes me optimistic for the coming months as we will also have to operate in crisis mode, but also for further in the future.” Kurz said that he wanted to intensify this cooperation. “We want to ensure, together, that our linked border regions can keep on working together as well as before and that there are no border closures,” he said. Covid-19 infections have been increasing in Austria since late June, as they have in Switzerland and in other European countries. More recently the Vienna government has mainly blamed the rise on people returning from tourism hotspots such as Spain and Croatia. Vienna is a particular hotspot and is on Switzerland’s high-risk list. In response to a journalist’s question about the ski season, Kurz said that winter tourism should take place, but that there would be restrictions placed on Après Ski and evenings out. A concept on this would shortly be published, he said. For her part, Sommaruga said that Switzerland was currently still considering the issue. Neighbouring Austria is one of Switzerland’s main trading partners, with trade and services worth €20 billion (CHF22 billion) between the two countries. Switzerland is also one of the most important investors in Austria. Swiss firms employ 34,000 people in their neighbour. Diplomatic visits between the neighbours are common; Sommaruga last visited the Austrian capital, Vienna, at the end of January."
2020-09-17;Paternity leave: ‘Nobody is talking about the indirect costs’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-nobody-is-talking-about-the-indirect-costs-/46041008;Switzerland doesn’t need two weeks of paternity leave, says Radical-Liberal politician Yasmine Bourgeois. The mother of three says if the proposal is accepted on September 27, left-wing groups will keep asking for more and more. As a mother who is not only against paternity leave but who is a member of the opposition committee, Yasmine Bourgeois is something of an outlier in the current campaign. And she has met with some hostility because of it. While her personal circle backs her, the Zurich politician says she is seeing some “pretty heated comments” on social media. Within her centre-right Radical-Liberal Party, meanwhile, debate on the issue has gradually faded. But only after it proved to be a strong bone of contention. Although most female members were in favour of the two-week paternity leave proposal, the party ultimately decided – by a slim majority – to support a “no” vote on September 27. Bourgeois, a member of Zurich’s city parliament, is against leave for fathers not out of loyalty to the party, but from conviction. “In my view, introducing an additional paternity leave [on top of existing maternity leave] has no added value,” she says. She maintains that fathers-to-be already have the option of planning holidays ahead of time, since the birth of a child doesn’t generally come out of the blue. Moreover, “most fathers should find it worth their while to do so,  she says. On the right, the Radical-Liberals weren’t the only ones to be divided by the issue. The People’s Party, the biggest group in parliament, is also backing a “no”. But some of its female members are dissenting, including the high-ranking Céline Amaudruz, the party’s vice-president, who has come out in favour. As so often happens with social and political issues, there is a clear rift between the German-speaking and Latin (i.e. French- and Italian-speaking) parts of Switzerland. For her part, Bourgeois doesn’t want to see paternity leave raised up as some general yardstick for measuring equality. “People say we are clinging to an outdated model. But the opposite is true: paternity leave cements the image of a conservative family. A model where fathers slip back into their old routine after two weeks of paternity leave is outdated. Today, every family can decide for themselves who works how much and who takes on what amount of childcare.” Bourgeois is also a strong supporter of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). She believes they will lose out if the left-wing proposal is accepted. “It’s simply the wrong moment,” she says. “Our social services are in bad shape, many are already struggling because of the coronavirus.” While larger companies might be able to cope with the additional expenses, she’s convinced that paternity leave would pose serious problems for businesses at the smaller end of the scale. Even now, employees and employers can work together to find a solution that suits everyone, she says. “It’s in every employer’s interest to ensure that workers are happy.” With her husband running his own business and dealing with such matters on a daily basis, Bourgeois has seen such problems first-hand. If an employee is absent in a small company, it’s sorely felt. “There has been a lot of debate about covering the direct costs of paternity leave, but nobody is talking about the indirect costs,” she says. For 16 years, Bourgeois has been working 50% as a primary school teacher in Zurich. Her seat in the city parliament, meanwhile, is her first political mandate apart from representing the Radical-Liberals on the local education board. Her husband is also politically active, as a member of the cantonal parliament for the same party. At home, the division of tasks works well and is fairly equitable, Bourgeois says. Her husband also pitched in when the children were born. “Off his own bat,” she emphasises. “Being self-employed, it wasn’t easy for him to take time off. There are things that just don’t get done, and you have to weigh up how important they are. But that’s the way it is. When you have children, you have to go without certain things.” She is convinced that there are already enough ways for parents to organise themselves so they can get back to work. With childcare and help from grandparents, most needs can be covered, she says. Switzerland is one of the few countries within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that hasn’t introduced paternity leave. But Bourgeois doesn't see this as a problem. “We have other privileges instead,” she says. Her fear is that “once paternity leave is here, it will be expanded and expanded.” In Spain, she says, what began as two weeks of paternity leave will reach 16 by next year. In canton Zurich, meanwhile, the Social Democrats have already submitted a proposal for 18 weeks’ joint parental leave. Translated and adapted from German by Julia Bassam & Domhnall O'Sullivan
2020-09-17;Most Swiss want insurance to cover Covid-19 vaccination;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/most-swiss-want-insurance-to-cover-covid-19-vaccination/46040428;A survey has revealed Swiss public opinion on vaccination and whether to punish those who don’t comply with coronavirus pandemic measures. Among those surveyed, 49.2% said that a Covid-19 vaccine should be covered by basic health insurance for anyone who wants to be inoculated. Another 17.4% said the vaccine should be covered and mandatory for everyone, while 17.9% said it should only be covered for those in risk groups – as is the case with flu jabs. The representative survey was conducted by internet comparison service Comparis, which questioned over 1,000 respondents from around Switzerland. Nearly 20% of those under 56 said everyone should be vaccinated, compared with 11.9% of 56- to 74-year-olds. The proportion of those in favour of compulsory vaccination was particularly high in French-speaking Switzerland – with 23.2% in all age groups, compared with 15.1% among German-speaking Swiss – and also among people with a high level of education. Nearly three-quarters want there to be fines for not complying with the quarantine obligation and for giving false personal details in restaurants or clubs (73.4%) and for not disclosing contact details after a positive coronavirus test (68.7%). A majority of respondents (66.7%) said that failure to comply with the obligation to wear masks in prescribed places should be punished. However, 67.9% said they didn’t want fines for breaking the distance rules. This was particularly true for those under 35. There was disagreement among respondents about renewed border closures should an entire neighbouring country be added to the list of quarantine risk countries. Half of those surveyed said temporary border closures for private individuals would make sense. The proportion of those in favour of closing the border was higher in rural areas (51.7%) than among city dwellers (40%). 
2020-09-16;UNRWA boss warns of financial crisis impacting services;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/unrwa-boss-warns-of-financial-crisis-impacting-services/46038448;The ongoing financial crisis at the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) could force it to halt certain services for the already poverty-stricken population of over five million people, its boss Philippe Lazzarini has warned. The Swiss humanitarian expert, who took over UNRWA in March, told the Associated Press news agency on Wednesday that the spread of coronavirus, an economic meltdown in Lebanon and a huge deficit in UNRWA’s budget were making the situation increasingly desperate for Palestinian refugees, some of whom are trying to flee the Mediterranean nation on migrant boats. UNRWA was established to aid the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes, as well as their descendants. It provides basic needs and services to 5.5 million refugees and families in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Since the United States, its largest donor, cut off funding in 2018, UNRWA has been under significant financial strain. Washington gave $360 million (CHF327 million) to the agency in 2017, but only $60 million in 2018 and nothing in 2019 or so far this year. Lazzarini said UNRWA is facing an estimated shortfall of about $200 million between now and the end of 2020 if the agency wants to maintain all the services in its five fields of operations, including schools, health centres and social welfare. The organisation’s situation has been made worse by the financial difficulties most donor countries are grappling with. Lazzarini on Wednesday discussed the plight of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon with President Michel Aoun and outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Aoun called for the return of Palestinians who fled to Lebanon in recent years from Syria’s civil war. The Swiss said he met Palestinians in refugee camps during his visit to Lebanon who spoke about their hardships amid the country's worst economic and financial crisis in decades. “There is a really deep sense of hopelessness and despair today in the Palestinian camps,” he declared. The former United Nations humanitarian chief for Lebanon, took over the reins of UNRWA from another Swiss humanitarian expert - Pierre Krähenbühl - who resigned in November 2019 after accusations of mismanagement.
2020-09-16;Julius Bär in talks with US authorities to resolve FIFA allegations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/julius-baer-in-talks-with-us-authorities-to-resolve-fifa-allegations/46037360;Swiss bank Julius Bär says it may have to pay tens of millions of dollars to settle allegations by the United States over its role in a corruption affair concerning the world football body FIFA. Julius Bär said on Wednesday that it had been cooperating with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) since 2015 in its investigation of alleged money laundering and corruption involving officials and affiliates of FIFA and associated sports media and marketing companies. “The bank is currently in advanced discussions with the DOJ about reaching a resolution in such matter, which may result in the payment of a double-digit million US dollar amount,” it said in a statement.External link The affair dates back to era of former chief executive Boris Collardi, who is now at the Pictet private bank. FIFA was embroiled in the worst corruption scandal in its history in 2015 which led to several officials being indicted in the US on corruption-related charges. Julius Bär this year was reprimanded by Switzerland’s financial supervisor FINMA for ignoring money laundering risks of FIFA-linked payments, while an ex-banker was convicted in 2017 in US District Court of conspiracy charges for arranging payments from a sports marketing executive to the Argentine soccer association’s president. The Swiss bank has already been sanctioned this year in relation to money laundering offences and it was also ordered pay CHF153 million ($169 million) to settle a claim that one of its subsidiaries pilfered money from Germany during the reunification of the country in the 1990s. In its media statement, the Swiss wealth manager also said that it planned to propose the distribution of the second part of its 2019 dividend at an extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for November. Julius Bär was among Swiss banks that proposed splitting its CHF1.5 ($1.7) per share dividend this year out of caution over the coronavirus’s impact on finances.
2020-09-16;Immigration vote: ‘The People’s Party campaign just hasn’t caught on’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-the-people-s-party-campaign-just-hasn-t-caught-on-/46037326;On September 27, the Swiss will vote on an initiative to abolish the free movement of people deal with the European Union. With new concerns on the agenda, however, voters are no longer so het up about the bugbear of immigration, says political analyst Martina Mousson. Six years ago, as the country prepared to vote on another initiative to curb mass immigration, the tension was palpable. Media was full of fiery debates, conversations were heated, and political campaigning provocative. In the end, the proposal by the Swiss People’s Party was accepted by a slim majority. Nothing of the sort is being seen now, less than two weeks before a vote on the latest People’s Party proposal, which aims to scrap the free movement of people agreement with the EU. Though the rightwing group – Switzerland’s biggest party – is again trying to raise the spectre of the threat of foreigners, the strategy isn’t working as well as it once did. Concerns have shifted, explains Martina Mousson, a political scientist at the GfS Bern polling and research institute. swissinfo.ch: The campaign around the immigration initiative seems drab. Is this also your impression, as a political scientist? Martina Mousson: The debates are definitely not as fierce as those around previous People’s Party initiatives. The campaign visual [a massive rear end of a European sitting on and squashing Switzerland] is also less provocative than before. In the past, visuals could be more racist – for example, the famous posters of black sheep symbolising foreigners, or those showing crows stealing Swiss passports. This time the issue is less emotive. It’s also not the first time we are voting on relations with the EU. Polls show that citizens’ opinions are already solidly formed. In this context, it’s more difficult to make an effective campaign. swissinfo.ch: In 2014, the People’s Party initiative against mass immigration sparked heated debates. What has changed? M.M.: The context is not the same. In 2014, Europe was in the midst of a major migration crisis. There was a fear of seeing a wave of immigrants arrive, a wave which the country couldn’t absorb. Today, we know that immigration numbers are falling. Aside from the coronavirus, other issues have taken precedence in public debate, eclipsing the old issue of foreigners. The reform of the pension system is a big concern for a lot of politicians, especially since a solution hasn’t yet been found. The environment has risen up the agenda, as we saw with the Green Party gains in last year’s parliamentary elections. swissinfo.ch: How has the coronavirus crisis impacted the campaign? M.M.: The pandemic forced the vote to be put back from May to September. Campaigning had already kicked off in spring, but it then became stretched out over half a year. This unusual [for Switzerland] length of time perhaps meant it lost some momentum. For the parties, it also meant additional costs. And with social distancing measures, it’s more difficult to go out into the streets, to talk to people and distribute flyers. This exceptional situation has played a role. swissinfo.ch: Polls by your GfS Bern institute have predicted the initiative will be roundly rejected. Has the People’s Party already accepted it will lose at the ballot box M.M.: That’s not what the party is communicating, in any case. A lot of members have been mobilised and are speaking out, especially on social media. The People’s Party is doing its best to fuel the campaign – it just hasn’t caught on. swissinfo.ch: Is the immigration issue, so dear to the People’s Party, no longer popular? M.M.: You could say something like that. We already saw this trend during the parliamentary elections last year, when the party lost some support. The issue can nonetheless be revived at any moment, if immigration starts to increase again. swissinfo.ch: Is the party capable of refocussing on other issues? M.M.: There have always been other issues, but none has worked as well as immigration or relations with the EU. This time, the party tried to make an ecological link, arguing that too much immigration will be harmful for the environment, but this isn’t credible. At the moment, the People’s Party is focussed on its electoral base – an effective strategy, since it has a stronger internal mobilisation power than other parties. To attract new voters, however, it needs new faces, new issues and new angles. swissinfo.ch: In 2014, a few weeks before the vote, it was also predicted that the initiative against mass immigration would fail. In the end it was accepted. Could we see such a reversal again? M.M.: All indicators point towards a “no” vote. The People’s Party is alone against everyone. However, an unforeseen event could change the situation and create a climate that would lead to a groundswell in favour of the text. swissinfo.ch: After a long period of popular successes, the People’s Party has been failing at the ballot box in recent years. Is Switzerland’s largest party in decline? M.M.: I don’t think so. Even if it hasn’t managed to reach its objective of winning over 30% of the electorate, we shouldn’t forget that the People’s Party is still the biggest in Switzerland.

2020-09-16;Cobalt can be sourced responsibly, and it’s time to act;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cobalt-can-be-sourced-responsibly--and-it-s-time-to-act/46031364;"Business and human rights professor Dorothée Baumann-Pauly calls for human rights to be at the centre of a “green recovery” from the coronavirus pandemic and argues the cobalt mining industry is ripe for change. Electric vehicle sales are booming. With many European governments subsidising electric vehicle purchases and more calls for a “green recovery” or to “build back better” after Covid-19, this trend is likely to accelerate. Yet, what is good for the planet currently comes at a high human cost. An electric vehicle’s battery typically contains around eight kilograms of cobalt – a mineral predominantly mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Between 15 and 30% of the world’s cobalt originates from small, so-called artisanal mines in the DRC, where miners dig 100-metre-deep tunnels to extract the precious metal with basic tools. Fatal accidents and child labour are common, yet these artisanal mines constitute a lifeline for millions of Congolese who have no other source of income. Faced with these human rights risks, car manufacturers like BMW and Volkswagen, along with industrial mining companies and commodity traders such as Swiss firm Glencore, are trying to avoid either artisanally mined cobalt from the DRC or Congolese cobalt altogether. But rejecting Congolese artisanal mines is not a solution. The reality is that for companies that need cobalt there is no viable alternative to the DRC, which produces more than two thirds of the world’s cobalt and owns half of the world’s cobalt reserves. If the electric car industry continues growing, alternative sourcing locations like Australia and Morocco,  won’t be able to meet global demand. Together, they produce only 5% of the world’s cobalt. Most companies state that they only buy directly from industrial mining sites that utilise heavy machinery. But if you buy cobalt from the DRC, you can’t avoid buying from artisanal mines. Last year, I travelled to the DRC to conduct independent research supported by the World Economic Forum that looked at three pilot projects (Mutoshi, Kasulo and Kisote) that aim to formalise artisanal mining of cobalt and ensure a responsible cobalt supply chain. My own observations confirm what others such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have found: artisanal mining is a business reality in the DRC, interwoven with industrial mining. Artisanal miners regularly dig on industrial mining concessions and sell to buyers that mix the material before sending it off to China, where around 90% of cobalt is processed. Blockchain projects to trace cobalt’s origins are underway, but the realities in the DRC make proper implementation difficult. Last year, a senior executive of a car manufacturer told me confidentially that despite efforts to keep their supply chain free from artisanally mined cobalt, they “would never sign in blood that it is free of artisanal mining or child labour”. While companies like Tesla are working on alternatives to cobalt for car batteries, full adoption of such new technology is still a decade away according to experts. As a sign that DRC cobalt is here to stay for the near future, Tesla recently struck a deal with Glencore to source Congolese cobalt for its new car plants. More than two million Congolese work in artisanal mining in the DRC, so excluding the practice altogether also has huge consequences for people’s livelihoods and the entire Congolese economy. There is a way to source cobalt so that our green recovery from the pandemic also builds a better supply chain, where artisanal miners are not hiding on the fringes in unsafe conditions. In a new reportExternal link published in the World Economic Forum White Paper series, I argue that car manufacturers and other cobalt buyers need to commit to a common standard for responsible cobalt sourcing that includes three elements. First, companies that need cobalt must acknowledge that the future of cobalt is in the DRC and that comes with risks and responsibilities. If you want to do business in the DRC, human rights must be a top priority in the company. Companies also need to help formalise artisanal mining activities to make mining practices safe and fair. This requires steps such as establishing monitoring to ensure children and other vulnerable groups don’t access mines; and introducing safety measures such as limiting pit depth, preparing open pits and providing protective equipment. Some companies, for example the Swiss-based commodity trading firm Trafigura, have already piloted cobalt formalisation projectsExternal link that offer some insight into how to do this. The third key element is for companies to not just focus on change at one mine here or there but rather for the entire industry and the cobalt supply chain. This is currently underway in the context of the Cobalt Action Partnership, an initiative of the Global Battery AllianceExternal link. The initiative includes over 50 stakeholders across the entire battery supply chain. To build back better, we need a cobalt supply chain that prioritises human rights with standards backed by the entire industry.

2020-09-16;Anti-EU immigration initiative set to flop, pollsters say;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/anti-eu-immigration-initiative-set-to-flop--pollsters-say/46034096;A right-wing proposal to scrap an immigration accord with the European Union is unlikely to win approval in a nationwide vote later this month. But voters look set to back CHF6 billion ($6.6 billion) for fighter jets and the introduction of a statutory paternity leave. Two other issues on the ballot paper on September 27 – a reform of the hunting law and tax deductions for families with children – have lost ground, according to an opinion poll commissioned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, swissinfo.ch's parent company. For more details see the chart below. The leading GfS Bern research institute, which carried out the survey about three weeks before the vote, found no major shift in public opinions since March over the proposed changes to Swiss immigration policy. “Opinions were formed a while ago,” says GfS Bern project leader and political scientist Martina Mousson. “This is hardly surprising since it's not the first time that voters have been asked before to decide on proposals by right-wing groups about immigration restrictions.” Supporters are 28 percentage points behind opponents, who have warned that approval of the initiative would further damage the country’s prosperity in times of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has strained the economy. Switzerland is not a member of the EU – which in turn is Switzerland’s main trading partner – but a bilateral accord on the free movement of people ensures access to each other’s labour markets. Supporters of the initiative, however, argue that Switzerland should manage its immigration independently from Brussels because the country risks being overcrowded, putting excessive pressure on the environment, on the social security system and on salaries of employees. Wildlife and tax benefits A reform of the hunting law and tax benefits for families with children appear to be losing their voter appeal, according to the GfS Bern researchers. In a marked development since a first opinion poll in August, opponents of regulations aimed at easing the protection of wolves have caught up and are running neck-and-neck with supporters of the reform. “Several indicators show rejection of the law. But it is too close to call at the moment,” says GfS co-director Lukas Golder. Environmental groups as well as left-wing parties have criticised the parliamentary decision as “a botched piece of legislation”, forcing a referendum. The political left also stands a chance of winning a second challenge on September 27. Their campaign to bring down tax breaks for childcare and general fiscal reductions for families appears to have had some success. Opponents now have a nine percentage point advantage. In a first survey supporters were in the lead. The contentious point is whether well-off families will benefit exclusively from the tax breaks. There is a clear trend among supporters of several political parties, age groups, social classes and in the different language regions against the tax breaks, according to pollsters. Paternity leave and fighter jets No surprises are expected in the votes on the introduction of a statutory paternity leave in Switzerland, nor in a referendum about a multi-billion credit package to upgrade the Swiss air force. Supporters of a ten-day paid leave for fathers of newborns have a clear lead – nearly 30% – over opponents, who mainly come from the political right and centre-right as well as the main organisation representing small and medium-sized businesses. Barring a major political upset, Switzerland is poised to introduce paternity leave more than 15 years after it enshrined a 14-week maternity leave in law. Finally, voters are also set to rebuff a challenge by left-wing and pacifist groups about replacing the air force’s fighter jet fleet. Parliament and the government have come out in favour of the funds. The latest poll shows opponents 16 percentage points behind. A previous vote on the purchase of new fighter jets ended in a defeat for the government at the ballot box six years ago. Campaign and turnout What impact has the coronavirus pandemic had on the campaign so far? It’s been difficult for campaigners to stir up opposition despite or because of the Covid-19 crisis, says Golder. “Citizens seem to be able to make informed decisions,” he says. “Based on our research, voters won’t use their ballot sheet to express their frustration with a straight set of ‘no’ votes.” “The most obvious impact of Covid-19 is that the votes scheduled for May were postponed to September,” adds his colleague Mousson. “Additional factors appear to have been shared out equally between opponents and supporters of the five separate issues at stake.” The pollsters expect turnout to be slightly above average, at around 47%. Following votes in February, it is only the second time this year that Swiss voters decide on nationwide issues. A vote set for May was cancelled due to the restrictions in public life over the Covid-19 pandemic.
2020-09-15;Night trains planned for Amsterdam, Rome and Barcelona;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-night-trains-planned-for-amsterdam--rome-and-barcelona/46035322;Train travellers will soon be able to go to sleep in Switzerland and wake up in cities including Amsterdam, Rome and Barcelona. Swiss Federal Railways and Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) have announced they want to expand their night-train service in Europe. “Demand for international night-train services significantly increased in 2019 and at the start of 2020 until the coronavirus crisis struck,” Swiss Federal Railways wrote in a statement on Tuesday. “The number of passengers using night-train services from Switzerland grew by over 25% with respect to the previous year.” It added that the two partner railways considered this a sustainable trend given the significant rise in customer demand for “environmentally friendly and resource-efficient travel”. With its 19 Nightjet lines and eight further services provided in cooperation with partner railways, ÖBB already runs Europe’s largest night-train network. This includes the network from Switzerland run in cooperation with Swiss Federal Railways, comprising six lines. Over the past few months, the two companies have evaluated various options for expanding the service. In a letter of intent signed last week, they outlined a strategy that would increase the Nightjet network from Switzerland to incorporate a total of ten lines and 25 destinations. As a first step in the expansion process, the two companies want to launch a daily Nightjet service running from Zurich to Amsterdam via Basel-Frankfurt-Cologne in December 2021. A new line will run from Zurich to Rome via Bern-Brig-Domodossola. There are also plans for a daily connection from Zurich to Barcelona via Bern-Lausanne-Geneva. In addition, the capacity of the connections from Zurich to Berlin and Hamburg via Basel is to be expanded “significantly”. The plan is to serve both destinations with two separate trains covering the whole route, “if possible from the 2023 timetable change”. They also plan to run the service to Prague via Germany as a portion of the Berlin Nightjet with sleeping cars and couchettes. The new route would also provide a direct connection to Leipzig and Dresden. The dismantling of the Swiss sleeper network began 15 years ago, and since then more and more direct overnight routes have disappeared. Previous destinations such as Brussels, Rome, Barcelona, Moscow and Copenhagen are no longer on the timetable. In 2009 Swiss Federal Railways ended its night-train service with its own sleepers and German Railways did the same in 2016. Austrian Federal Railways took over some of the routes. 
2020-09-15;Crypto Nation Switzerland evades Covid’s clutches (for now);https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/crypto-nation-switzerland-evades-covid-s-clutches--for-now-/46030606;The Swiss blockchain industry appears to be in rude health despite the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of new companies and jobs produced by the sector increased in the first six months of the year. Is this trend set to last? The number of Crypto Nation (including Liechtenstein) blockchain ventures expanded from 842 at the end of 2019 to 919 in the second half of this year, according to a biannual industry survey. The number of people they hire also increased – from 4,400 to nearly 4,800. There has also been no shortage of private equity funding flowing into companies. These are the findings of the latest “Top 50” blockchain industry report from Crypto Valley Venture Capital (CV VC), Inacta and PwC Strategy&. The figures fly in the face warnings in the summer that Covid-19 could seriously damage the sector. The fear was that companies in other sectors would shelve or scrap collaborations with blockchain firms and that venture capitalists would pull up the drawbridge and avoid investing in risky ventures. Above all, many blockchain start-ups looked certain to fall through the gaps of emergency state bail-out loans because they were not yet generating revenues. Zug, the epicentre of the Swiss blockchain scene, even touted a public-private fund for ailing start-ups, but it never got off the ground. Has Crypto Nation defied the odds and beaten coronavirus? It’s too early to tell. Far fewer firms have gone bust across all industries so far this year compared to 2019. But this is an artificial state of affairs. The state has provided interest free loans, relief from paying bills, short-time working insurance and has given extra time for firms to sort out their difficulties before declaring insolvency. The Swiss Creditor Association (debt collection union) predicts the dam to burst in the next few months, leading to an increase of up to 60% in the number of bankruptcies by the end of the year. There is some reason to believe that the blockchain sector will be less affected than the likes of tourism and events management. Fintech and blockchain are being hailed as the solution to some pandemic induced problems. Digital is tipped to fill the social distancing void. Blockchain could reduce wealth inequality. Bitcoin says is the antidote to central banks debasing currencies with their printing machines. Some investors have retained faith in blockchain during the crisis. Bitcoin Suisse raised $48 million, 4ART Technologies $45 million, METACO $20 million, Crypto Finance $14 million, Near Protocol $12.1 million and Taurus an eight-digit sum*. The trick now is converting those millions into a return for investors. The industry continues to attract former political heavyweights to its ranks. CV VC, which doubles as an incubator for blockchain start-ups, has recruited former German government minister Philipp Rössler to its ranks as advisor, alongside ex-Swiss Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann and former Finnish minister Anne Berner. But it is almost inevitable that some of the 919 blockchain companies will fail. Some will run out of money before they produce the goods. Others will get their strategy wrong or fail to convince consumers with their technology. There are also suspicions that some projects are alive simply because they raised phenomenal amounts of cash during the ICO goldrush of 2017-2018. There is another link in the blockchain that needs to fall into place. The technology has been in development for more than a decade but it has yet to break through to mass consumers. There are hopes that law changes approved by Swiss parliament in the last few days will help kickstart the transition from niche alternative to mainstream standard. Switzerland has become the first major global economy to enact a comprehensive set of legal reforms to smooth the path for blockchain adoption. This could help the country import blockchain projects and companies seeking blockchain solutions. Exporting such services around the world may take more time. Although inroads have been made in Asia and the Middle East, the industry is still waiting for Europe and the US to work out how it will regulate blockchain and crypto assets. * Correction: while the Top 50 report says Taurus raised at least $8 million, the company has previously indicated the sum to be at least CHF10 million.
2020-09-15;Parliament approves increase in Swiss aid budget;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parliament-approves-increase-in-swiss-aid-budget/46034492;Parliament has approved a development aid budget of CHF11.25 billion ($12.42 billion) for 2021-2024, an increase of CHF147 million compared with the previous period. The lion’s share of the funding is for humanitarian aid (CHF8.78 billion), with the other pillars being peace and human security (CHF258 million), financing for Eastern European states (CHF1.025 billion), and economic development cooperation (CHF1.186 billion). As announced by the government in February, the new strategy foresees a reduction in the number of states with which it works and the focusing on four priority zones: the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia (Central, South and South-East), and Eastern Europe. It also plans to continue intensifying cooperation with the private sector. Much of the debate in parliament focused on the amount of aid allocated, which some politicians on the left said was too low. The only parliamentarians to oppose the budget were from the right-wing Swiss People’s Party. Carlo Sommaruga from the left-wing Social Democratic Party regretted that the proportion of the annual Swiss gross national income (GNI) set aside for development aid would amount to 0.48% over the three-year period. “We are far from the objectives set by the [United Nations’] 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” Sommaruga said. He said the amount was lower than what was previously demanded by parliament (0.5% of GNI), and lower again than the objective set by the international community 50 years ago (0.7%). Given the current economic situation, the coronavirus pandemic, and the uncertainty of the coming years, it would not be wise to raise the budget even more right now, said Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
2020-09-14;Merger rumours boost UBS and Credit Suisse shares;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/merger-rumours-boost-ubs-and-credit-suisse-shares/46032312;Shares of Credit Suisse and UBS moved to the top of SMI stocks on Monday after a media report said the Swiss banks were planning a merger. The chairmen of UBS Group and Credit Suisse Group were exploring a potential merger to create one of Europe’s largest banks, wrote Inside Paradeplatz, citing unidentified people inside the two lenders. The project, nicknamed Signal, is being driven by UBS Chairman Axel Weber, who is working on it with his counterpart at Credit Suisse, Urs Rohner, the Swiss finance blog said. Weber has discussed the idea with Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer and an agreement could happen by early next year, according to the report. A merger could result in job cuts equal to between 10% and 20% of the workforce, or 15,000 or more worldwide, according to the report. Banking regulator FINMA had been informed of the deliberations, Inside Paradeplatz said. Spokespeople for the two banks declined to comment to Bloomberg. “Necessity is the key to fusionism,” one market observer said on the speculation. Europe’s banking industry is under pressure to consolidate as the coronavirus pandemic adds to headwinds from negative interest rates. Shares in Credit Suisse had gained 4.4% and UBS 2.5% by 5pm on Monday. However, both shares have so far this year been down 23% and 7% respectively.
2020-09-14;Younger generation largely welcomes anti-Covid measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/younger-generation-largely-welcomes-anti-covid-measures/46031744;Growing awareness of poverty and old age is one of the key findings of a survey of 16- to 25-year-olds in Switzerland, the United States, Brazil and Singapore. The coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated that the younger generation takes a constructive approach and stands together with other generations in difficult times such as these, according to the 2020 Youth Barometer External linkby the Credit Suisse bank. “Young people in all the countries covered in the survey take a pragmatic view of the measures to tackle the coronavirus crisis, and fundamental criticism of the system is uncommon,” the authors said in a press release published on Monday. Respondents in all four countries said they wanted to see greater self-sufficiency at a national level and they considered the global production processes and supply chains with scepticism, the survey found. “At least 60% of respondents in all countries said the crisis showed that a reduction in consumption is feasible,” said Cloé Jans, operations manager at the GfS Bern research institute. The institute polled about 1,000 people aged 16-25 on behalf of Credit Suisse. Similar surveys have been published since 2010. Sustainability and equality are now seen as key issues for the young generation, the authors of the survey conclude. The top ten “insights” identified by the pollsters include an increasing political engagement by the younger generation, support for the government instead of accusations of failure, lower consumption and less fear of missing out. A particular finding among the younger generation in Switzerland is the concern about the future of the old-age pension system.
2020-09-14;Masks, half-empty lecture halls: Swiss universities’ hybrid approach;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/masks--half-empty-lecture-halls--swiss-universities--hybrid-approach/46024226;"The USI university in Ticino, one of the most coronavirus-affected parts of Switzerland, has chosen a 50/50 split between campus and online teaching for the autumn semester. Enrolment numbers among students from neighbouring Italy suggest this approach is popular. Other Swiss universities have also gone for a hybrid approach as institutions reopen on September 14 under the shadow of Covid-19. “Collaborating, having conversations with professors, assistants and colleagues that go well beyond classroom discussions, this can hardly be replaced online,” said Lorenzo Cantoni, of the Università della Svizzera italianaExternal link (USI) in the Italian-speaking canton Ticino, explaining why the university had opted for the 50/50 system. “All of us our feeling thrilled, excited and worried at the same time,” the pro-rector for Education and Students’ Experience told swissinfo.ch ahead of the new semester. Some colleagues and students at USI will require special measures, like live streaming of classes, as they are in the risk categories; first year freshmen will have special welcoming activities; support will be offered to foreign students who have to quarantine after arrival. It will be a “new normal”, he said. Cantoni says pre-enrolments from students in Italy are up 25% on last year, which might mean the university’s approach is being seen as a reference point in these volatile times. Final numbers will be known in October. As we have previously reported, the coronavirus situation was particularly difficult for the university’s 1,455 Italian students and members of staff (a third of faculty). Many returned home and some were directly affected by the consequences of the virus. Across Switzerland around 260,000 students started the autumn semester on Monday. The spring lockdown forced universities into distance teaching, (restrictions were eased after June 8, but many continued with former measures). However re-offering campus lectures will require social distancing, such as through empty chairs between attendees. The wearing of masks will also be widespread. This echoes much of what is happening internationally. At the University of BaselExternal link, Switzerland’s oldest, two-thirds of students will be doing distance-learning. “For students this means that they will have to stay at home for a while and will have less social contact,” rector Andrea Schenker-Wicki told Swiss public television SRFExternal link in August. The university has heavily invested in new technology for this step. This has also been introduced because the university – like many across the country – has reportedExternal link higher student numbers this year, which will stretch their capacity in these times of social distancing. Many will be freshmen unable to take their traditional gap years, or those choosing to carry on studying due to lack of alternatives because of the economic downturn. Some institutions have come up with more innovative schemes for the new semester: the University of LausanneExternal link has devised a of three-colour virtual token allocation system that will allow students to be divided into three groups for courses normally attended by a large number of people. These groups will then come in at different times. Students and staff there will have to wear masks, as they will in Basel (members there will receive a certified fabric mask in the post beforehand). At USI, masks are required if social distancing can’t be assured. Masks are particularly important for the more profession-oriented courses at the Universities of Applied Sciences. Here practical courses for midwifery and physiotherapy will have to take place with participants masked up and paying special attention to hand and clothes hygiene. Most students are looking forward to going back to university for at least partial campus teaching, even if there are some uncertainties about how courses will take place either on-or offline, Francesco Bee, co-president of the Swiss Student UnionExternal link and a Basel University masters student, told swissinfo.ch via email. “It is understandable that universities cannot return to full face-to-face teaching due to the lack of capacity. A mixed approached makes sense,” said Bee, adding so did the mask requirement for certain modules. “There is no right path for all universities. The important thing is to ensure students’ health and that they can participate in all courses,” Bee added. For example, there must be clear guidelines in terms of access to technology and suitable rooms in which to work for students who can’t venture out due to health risks or who are in quarantine.  Universities also need to work on their digital teaching standards, Bee stressed. First year students will face particular challenges settling in. He said care must be taken in order to integrate them into everyday student life. It’s a sentiment shared by Cantoni of USI. “Informal learning is such a key part of the university experience.”"
2020-09-14;Student exchange programmes badly hit by Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/student-exchange-programmes-badly-hit-by-covid-19/46031620;The autumn semester begins in Swiss universities on Monday, but far fewer Swiss students are going abroad and far fewer foreign students are coming to Switzerland, according to a survey by the public radio, SRF. All institutions reported a decrease in exchange programmes of at least half, said SRF, which asked all ten Swiss universities and both federal technology institutes for their data and heard back from seven of them. It said the figures for foreign students in Switzerland had dropped by about 40% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Although there had been more applications for exchange programmes than usual at several universities this year, many had been withdrawn or postponed to the spring semester in the hope that travel will then be possible again without any restrictions. Normally, many students from Switzerland want to go on an exchange to China. At the University of Zurich, China was among the three most popular exchange countries last autumn semester. Other popular destinations include France, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, Australia, Sweden, Japan and Spain. But because of coronavirus exchanges are mainly limited to European countries. Students are still coming to Switzerland from China but significantly fewer than last year. This is not the case, however, at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich, where there are no exceptions. “The exchange outside Europe has been suspended by ETH Zurich for the autumn semester,” according to the media office. The University of Bern also says no one is travelling to China this semester. The same goes for the United States, with which the University of Lucerne this year has no exchange, unlike last year. The Covid-19 pandemic means many non-European countries are not accepting students. Online exchange? Nevertheless, “interest is unbroken,” maintains Ellen Krause, head of the international department at the University of Bern. Only a few students would completely forgo going on an exchange, she said. “Most of them simply choose another country or postpone the trip.” In theory, now that many people are working from home, it would also be possible to study abroad online. Krause disagrees. “We really want the study programme to be part of a stay abroad. This includes the exchange with other students, lecturers, the physical presence and participation in cultural life. An online exchange would be like taking part in a course and that would be a completely different matter,” she said.
2020-09-13;Swiss tourism industry demands new Covid-19 quarantine regime;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-tourism-industry-demands-new-coronavirus-quarantine-regime/46030644;Foreign visitors from Covid-19 high risk countries should be able to travel to Switzerland with negative corona tests and not have to go into quarantine, say tourism officials. Under Swiss regulations, anyone entering Switzerland from one of the high risk coronavirus countriesExternal link on a list regularly updated by the Federal Office of Public Health must go into quarantine for ten days to help curb the spread of Covid-19, or risk a fine. With only three months to go before the start of the winter season, the de facto holiday ban for guests from countries like France is causing huge concern for the tourism industry. “If French guests are absent in the autumn and winter season, we will be hit hard,” Martin Nydegger, director of Switzerland Tourism, told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper on September 13. The Valais region, with popular ski resorts such as Verbier, Zermatt and Crans-Montana, are particularly nervous. “There is a lot at stake for us,” said Christophe Darbellay, head of the Valais Department of Economic Affairs. Winter tourism brings in around CHF2 billion ($2.2 billion) a year. Half of the winter tourists come from abroad, mostly from Europe, according to NZZ . Tourism officials agree that an enforced testing strategy and a shorter quarantine period are needed. “The ten-day quarantine period is far too long,” said Darbellay. “We need to test more, and faster, and to shorten the quarantine period.” The twenty largest tourism associations from the hotel, catering, travel and aviation industries are now calling for a new quarantine regime. “The quarantine period must be reduced wherever possible,” said Nydegger. “We demand that business and leisure travellers from risky areas with a negative corona test that is not older than 48 hours should be able to enter Switzerland.” Foreign health authorities must also agree that return travellers with a negative corona test from Switzerland can re-enter their home country. The coalition of Swiss tourism organisations also want Covid-19 test centres to be set up at airports and at the main entry points into Switzerland. NZZ am Sonntag said the interior ministry was examining whether the quarantine period should be shortened.
2020-09-13;Swiss interior minister warns over ‘imported’ anti-coronavirus movement;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-health-minister-warns-over--imported--anti-coronavirus-movement/46030358;Interior  Minister Alain Berset has defended Switzerland's coronavirus strategy against criticism from Covid-19 sceptics. He warns that the protest movement in the Alpine nation is being partly imported from abroad. “It’s clear that a movement is being built here against our fact-driven and democratic society,” Berset told SonntagsZeitungExternal link in a lengthy interview on Sunday. On Saturday, an anti-corona demo in Geneva attracted 1,000 protesters. This follows a similar, but smaller, rally in German-speaking Switzerland the previous weekend. Corona sceptics in Switzerland are a mixed group - a “noisy minority” - with diverse ideologies coming together, including “rightwing extremists, radical anti-vaccination campaigners and obscure conspiracy theorists”, said Berset. “Some of the anti-corona movement seems to be imported from abroad,” he declared, explaining that he had seen examples of anti-corona videos in Switzerland which originated from Germany and the United States. Berset said he welcomed “fact-based discussions” over the dangers of the virus and Swiss measures. “But I have little sympathy for the current tendency to deny the virus, which is causing much suffering worldwide, and even accuse the authorities of dictatorial behaviour. That is absurd. Switzerland is one of the more liberal countries when it comes to corona measures,” he declared. After imposing unprecedented restrictions on public life to contain the pandemic in spring, Switzerland has eased its measures and re-opened its land borders. But since mid-June there has been a worrying rise in new cases of Covid-19. Face masks are now mandatory on Swiss public transport. The federal government is leaving it up to cantons to decide how far they should go with mask mandates, although it has encouraged cantons to require them in closed public places. Berset admitted that there had been “inconsistencies”, especially at the beginning of the pandemic and “communication glitches”. But he said the government had received great support from the Swiss public. “We implemented the law on epidemics passed by the people. In addition, the Federal Council has always acted with a sense of proportion, always giving the needs of society and the economy the highest possible priority. Epidemiologists accuse us of having been too hesitant in issuing the restrictions and then too brisk in reopening them. It is nonsensical and dishonest to accuse us of dictatorial behaviour now. I have no sympathy for this,” he said. Switzerland has witnessed a rise in new cases in recent weeks. On September 12, the seven-day average for Switzerland reached 373.7 new cases per day, which is a 19% increase from the previous week. On September 13, the Federal Office of Public Health recorded 475 new infections across the country - Vaud, Zurich, Geneva, Fribourg, Bern and Aargau are the worst-affected cantons. “We are not experiencing exponential growth at the moment. The case numbers are high, but are growing much more slowly than in the spring,” he said. “At the moment we have fewer hospitalisations and fewer deaths in relation to the number of cases. The virus currently circulates more in younger generations, where there are far fewer vulnerable people… we must also ensure that the virus does not spread to older generations.” The minister warned that the fight against the virus would go on “for a long time”. “After the relaxation phase there will probably be a phase that will require more discipline from us again. I am convinced that this discipline can be mobilised again very quickly if the situation worsens again,” he declared. But a second lockdown must be prevented “at all costs”, said Berset: “We must succeed in preventing this with easier, more targeted and, if possible, regional measures and good contact tracing.”
2020-12-20;Geneva anti-mask demo attracts 1,000 protesters;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-anti-mask-demo-attracts-1-000-protesters/46029604;"Around 1,000 people took part in a demonstration in Geneva on Saturday to protest against the mandatory use of face masks and other Covid-19 measures. Crowds gathered at the Place des Nations outside the United Nations headquarters on Saturday afternoon demanding the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. They denounced the mandatory wearing of face masks in certain situations and measures imposed by politicians; they also took a swipe at the media for its coronavirus coverage. The flags of Switzerland, France, the United States and Sweden were visible in the crowds. Only a small minority of those present wore hygiene masks. Protesters booed the World Health Organization (WHO), which has its headquarters in Geneva, and criticised the global health body for its efforts to find a Covid-19 vaccine. Some accused the WHO of being controlled by outside interests. The Geneva demo follows a smaller anti-mask rally in canton Uri, in German-speaking Switzerland last weekend. Similar protests were held in several Swiss cities in May when there was a nationwide ban on more than five people gathering in public places. Since then restrictions on gatherings have eased. Private and public events of up to 1,000 people have been allowed since June 22, as long as contact tracing can be guaranteed. On August 12, the government announced that events with more than 1,000 people – notably festivals and sporting events – would be allowed against starting on October 1. Face masks are mandatory on Swiss public transport, air flights and at Basel and Geneva airports. The federal government is leaving it up to cantons to decide how far they should go with mask mandates, although it has encouraged cantons to require them in closed public places. However, the face-mask issue has dogged Switzerland’s authorities throughout the pandemic, with every change in policy met by fierce public and political debate. Nine cantons (Zurich, Vaud, Geneva, Basel City, Valais, Neuchâtel, Fribourg, Solothurn and Jura) have decided to make face masks mandatory in shops. While there is generally no mask wearing in primary schools, several cantons are requiring masks be worn among post-compulsory pupils, aged 15-16, when social distancing of at least 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. Switzerland has witnessed a rise in new cases in recent weeks. On September 11, the seven-day average for Switzerland reached 373.7 new cases per day, which is a 19% increase from the previous week. On September 12, the Federal Office of Public Health recorded 465 new infections across the country - Vaud, Zurich, Geneva, Fribourg, Bern and Aargau are the worst affected cantons."
2020-12-20;Marc Bauer, an artist overwhelmed by too many crises and prizes;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/marc-bauer--an-artist-overwhelmed-by-too-many-crises-and-prizes/46024110;"At the Berlinische Galerie, the Swiss artist Marc Bauer has been drawing in charcoal directly onto the high interior walls of the Berlin museum for ten hours a day. It is the run-up to the September 9 opening of “The Blow-Up Regime,” his solo exhibition encompassing such vast themes as the internet, climate change and authoritarian regimes. He says he’s tired. “I’ll take a holiday after this,” he laughs. “I like this short and intense period when I live with the work for 15 hours a day for a couple of weeks.” Bauer, 45, is the winner of the 2020 GASAG prize for art relating to technology and science, which includes an exhibition at the Berlinische GalerieExternal link that runs until April 5, 2021. Just a few weeks after learning he had been awarded the prize, he found out he had also won the 2020 Prix Meret Oppenheim, the main Swiss art prize. “I was a bit overwhelmed,” he says. “I wanted to do a show about now,” he says. “I have the feeling we are living in a succession of crises, political, social or ecological. We forgot about the migration crisis, but it’s still there. We are totally overwhelmed by all this. Exceptional seems to be the new normal.” Though the exhibition was conceived before the coronavirus pandemic, the apocalyptic overtones give it a sense of dread, doom – even terror -- that matches our era. A musical recording by Thomas Kuratli, a composer from St Gallen, adds to the menace with sounds of heavy breathing, oppressive military-style band marches and echoing bangs and clashes, interspersed with more dreamlike electronic sequences. Born in Geneva, Bauer studied at the Ecole Supérieure d’Art Visuel there. He has taught at the Zurich University of the Arts since 2015. Previous solo exhibitions have taken place at the Folkwang Museum in Essen, Frieze Projects in London. Earlier this year, at the Istituto Svizzero in Milan, he used tweets sent by Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister until 2019, to explore the political and manipulative use of images and language. “The Blow-Up Regime” is Bauer’s first solo exhibition in a museum in Berlin, which - alongside Zurich - is his home town. He says he finds it easier to focus in Berlin than in Zurich, where he has a busier social life. “Usually when I am in Berlin I concentrate on my work,” he says.  “In Berlin you can see 20,000 people if you want, but you can also very easily live like a hermit in your flat or in your studio. I find that very comfortable. Here I am much more disciplined, Berlin is much more anonymous.” The first section of the two-room exhibition at the Berlinische Galerie displays works on paper focusing on the history of the internet and the relationship between war and computer science, with portraits of computer pioneers such as John von Neumann, Konrad Zuse and Tim Berners-Lee. Three drawings positioned side-by-side, showing the V2, Apollo 11 and the SpaceX rocket, reveal how the purpose of rocket science has evolved from weaponry to space exploration to tourism over the decades. The catalogue includes a conversation between Bauer and Alan Emtage, who in 1989 developed Archie, widely considered the first internet search engine. “The internet has become an increasingly important part of our lives for absolutely all the different activities in our life,” Bauer says. “It is also the place that creates the most wealth. As a visual artist I find it is the most incredible source of images and the creation of cultures. In a way it’s a matrix for a lot of stories and ways of thinking, good and bad.” A charcoal gun on the wall at the entrance of the second, much larger hall points visitors towards a more nightmarish, threatening vision of the future – or is it the present? Two giant wall drawings show the Capitol Building in Washington. In one, a military parade dominates the foreground with colourful soap bubbles floating overhead; the second contains references to zombie-fighting video-games and images of torture, death and destruction borrowed from Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s “Triumph of Death.” Below it is a series of drawings accompanying extracts from Sibylle Berg’s novel “GRM Brainfuck,” which follows four neglected teenagers living on depressed council estates in the northern English town of Rochdale. They spend most of their time glued to smartphones watching “grime” music videos. Bauer says he admires the “directness” of Berg’s writing. Another work in the same room borrows from Japanese manga imagery to address what Bauer describes as the “vortex of void” that can suck up internet users. Though the exhibition comprises many separate drawings, Bauer thinks of it as a single work. “It’s one big project,” he says. “If you extract one image, it doesn’t have a lot of meaning without the others. If you take just one drawing you lose a lot of context and content. I really like this idea of building a big narrative, each drawing is a fragment of narrative. Of course, some images function a bit better alone than others. It is difficult for me to dismantle the show. I always have the feeling that it cuts the work in a very brutal way.” This concept also creates difficulties when it comes to sales, he concedes. “I always try to put a priority on institutions so we can make a special price for the whole thing, or at least a part that makes sense,” he says. “I can understand that private collectors don’t want to buy 10 drawings, but if I sell individual pieces, I will redo the drawings so that my set is always complete.” He says he enjoys the fact that with drawing – unlike, for example, photography -- each work is an original, even if it is a copy. “The copy of a copy is still an original,” he says. There is a contradiction in the artist’s choice of the very analogue, ancient medium of drawing to examine our multimedial, digital present (although the exhibition does include drawings on electronic paper too). “Drawing is a very slow medium to produce an image, so it pauses the flux of images a bit,” Bauer says. He also sees it as a way to distance the viewer from the original scene or item portrayed. “In this gap between the original and the drawing, the viewer fills the gap with his own memory or experience,” he says. I am interested in that. Drawings function more like triggers than an image you experience.” "
2020-11-20;Parts of France and Austria put on Swiss quarantine list ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parts-of-france-and-austria-put-on-swiss-quarantine-list-/46027664;Switzerland will not put its neighbours on its coronavirus high-risk list but travellers from specific regions in France and Austria will be required to quarantine themselves. Border regions will not in principle be put on the high-risk list.  The measures will come into force from Monday September 14, Health Minister Alain Berset announced on Friday. He said one region of Austria (Vienna) and nine regions of France including Paris were being put on the high-risk list.   This means Swiss residents should refrain from going to those regions unless absolutely necessary, Berset explained. Anyone returning from there must go into quarantine for 10 days. There are some exceptions such as for medical or professional reasons.    Berset said the government had decided on a pragmatic solution because of the “intense exchange” that takes place in border regions and the number of cross-border workers in cities like Geneva and Basel. Other countries have also adopted the practice of putting regions rather than whole countries on their “red list”. Belgium, for example, has put some Swiss cantons on its list.   The minister noted that cases were rising in European countries and also in Switzerland, where the number of new daily infections has just passed 500.  The new cases are mostly among people under 40, he said, while the numbers of hospitalisations and deaths are low.   He said countries were working together to keep the situation under control and maintain vital contact tracing. The situation is very different from at the beginning of the pandemic, Berset stressed, and the aim was not to close borders.   The regions of France that will be on Switzerland's risk list from Monday are: Centre-Val de Loire, Corsica, Hauts-de-France, Île de France (the Paris region), Normandy, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Pays de la Loire and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur. There are also a number of French overseas territories (French Guyana, Guadeloupe, French Polynesia, Réunion, Martinique, Mayotte, Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin). 
2020-11-20;No wave of coronavirus bankruptcies so far, study finds ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/no-wave-of-coronavirus-bankruptcies-so-far--study-finds-/46027004;Government credits and employment support measures have helped stave off a wave of bankruptcies, but they could rise over the longer term, says a survey.  Between January and August 2020, which includes the lockdown period, 2,800 firms in Switzerland declared bankruptcy. This is actually 621 fewer than in the same period last year, says the study by the Swiss association of creditors Creditreform.  The association’s experts put this down to government support measures such as emergency interest free loans for companies hit by the crisis and employment support such as short time working subsidies. But they warn of a possible rise in bankruptcies over the longer term amid a tougher economic climate.  “The consequences of the coronavirus crisis on company bankruptcies are difficult to evaluate,” Creditreform stresses. But it said a 60% rise to more than 8,000 over the year is “not an unrealistic scenario”.  On Wednesday, government experts at the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) forecasted GDP to fall by 5% this year. This was slightly revised downwards from a previous forecast of -6,2%.  
2020-11-20;Switzerland lags behind in Covid-19 testing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-lags-behind-in-covid-19-testing/46026830;The Alpine nation is testing for coronavirus less than its European neighbours or the US, says a report by the Swiss public broadcaster.  During the summer, an average of 5.3 people out of 1,000 were given the smear test every week, according to an analysis by RTS published today. In neigbouring France and Germany, the figure was closer to 8 and as high as 17.6 in the US.    When questioned by RTS, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) responded that a lack of capacity was not the problem. According to the FOPH, the maximum testing capacity fluctuates between 20,000 and 25,000 samples per day compared to the 16,000 to 17,000 tests currently being carried out. However, the FOPH says it is working to ensure an even greater volume .  Other factors behind the numbers are that testing in in Switzerland is done in traditional medical structures like hospitals and clinics and almost exclusively on people showing symptoms of the virus. According to the FOPH, the responsibility for deciding who gets tested lies with the cantons. To improve access, the federal authorities recommend expanding the pool of testing options such as drive-in centres. 
2020-11-20;Sustainable tourism may prosper amid coronavirus crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sustainable-tourism-may-prosper-amid-coronavirus-crisis/46022252;The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the Swiss tourism industry, as holidaymakers rethink their booking and travel habits. Aurelia Kogler, a professor of tourism, sees the crisis as an opportunity for a more sustainable form of leisure travel to gain favour. swissinfo.ch: What changes in tourists’ behaviour have you observed? Aurelia Kogler: The Swiss are now spending their holidays in their own country. That was always a goal of the tourism industry. The restrictions that were imposed as a result of the pandemic seem to have led to this change in demand. The summer season was saved thanks to Swiss tourists. The summer also turned out better than expected for mountain destinations. But this was not the case for the city travel sector. The crisis has also affected all the tourism service providers that depend on large-scale events for their revenue. What else have you observed? The demand for holiday apartments also increased disproportionately this summer. This was probably due partly to the hygiene and distancing rules, and partly to the need to feel safe. We’ve also seen that the long-haul travel market has completely collapsed. Right now it’s impossible to visit certain countries, either because there is an entry ban, or because there are simply not enough flights. Other regions are accessible, but there is a certain risk involved and several restrictions too. People also ask themselves when they’re choosing a destination whether it’s really worth the trouble. But the Swiss love to fly… Yes, the Swiss love traveling abroad. But this has changed completely. If, despite all the drama, we want to find a silver lining in this situation, we could say that the pandemic has made our modes of travel more sustainable. It remains to be seen if this change in behaviour will continue when the situation goes back to normal. But at the moment the environment is definitely benefiting from a reduction in the number of flights and distances travelled. Could the crisis be the starting point for a more sustainable form of tourism? Eco-tourism has been a niche sector for decades. In recent years the issue of sustainability has become more important. The idea has not only been introduced in different legal texts, but also evolved into a type of behaviour that’s appreciated socially. The pandemic has actually led to a questioning, and at least temporarily, to a change in behaviour. Will this trend continue? As tourism professionals, we are of course curious to see which aspects of people’s behaviours will become part of our DNA as travellers. We’ll have to see if we’re a bit less negligent in the future about flying off for a weekend here, and a weekend there, just because we can. We also have to hope that the demand for summer holidays in the mountains will become a long-term trend. When we see the number of families that spent part of their summer in the mountains, we can only hope that they saw for themselves the attractiveness of Alpine destinations and that maybe the children will say, “We want to come back here!” It’s a big opportunity for Alpine tourism, but we also tend to forget quickly. That said, it’s true that this crisis has been significant. The whole world is more or less terribly affected in nearly every aspect of life. So it could be that certain behaviours will change for good. What research questions are being now analysed in the tourism sector? The most urgent question is to figure out what the winter season will be like and what we can do to make it a good one. We are in close contact with those managing the sector and with tourist destinations. The current trend seems to suggest that people are hesitating a bit over bookings for the winter. People are waiting to see what happens. This behaviour is perfectly human and completely understandable. What other changes have you observed as a result of Covid-19? One issue that will preoccupy us a lot in the future is the change in workplace behaviours, especially in terms of remote working. On the one hand, this should lead to a change in the office-space real-estate market and have an impact on urban centres. On the other hand, people could also go live and work in more remote rural areas without having to commute. Coming back to tourism, the question is to find out whether there is an opportunity for tourist destinations and whether new tourism products and solutions can be developed. If people no longer need to be in a particular place for work purposes, then many might want to move closer to nature and the countryside. So in the mid-to-long term, there is a possibility to strengthen tourist destinations and rural regions that are more structurally weak. But we are just at the beginning. Do you think the coronavirus crisis will have long-term effects on tourism? Yes, on the one hand, it will have an effect on companies that operate on a very small equity base. But right now we still don’t know enough about how the economic situation in Europe will evolve and the impact of the pandemic on the unemployment rate in the main tourist markets. A rise in unemployment is one of the main threats to tourism, and not just in Switzerland.
2020-10-20;Swiss NGOs and cities demand Lesbos camp victim action;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-ngos-and-cities-demand-lesbos-camp-victim-action/46025320;Thousands of migrants were left without shelter after fires gutted their overcrowded camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. This has prompted calls for emergency support and to relocate the victims – including in Switzerland. The true extent of the devastating fires that gutted the Moria refugee camp on Tuesday night was only visible the following morning. The camp has been reduced to a mass of smouldering steel and melted tent tarpaulins, and the 12,500 residents are now mostly homeless. “Around 80% of the camp has burned down,” said Nicolas Perrenoud, who works for the Swiss NGO One Happy Family OHFExternal link and lives on the island. But the aid worker said he was not surprised. “This disaster has been in the air for a while,” he told swissinfo.ch. Tensions had been rising at the site in recent months. The overcrowded camp had been in lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic since March and measures had been steadily tightened. “Since the first coronavirus cases last week the camp has been practically sealed off. Even basic services were stopped, and only medical emergencies were dealt with,” said Perrenoud. But since no proper quarantine zones were set up, fear and uncertainty spread throughout the camp, he said. This led to anger, a number of strikes and demonstrations over the past few days. The fires on Tuesday night were the culmination of what has been a gradual escalation. Blazes were started in the camp, strong winds fuelled the spread of the fire, and firefighters could do little to prevent it. On Wednesday morning, the Greek government declared the island a state of emergency and sent additional units of riot police from Athens. There were reports of thousands of migrants stranded without shelter on the island, and the government said it would take days to find housing for all of them. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters on Thursday that the inferno was started by asylum seekers reacting to quarantine measures after Covid-19 infections were detected. But he did not provide evidence. Meanwhile, in recent months there had been reports of rightwing extremists attacking people from the camp as well as NGO employees, and also of starting fires. The disaster has led to various reactions in Switzerland. “We need a coordinated European action,” Swiss Social Democrat parliamentarian Fabian Molina told swissinfo.ch. “Of course, the immediate suffering has to be alleviated, many people no longer have a roof over their heads.” The refugee situation was already untenable, he added. As a Dublin member state, Switzerland is committed to a common European refugee policy and therefore should take in people from Moria immediately, said Molina. Among the announced measures, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, wrote on Twitter on Thursday that the Commission would finance the immediate transfer and accommodation on the mainland of 400 unaccompanied children and teenagers. “There are no rational reasons why Switzerland should not accept refugees. If not now, then when?” Molina declared. Rebuilding the camp and waiting for the next disaster are not the answers, he added. Eight Swiss cities, including Bern, Zurich and Lucerne, say they stand ready to take in people from the camp and are pushing the federal government to act. NGOs such as Amnesty International have also called forExternal link “quick and pragmatic solutions” to evacuate and assist people affected from Moria. On Thursday, 300 people gathered in Bern to call for action to help the migrants on Lesbos. “The fact that this has not happened yet is ultimately due to a blockade by the Federal Council,” said Molina. He feels this situation, which has been going on for years, undermines solidarity with refugees and casts a shadow over Switzerland’s humanitarian tradition. The Swiss parliamentarian has already been to Lesbos twice and has seen the situation in and around the camp with his own eyes. “Even without the coronavirus, conditions there were inhumane. Now we are facing a humanitarian catastrophe,” he declared, adding that nobody can now claim they didn’t know what was going on. Other members of parliament also intend to increase the pressure on the Federal Council over this issue. Green parliamentarian Balthasar Glättli on Thursday tweeted a proposal urging the Swiss authorities to welcome a “large contingent of refugees” from the devastated Moria camp. The question of refugees is already on the agenda of the current autumn parliamentary session. A motionExternal link has been tabled for the admission of refugees from Greece. It also urges the Federal Council to work at the European level to reform the Dublin Agreement. The House of Representatives already accepted the motion with a large majority in the summer session. Now the Senate will give its say. But there are not expected to be many surprises. The Federal Council has recommended that the motion be adopted. Switzerland has been making considerable efforts in this area. Over the past few months, dozens of children and young migrants who were stranded in Greece with relatives in Switzerland have been flown in. A parliamentary commission has also taken a position on unaccompanied minors: “Switzerland should make greater efforts to accept a larger contingent,” it recently declared. Swiss Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told public broadcaster SRF that Switzerland had sent aid to Lesbos in the shape of emergency shelter and medicines. She added that Switzerland might be prepared to accept unaccompanied minors from Greece but said that there is no legal basis for individual cities taking on refugees.
2020-10-20;Pandemic speeds up push to digital as bank branches close;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-speeds-up-push-to-digital-as-bank-branches-close/46024248;Swiss lender Credit Suisse is set to launch an overhaul of its digital banking offering, as it uses the coronavirus crisis as a springboard to accelerate the push from bricks-and-mortar branches to online services. Last month the bank confirmed plans to close a quarter of its 146 domestic branches by the end of the year. This would lead to SFr100m ($108m) of savings a year by 2022, some of which will be invested in digitisation. Online banking has grown 40 per cent at the Swiss lender in the past two years, while mobile banking has more than doubled. The number of visits to branches has been declining for years. “The Covid-19 crisis has further accelerated these trends,” Credit Suisse reported in a recent statement. Credit Suisse’s new digital offering, due to be unveiled later this month, will combine “the flexibility and cost benefits of a digital bank with the range of products and services” that it offers through its physical branches. It is not alone in spotting an opportunity to hasten the move away from traditional branches and towards online banking. Banks have long talked about reducing their high street outlets to cut costs. Progress has been slow, however, not least because many customers are still fond of branches. But as banks were forced to close large numbers of branches throughout the lockdown, customers adapted to online banking at a rate few lenders expected. Many retail-focused banks closed around a quarter of their branches throughout the second quarter, with a handful making even more drastic cuts. Commerzbank of Germany, for example, had just 20 per cent of its branches open, while BBVA of Spain had 30 per cent open. Most of the branches have since reopened, though Commerzbank has announced that 200 of its 1,000 branches will remain closed permanently. As a result of the closures, banks across the board saw a spike in online activity. At Bank of America, 47 per cent cent of second quarter sales came through digital channels, compared to 29 per cent in the same period over the past two years. Older clients, many of whom had — until this year — been wary of mobile banking, have embraced it as an alternative to visiting branches and putting themselves at risk of catching the virus. One technology trend that has accelerated this year is the uptake of end-to-end digital processing, which has set up bank systems to do away with in-person interaction entirely. A recent survey of banks by Autonomous, a research group, showed many had invested in their client onboarding and contract closing systems, especially when it came to digital identification verification. Three-quarters of banks polled said they were now able to offer mortgages or loans to small-and-medium-sized companies without personally interacting with the customer. Just 8 per cent said they still required customers to come into branches for these products. “Banks are unlikely to be faced with a bigger real-life experiment in the enforced use of digitalisation than Covid-19,” said Stuart Graham, co-founder of Autonomous. “As bank managements sit down in the autumn to review their multiyear planning, we believe they should be taking a much harder look at their cost bases. We believe it is finally ‘show me’ time on the digital cost cutting story,” he added. Even so, bank managers looking to replace bricks-and-mortar branches with mobile apps will still need to make sure they are not seen to be acting too hastily by politicians and regulators. Over the summer, Brian Brooks, acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a US federal banking regulator, told the FT that banks should not use the upheaval caused by coronavirus to shut branches en masse. “I think the idea of, ‘we’ll just go ahead and let branches abandon our cities’ — I think we’d regret that on the back end of this,” he said. The pandemic, he said, was a “one-time event that . . . has affected a relatively small sliver of society compared to the number of people who depend on financial services and branches”.

2020-09-20;Are paid interns a sign of change at the WHO?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/are-paid-interns-a-sign-of-change-at-the-who-/46012500;The embattled World Health Organization has promised more diversity in its Geneva internships and this year started paying young interns for the first time. But internships in Geneva, one of the most expensive cities in the world, have now been suspended amid the coronavirus crisis, and after a row over whether the cash-strapped WHO should pay interns for working online from developing countries. “As part of WHO’s transformation, we have been overhauling the internship programme to increase the diversity of our interns and make it possible for more young people from more countries, especially low- and middle-income ones, to get a chance,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the global health body’s chief, told a press briefing in June. “We are committed to investing in young health leaders who will build a healthier, safer and fairer world.” Pressure to pay interns had long been mounting at the United Nations and international organisations in Geneva, particularly after media reports about an intern who was living in a tent – a story that later appeared to be a media stunt – brought attention to conditions for the young workers and how the lack of pay may have favoured applicants from wealthier countries. In recent years, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia sent the most interns to the global health body, with only a quarter of those chosen coming from low-income countries. The WHO normally accepts around 1,200 interns annually in its Geneva headquarters and field offices. Those numbers, however, dropped sharply in 2020. WHO told swissinfo.ch that there were 32 interns representing 25 nationalities in Geneva before a lockdown was implemented in March in Switzerland due to the pandemic. Unable to expand budgets and recruit staff, the UN and its organisations have increasingly used young graduates who are willing to work for free or low pay for two to six months to gain valuable professional experience. Around 80% of UN internships are unpaid, according to the Fair Internship InitiativeExternal link (FII), an advocacy platform of interns and young professionals leading efforts to reform UN internship schemes.  The UN strategy towards interns remains piecemeal. In the absence of a shared protocol, several UN agencies have tried to improve their own internship policies. Just days before member states adopted a resolutionExternal link in 2018 requiring that 50 percent of interns be selected from developing countries by 2022, Tedros said stipends and health insurance would be offered to WHO interns no later than 2020. The WHO was the first international organisation to adopt a resolution on internships advanced by member states. Albert Barseghyan, the spokesperson for the FII, told swissinfo.ch that the WHO chief faced a reputational threat had he not introduced compensation for the interns. “There were reputational risks that he tried to mitigate just before the World Health Assembly. He knew that there was going to be a resolution regarding internships, and during discussions they could have said ‘oh look, WHO is not paying health insurance for its own interns’. I think that it could have put Dr Tedros in a difficult situation,” he said. Sushan Kharel, a Nepalese national, was one of the first interns this year to benefit from the new internship programme. He received CHF1,800 ($1,960) per month, health insurance and lunch vouchers at the WHO cafeteria, which he said was “very good to live in Geneva. I could live well.” He stayed at a student residence in the centre of town. After initial training he received when he began in January, he worked in the finance department on two projects on his own, and then later in human resources. The work, he said, was comparable to that of staff peers. His internship, which should have been completed in June at the end of a six-month term, was prolonged until August, as flights back to Nepal were suspended due to Covid-19. From March he had to work remotely due to social distancing requirements. “Working for WHO at those times was amazing because you were right in the action” as the organisation declared Covid-19 a pandemic, he said. The young intern attended virtual events with the director general when he spoke to delegates about how to respond to the virus. “It was a very nice learning experience,” he said. Barseghyan said that the WHO had intended to suspend stipends for interns who chose to work remotely from their home countries after it became clear that travel would be complicated due to closed borders. “The (WHO’s) idea was that stipends were there to cover living costs in expensive stations. This kind of reasoning opens up ways to justify unpaid internships,” he said. He said this approach may create new forms of pay abuse for the interns as “in any place in the world, in order to live, you need to work, and if you are remote working for six months, who is going to feed you?” But Kharel, who was also president of the interns’ board, said after the group had expressed their opposition to unpaid remote internships to the director general, the idea of remote work agreements was scrapped. The WHO has subsequently suspended all internships until 2021, although it remains unclear exactly why. The organisation’s spokesperson confirmed that there were no interns currently at the Swiss headquarters and that “interns are not working from their home countries.” This comes in the context of a major funding crisis for the WHO, which is in the eye of the Covid storm. The Trump administration announced at the end of May it was withdrawing from the health body, accusing it of mismanaging the spread of the coronavirus and pandering to China. The US has been the WHO’s largest contributor, providing in financial year 2018-2019 a total of $893 million, of which $656 million were voluntary contributions, earmarked for particular projects. The FII spokesperson expressed concern that the looming economic crisis may create an even greater reliance on low-paid interns. After the global financial crisis in 2008, he said, the number of interns hired by UN agencies “skyrocketed.” “After the current health crisis and economic crisis, we may see the numbers of interns go up again,” said Barseghyan. But WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris rejected the notion that the organisation may want to rely on interns as cheap labour. “The work that we do is highly technical. The bulk of the work could not be done by someone just coming in, who needs a lot of supervision and support.”
2020-08-20;Big companies get ready for a contentious political season;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/big-companies-get-ready-for-a-contentious-political-season/46019732;Our analysis of what the biggest global companies in Switzerland are up to. This week: companies mixed up in politics and foreign aid, plus deforestation and deals with China. Chief executives at the big multinationals usually try to stay on the political sidelines and leave the lobbying to the lobbyists. But it isn’t always easy when the stakes are high. In a few weeks, the Swiss will go to the polls (or mail in their ballots) in the latest display of Swiss direct democracy. There are plenty of vote issues stirring debate in the country including a fighter jet deal, paternity leave and changes to the hunting law. What’s creating the most unease among multinationals though is an initiative brought by the right-wing Swiss People’s Party to curb immigration across Swiss borders, otherwise known as the free movement of people principle at the heart of the European Union. The vote is far from simply symbolic as it could have huge ramifications for non-member Switzerland’s relationship with the EU. For big multinationals in Switzerland, foreign talent is so important that it isn’t surprising that some have broken from their media rulebooks to offer some viewsExternal link on the subject. Not every company is ready to go as far as IKEA Switzerland, which has created an IKEA-branded instruction manualExternal link on how to vote in support of another Swiss vote issue - paternity leave - on September 27. Swiss companies still face less public pressure to speak out on politically sensitive issues than their American or British peers. But that doesn’t mean CEOs here get a free pass. This is especially true when it comes to the Responsible Business Initiative, which will be on the next Swiss ballot in November. In an interview in the German-language paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan was asked his views on the subject, to which he replied that the pharma company stands behind the spirit of the initiativeExternal link but is concerned about implementation. A Nestlé spokesperson also told a group of reporters on Friday that everyone agrees on the need to respect human rights. But the Swiss multinational was against the initiativeExternal link as it stands, arguing it would make companies more risk averse to the point that they might stop investing in certain countries. This doesn’t even touch on what’s at stake in the presidential election in the US. For big companies, there’s no escape from politics in Switzerland or anywhere else this autumn. Cautionary tales abound when it comes to mixing business and foreign aid. The Swiss government says it wants to “fully harness the potential of the private sector” in its work in poorer countries. It isn’t alone, but experience from other donor countries shows the Swiss government should tread carefully when working with big business on development projects. Roche stays in the corona race with new diagnostic tests. Despite disappointing results for its drug Actemra as a Covid-19 treatment, Roche is still grabbing headlines thanks to news that it is launching a rapid antigen test for current coronavirus infections and another that differentiates between influenza and coronavirus. What happens now? That’s the question on the minds of many school principals, airline CEOs, and employers. SWISS International Air Lines just announced a deal with Swiss start-up ender diagnosticsExternal link to use its rapid coronavirus test for long-haul cabin crew. Could more such deals be in the works? More demands on the Swiss government to renegotiate a trade deal with China. The Society of Threatened Peoples and Campax, in a letter backed with more than 20,000 signatures, argues the government isn’t doing enough to prevent forced labour and that the six-year-old trade deal with China should include binding clauses to respect human rights. This comes amid reports that one million Uighurs are being held in internment camps in Xinjiang province in northwest China and are forced to work in factories on behalf of well-known international brands. Nestlé’s investment to address cocoa-related deforestation could backfire. Those familiar with the region explained that plans to compensate illegal cocoa farmers to stop cutting down the forest in Ivory Coast could actually incentivise more illegal cocoa production. 
2020-08-20;How did Covid-19 impact Swiss education?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-did-covid-19-impact-swiss-education-/46018790;"Switzerland had some advantages when dealing with school shutdowns during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and vocational training remains strong, says the OECD’s latest global education research. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released its Education at a GlanceExternal link 2020 report on Tuesday, comparing education systems in 46 countries. This year’s edition looks at the state of vocational training, but also heavily focused on the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. During the height of the pandemic, schools shut down across the world with students turning to remote learning to plug the gap. “Switzerland had experienced – depending on the canton - up to 13 weeks of (effective) school closures in some form, compared to 14 weeks on average across OECD countries,” the report’s county notes for Switzerland stated.In Switzerland schools closed nationwide on March 16 – an unprecedented step by the government as cantons are usually in charge of educational matters. They reopened progressively from May 11, with younger pupils going back first. The closure period also included a previously scheduled spring break, which may have made the impact less severe, the OECD report pointed out. By looking at average school hours last year in Switzerland - 797 hours of classes per year at primary level (up to age 12) and 945 hours at lower secondary level (up to age 15/16) in Swiss schools - OECD researchers were able to calculate how much instruction time was lost during the lockdown: around 21 hours of compulsory instruction time at primary level and 25 hours at lower secondary level for each week of the closure. School reopenings have hinged greatly on maintaining a safe distance of one to two metres between pupils and staff, the OECD said.  “Countries with smaller class sizes may find it easier to comply with new restrictions on social distancing. In Switzerland, the average class size at primary level is 19 students in public institutions, which is smaller than the OECD average of 21.” The report also considered higher education; Swiss universities will shortly re-open for students for the autumn semester. Research could carry on in a limited capacity during the lockdown. But this year’s student body will be quite different from previous years, with fewer international students. The OECD report concludes that this decreased “internationalisation” could be one of the main impacts of the pandemic on Swiss universities. “Switzerland, with a higher share of international students than in total across the OECD, may be more strongly affected than other countries,” it said. About 30% of students at Swiss universities come from abroad, according to the latest available statistics.  They made up 56% of those doing a PhD in 2019/2020 – compared to an OECD average of 25%. Globally, vocational education and training (VET) was also hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, said the OECD, as business closures made work-based learning for apprentices more difficult. In May, the Swiss government created a special taskforce to help young people find apprenticeships amid the pandemic. Yet this sector is crucial for ensuring that education and work are aligned, and for employment and economic recovery, said an editorial accompanying the report. Furthermore, “many of the professions that formed the backbone of economic and social life during the lockdown hinge on vocational qualifications,” it pointed out. In Switzerland, 64% of students older than 15 go into apprenticeships, while others attend a school that prepares them for university or take a gap year if they struggle to find training. “Switzerland is among the OECD countries with a strong vocational system,” the report found, linking this strength to the country’s high degree of reliance on work-study programmes. Some 90% of Switzerland’s upper secondary vocational students are enrolled in combined school- and work-based programmes, compared to 34% on average across OECD countries, according to the OECD’s Paris Directorate. “Adults with vocational education also have good learning outcomes. Switzerland is among the few OECD countries where the completion rate of upper secondary level is higher for students in vocational programmes than in general ones,” the Directorate said."
2020-07-20;Virologist calls for more tests, masks for children;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/virologist-calls-for-more-tests--masks-for-children/46017328;"Geneva virologist Isabella Eckerle has called for more testing and obligatory mask wearing for younger children at school as the number of classes in quarantine over coronavirus rises. Last week two classes in canton Aargau in northern Switzerland were sent home after three pupils tested positive for the coronavirus and two primary classes in canton Geneva were also put into quarantine. It has emerged that 46 pupils have tested positive in canton Zurich since term began three weeks ago, with 254 in quarantine. Experts have been questioning the role of children in passing the virus on. Currently the Swiss authorities do not consider the under-12s to be drivers of the pandemic and they are not routinely tested. The problem is that there are not many studies on children and the coronavirus, Eckerle, a professor at the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper on SundayExternal link. She says we shouldn’t assume that children are not in the risk group. We know that when children are infected their virus load is just as high as that of adults, she said. “One should test [children] as much as adults. This is the only way that we can find out which measures are helpful to keep the infection numbers down, so that we can successfully get through the winter,” Eckerle said. The professor said she was in favour of pupils wearing masks in primary schools (these schools are exempt at the moment; the rule only applies to some upper secondary schools and this depends on the canton as cantons are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland). But this should go hand in hand with other measures such as smaller classes, a mix of in-class teaching and remote learning as well as good ventilation. Some schools could be designated “research schools” where you could carry out spot checks to see which measures were working best, she said. Eckerle’s comments in the NZZ am Sonntag come shortly after she tweeted her views on the issue. The thread also said that Switzerland was “not well prepared because prevention measures varied between cantons and schools” and that there was “no national strategy or guidance & worst, inconsistent testing of children under 12. We need a national strategy based on scientific data, accompanied by scientific studies”.  Eckerle has support from Bern epidemiologist Christian Althaus, who told the NZZ am Sonntag that it seemed that children became infected less often and tended to transmit the virus less than adults. “But so long as we don’t pay attention and do tests, we’ll only see a few cases. It would make sense to test children if possible,” he said. There are signs however that the federal health authorities are reassessing their current guidelines, the newspaper reported. “The Federal Office of Public Health is currently, along with children’s doctors, looking into the question of testing children. This is particularly due to autumn coming up,” it wrote."
2020-07-20;Switzerland is not an island;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-is-not-an-island/46002310;"As Switzerland prepares to vote on September 27 – once again – on whether it should barricade itself off from the world, my thoughts turn to what I consider quintessentially Swiss. It is not the local costumes, dialects and deep valleys, but mountaintops, pragmatism and hospitality. Or perhaps what is quintessentially Swiss is to weld these six into a vibrant, healthy economy and one of the few truly democratic systems of government. A tiny country with four languages and 26 primary and secondary school systems: how can it support two of the top universities in the world – one that is ranked second best in Europe? How could it have been named – in 2019 – the world’s most innovative country? We have the second highest GDP per capita among European countries, excellent health care and a fantastic quality of life. On what does such success depend? I will argue – surprisingly – that it is openness. Switzerland has been pragmatic and careful, but open. There is no other way for a country in the middle of Europe – one with basically no natural resources – to survive, much less thrive. And through its openness Switzerland has reinforced what it means to be Swiss. Our way of life, our modern post-industrial world, is inextricably linked to technology. And driving technological breakthroughs is scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge itself is an ever-evolving, ever-growing fundament that depends almost entirely – despite computers – on curiosity and human brains. Moreover, it is global. There is not a different calculus and chemistry in Siberia or Brazil, our basic mathematical and scientific concepts are universal. Since they evolve continually, either one is at the forefront of knowledge, and has the means to address problems facing society (for instance, global warming or a pandemic) or not. Ultimately, finding solutions to problems facing our society is the source of economic success. Some call that innovation, which has put us where we now are. Yet, how can a country with 0.1% of the world’s population hope to lead in innovation and secure economic success? My answer is, through excellence and “openness”. Below I explain what “openness” means for science: Science is global. There is no scientist today that does not depend daily on a flow of information and a constant dialogue with other scientists around the world. Breakthroughs do not arise in ivory towers, but from a continual exchange of ideas, techniques, reagents and results, that lead us to new discoveries. Discoveries of how coronavirus enters cells, for example. Discoveries of how we can soften the cytokine storm that the virus provokes, or how we might detect and prevent pandemics in the future. Science thrives where funding is sufficient and life is secure enough that we can focus on the unknown. But that is not enough, science relies on open exchange. Switzerland has always ensured this (Basel for the last 560 years), and it has yielded fruit. Why are world-leading pharmaceutical companies in Switzerland? Because years ago necessary innovations – many coming from elsewhere – were implemented successfully here. Will this continue to happen in the future? Only if we leave the door open for a continuous exchange of scientists and ideas. Collaboration is the life-blood of science. Today we know things as soon as they happen, and we have to know who is doing what ahead of publication to be able to follow developments productively. People in research come and go continuously, and Swiss laboratories live from foreign students and postdocs who come for a few years, bringing with them energy and drive. They move on, but they stay in contact and the network rapidly becomes global. In this way, Switzerland is intricately woven into the fabric of scientific discovery that spans the globe. It is not only the know-how that we get from elsewhere, but the people we attract, that are essential to our success. A friend of mine just published in Nature on a virally encoded protease that is crucial for Covid-19 propagation – an excellent target for blocking the disease. They only started studying this last spring, yet achieved amazing insights in just a few months. He wrote this about it, “The secret lay in sharing info and in collaborations with amazing scientists. Cross-border European collaboration and a culture of openness have brought some new discoveries, but equally important, it has fostered a sense of purpose, inspiration, and togetherness among our students and postdocs, showing that science is an incredibly rewarding and important profession.” If Swiss labs cannot participate in forefront European collaborations, and readily attract students and postdocs from abroad, Swiss productivity in science and technology will decline, and our economy will suffer. It is as simple as that: scientific innovation requires an open atmosphere of exchange supported by governmental policies. An inhospitable country destroys its own competitive edge. Switzerland has very few natural resources, and as a result our economy depends largely on its human resources. That is, on grey-matter: brains and innovative thinking. And technology moves forward quickly; one must be always at the forefront, or one is rapidly left behind. Nowadays very few major problems can be solved by one person or with one technology. To have networks and connections means that one has a chance to contribute to an important new discovery by teaming up with others. Without this, one is quickly forgotten and the rest of the world moves on. We note that Switzerland does not produce enough young talent to meet the needs of our laboratories, yet our society counts on our scientific successes. Thus, we must remain open to exchange, importing (and exporting) not only students, postdocs and trainees, but also engineers and professors. Here’s where Swiss hospitality actually pays off – despite common misperceptions – Swiss universities have always attracted and hosted non-Swiss. Recent numbers show that about 50% of the professorial staff at University of Zurich are non-Swiss. In fact, some of our most famous thinkers were not natives! This kind of openness has yielded the highest dividends for our country – for centuries. Competition elevates dreams and goals beyond what one might have originally thought possible. For the last 30 years Switzerland has negotiated the right to participate in the European Union’s Framework programs for research funding. Until 2004, our rights to participate were quite limited, but thereafter, in Framework Programs 6 and 7 and Euratom, Switzerland was an associated member, with all of the rights and obligations that came with that status. Then came the Horizon 2020 package with its Excellence in Science pillar, which funds the best and most creative scientists of Europe with generous 5-year grants. It almost passed us by due to the 2014 vote on the mass immigration initiative and our failure to sign the Croatia Protocol. Fortunately for Switzerland, our government managed to negotiate a partial participation, and scientists across all Swiss universities and institutes, succeeded in capturing many of the highly prized European Research Council (ERC) grants. The Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel has the highest success rate of all research institutes of Europe for these prestigious grants. And now, with another vote on immigration facing us, we risk being cut off from the most competitive and most lucrative funding available to creative scientists across Europe. Does cutting ourselves off matter? What if Switzerland just distributed to its own scientists the money earmarked to “buy” us into the new Horizon Europe program? Wouldn’t that be better? Not at all – we would be like a wealthy small-town football team that pays its players well, but which cannot attract the best coaches and never gets to play in the big league. How is their football? Definitely not good. Competition itself, even the effort required to apply for one of the ERC grants, raises the quality of Swiss science, and attracts the best of young upcoming scientists to Switzerland. This reflects human nature: the ability to compete among a pool from 450 million rather than 8 million people, immediately raises the stakes, one aims higher and reaches new heights. This is the “mountain top” aspect of Switzerland: we want to see further, aim higher, climb faster, and we should if we can. But only by participating in Europe-wide competition can we hope to reach that level in science. The review process is tougher, the demands are higher and one must try harder. In return, by participating in the review boards, Swiss scientists are better recognized, more highly appreciated and better networked with their peers. Without European science, Swiss science would be a mere shadow of what it aspires to be. So, the question of whether Switzerland will be able to negotiate full association for the Horizon Europe program hangs in the air as the Swiss go to the urns again in September to vote on “une immigration moderée”. What does that mean? To “moderate immigration” means to go beyond what is considered acceptable by our European neighbours. I appreciate the desire of the Swiss to decide for themselves, but the loss of international connectedness, the compromising of our current leadership in science and technology, and the isolationism that will ensue, are far too high a price to pay. Will we lose our “identity as Switzerland” if we maintain an open policy towards foreigners? Not in the least. Since the birth of modern Switzerland, four language and culture groups have openly agreed to share common standards, without losing their identities. Our agreement to be open across the 26 cantons has reinforced our differences, in a positive way. In brief, Switzerland is not an island and it must never think like one. Only by networking fully with our European neighbours and the world in general, will we be able to maintain the standards we proudly hail as “Swiss”. Let’s think mountain tops, pragmatism and hospitality, by recognizing how intricately our modern life is woven into the tapestry of Europe. Only then will we be able to maintain the life that we so keenly want to protect.

2020-07-20;Switzerland takes Belgium and Mexico off Covid-19 ‘high risk’ list;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-takes-belgium-and-mexico-off-covid-19--high-risk--list/46017140;People arriving in Switzerland from Belgium, Mexico and Luxembourg will no longer have to go into quarantine for ten days. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) on Monday updated its listExternal link of countries deemed to have a high risk of coronavirus infection and removed Belgium, Mexico, Luxembourg, El Salvador, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Oman. But it added Croatia, French Polynesia, Guyana, Lebanon, Libya, Paraguay, San Marino, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates to the list of 55 high-risk countries. Under Swiss regulations, anyone entering Switzerland from one of the countries on the new list has to go into quarantine for ten days to help curb the spread of Covid-19, or risk a fine. Under the current Covid-19 measures travel remains possible between Switzerland and most other countries of the European Union, EFTA, and the UK. However, due to a rise in infections travellers from Switzerland to the UK must go into quarantine for 14 days. Those travelling from most non-Schengen countries can only enter Switzerland in exceptional cases. The Swiss authorities have created a listExternal link of 19 safe non-Schengen countries not affected by this ban. Since mid-April Switzerland has witnessed a slow increase in new coronavirus cases to a seven-day average of 324 a day. However, the daily numbers fluctuate. On September 4, 405 cases were registered in Switzerland and Liechtenstein over the previous 24 hours, while on September 7, there were 191 new cases. Despite the recent increase, Stefan Kuster, the head of communicable diseases at FOPH, said last week that he was not worried. The situation was also stable in terms of hospitalisations and deaths, he said: “At the moment we’re not talking of a second wave. We’re talking of a slow increase in infections. The efforts of the population and the cantons are bearing fruit.”
2020-07-20;Why voting by mail is rarely easy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/why-voting-by-mail-is-rarely-easy/46016512;Faced with having to go to crowded polling stations during a pandemic, voters – and political campaigns – are increasingly turning to postal ballots. But the cases of the United States, Poland and Switzerland show that introducing and maintaining this way of voting is full of potential pitfalls. As an eligible Norwegian citizen taking part in a popular vote, you need a piece of paper, three envelopes and a valid stamp. On the white paper you write down your choice (name of party or candidate, yes or no in a referendum), mark the first envelope as the “voting” envelope, add some personal information (name, date of birth, address) on the second one and finally address the third to the election commission of  your registered home municipality. Layer the envelopes, apply the stamp and put it in the post – that’s it. While the Norwegian way of postal voting is probably the most liberal in the world, it is far from the only one on offer. More than 50 countries allow remote voting in elections and referendums. This was the case even before the Covid-19 pandemic, which made remote voting almost a necessity for a safe procedure. As a result of the pandemic “at least 70 countries have postponed their scheduled public votes”, says Nana Kalandadze at International IDEA, an intergovernmental democracy support agency which monitors elections and referendums around the world. In addition to safety concerns over the voting process itself, many of the places that cancelled votes cited the inability to carry out campaigning or public debates as reasons for their decisions. But at least 56 countries did hold votes despite the pandemic – often through hastily arranged postal voting schemes. “Some countries are now trying to quickly introduce some form of mail-in voting, but such moves are full of obstacles and pitfalls,” Kalandadze says. In the United States, postal or absentee voting goes back to the 1880s and is now available to 83% of American voters across all states. Twenty of the 50 US states have made it easier to vote remotely in this year’s presidential election because of the pandemic.   According to ERIC, a non-governmental election watchdog, the rate of possible cases of voter fraud – such as double voting or voting on behalf of a deceased person – has been 0.0025%, or 376 ballots out of 14.6 million ballots cast by post in the US. But the pandemic has triggered a hyper-partisan debate over postal voting driven by the sitting president, Donald Trump, and the ruling Republican party.  Trump tweeted in July that “The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, & everyone knows it”. It’s one of more than 70 attacks he has made against voting by mail since March. With his crusade against mail-in voting, Trump is “complicating Republican turnout efforts in numerous key states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Iowa,” says Amy Gardner, a national political reporter at the Washington Post. That’s because many older voters, who tend to vote Republican, are unlikely to want to go to the polls in person as the coronavirus continues to spread. Joe Mathews, a Los Angeles-based democracy correspondent, believes that by questioning postal voting, “the president wants to undercut the electoral process as such by laying the groundwork to claim that the election was rigged if he loses in November”. Postal voting also became a bitterly partisan issue in Poland, which had no postal-voting rules at all until recently. As the pandemic’s first big wave hit in April, the Polish government was eager to see President Andrzej Duda (from the ruling populist Law and Justice Party) re-elected. It decided to go ahead with its presidential election on May 10, but the lockdown and a ban on large indoor gatherings made in-person voting impossible. So the government tried to fast-track a new electoral law allowing all-postal voting. “Basically everything was done wrong,” says Magdalena Musial-Karg, professor of political science at Poland’s Adam Mickiewicz University. Eager to secure victory in a contentious election, the government tried to bypass the National Election Commission in launching the postal vote, she adds. Such a change during an ongoing election process is prohibited by European Union law, and the Polish postal service tasked with delivering the ballot papers lacked the addresses of millions of eligible voters. In the end, the May 10 ballot was postponed at the last minute through intervention by the National Election Commission. It was rescheduled for two rounds of votes in June and July, when Duda claimed a narrow victory over his challenger, Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Musial-Karg and a colleague recently published an accountExternal link of Poland’s partisan attempt to fast-track postal voting, in which they noted that “it took Switzerland 30 years to test and develop postal voting, whereas Poland tried to do it in just two months”. Indeed, Switzerland offers the most extensive record of postal voting in the world, because its citizens vote multiple times a year in regular referendums. But the Swiss tradition of voting by mail is much younger than that of the US: it dates to the years following the introduction of universal voting rights for women in the 1970s. “At first only sick people were allowed by law to mail in their votes,” recalls Hans-Urs Wili, who led the political rights section at the Federal Chancellery for many decades. But in the 1990s a parliamentary initiative opened the door to a much more liberalised postal voting operation. Today, more than 80% of all ballots in elections and referendums are sent by mail, according to the Swiss Post. During his tenure as justice minister, right-wing icon and former Swiss People’s Party leader Christoph Blocher repeatedly claimed to the Chancellery that postal voting was “wildly faked”. In 2006, he ordered the government to send out a federal circular to all cantons mandating a series of precautionary measures. For example, all postal vote envelopes had to have the disclaimer: “Anyone who does not want to exercise their voting rights must tear up their voting card before disposing of it! . However, the cantons were ultimately able to show that the allegations of fraud were unfounded, and the federal order became non-binding a year later. But its withdrawal was never officially communicated to the public. Wili says the introduction of postal voting has contributed to an increased average voter turnout of 15% nationwide and has doubled turnout in canton Geneva.    As in the United States, voter fraud is extremely rare in Switzerland: in more than 40 years of regular ballots, officials have registered just five attempts to manipulate the vote on a local level. And as in the US and many places around the world, the conversation about the best way to vote continues – most recently over the issue of electronic voting, a new frontier in the quest to cast ballots in safety, in secret and without manipulation.
2020-07-20;Covid-19 measures mark parliamentary session;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-measures-mark-parliamentary-session/46016548;The autumn parliamentary session is underway in Bern, with new plexiglass dividers in place and pandemic-related legislation up for debate. In order to protect the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, the partitions were installed between the seats of their chambers. Face masks, though not required, are strongly recommended inside the federal parliament. Over the next three weeks the 46 senators and 200 representatives will be handling more business than usual, with additional afternoon discussions, some expected to last into the evening. For example, both chambers will tackle the Covid-19 Act, designed to enshrine emergency law into ordinary law where necessary. Also on the agenda: additional pandemic-related credit of CHF770 million ($842 million) for items such as virus tests, railway infrastructure or air traffic control. Support for football and ice hockey clubs will be discussed as well. A further CHF700 million is earmarked for public transport. The Unemployment Act must also be amended to ensure unemployment aid. Non-coronavirus-related business includes funding for culture, education, research and innovation, as well as legislation related to blockchain, political donations, money laundering and cannabis research. The autumn parliamentary session runs until September 25.
2020-06-20;Swiss labour market shows signs of recovery after Covid-19 slump;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-labour-market-shows-signs-of-recovery-after-covid-19-slump/46015328;A survey of companies and an analysis of advertised posts indicate that the job market is recovering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.   According to an article in the SonntagsZeitung paper on Sunday, the labour market is recovering faster from its April low than experts predicted.   A survey of 18,000 companies conducted by the Federal Statistical Office suggest that Switzerland will fare better than expected. Around 71% of the firms surveyed want to maintain their staffing levels in the third quarter of 2020 and nine percent want to increase them. Only seven percent intend to cut jobs which is lower than during the financial crisis of 2008: at the peak of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, 12% of companies surveyed stated that they intended to cut jobs.  However, not all sectors have weathered the Covid-19 storm equally well. The most pessimistic are watchmakers, machinery manufacturers, the metal refiners, logistics firms, landlords and hoteliers. They want to reduce their workforce by an above-average amount of between 11% and 17%. The sectors least threatened by job cuts include banks, insurers, the health, social and education sectors and public administration.  Another indicator of recovery is the number of newly advertised jobs analysed by the data companies Novalytica and X28. Between June and August - i.e. since the easing of coronavirus restrictions - this has risen by more than 50% from 26,490 to 39,915. However, the number of vacancies is still clearly below last year's level: In August, 15 percent fewer jobs were advertised than in August 2019. 
2020-05-20;Hundreds demonstrate against Swiss coronavirus restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hundreds-demonstrate-against-swiss-coronavirus-restrictions/46014664;Around 350 people took part in a protest march against mandatory anti-Covid 19 measures in the central Swiss canton of Uri   The demonstrators marched on Saturday afternoon from the railway station in Flüelen to the iconic William Tell monument in Altdorf. The participants of the authorised protest were against the compulsory wearing of masks on public transport. The banners they carried criticised the measures taken by the authorities as disproportionate and called for more personal responsibility.   According to the police, the rally was peaceful. However, a large number of participants did not wear face masks and did not observe social distancing rules, the Uri cantonal police reported in a statement.   The participants ignored protective measures despite appeals by the police. The law enforcement authorities intend to file a complaint with the public prosecutor's office for non-compliance with the conditions of the permit to protest peacefully.  Similar protests were held in several Swiss cities in May when there was a nationwide ban on more than five people gathering in public places. Since then restrictions on gatherings have eased. Private and public events of up to 1,000 people have been allowed since June 22, as long as contact tracing can be guaranteed. On August 12, the government announced that events with more than 1,000 people – notably festivals and sporting events – would be allowed against starting on October 1.

The efforts of the population and the cantons are bearing fruit.” Kuster said it is impossible to predict how the situation will develop. “That depends on people returning from abroad, on the effect of the resumption of major events, and on autumn, which could have an influence. Everyone is called upon to prevent a strong resurgence [of cases],” he said. On Wednesday the government announced a series of conditions for the resumption of mass events in Switzerland, which have been limited since March to curb the spread of coronavirus infections.

2020-04-20;As tunnel opens, transport project of the century becomes reality;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/alptransit_ceneri-base-tunnel-gotthard-swiss/46007868;With the inauguration of the Ceneri base tunnel, the finishing touches are being put on the most colossal infrastructure project in recent Swiss history. The Swiss definitely like to burrow. If you were to add up the distance covered by all the longest railway tunnels in the country, it would be enough to travel underground across almost the entire national territory from Chiasso to Basel – several hundred kilometres. In particular, the 56km Gotthard base tunnel, inaugurated with great pomp in 2016, continues to enjoy the title of world’s longest – a title it will hold onto for at least another decade, until the Brenner tunnel links Italy and Austria. Now Switzerland’s collection is about to welcome a new addition: the 15.4-kilometre Mount Ceneri tunnel, where the ribbon is to be cut on September 4 in a scaled-down, Covid-conscious ceremony. For travellers, the change will only become a reality when the national rail timetable changes in December, at which point the tunnel will come into use. Then, due to more coronavirus-linked delays, we will have to wait until April 2021 to see all the connections in place. Compared to the figures for the Gotthard or Lötschberg (34.6km), the Monte Ceneri seems like small fry. But two decades ago, its 15.4km would have put it in the world’s top 10 by length. By the end of this decade, when other projects like the Fréjus or the Brenner are completed, it will be about 30th in the world rankings. The inauguration of the Ceneri is the final step in an engineering adventure that started 30 years ago. Indeed, the Alpine rail link project to upgrade connections between northern and southern Europe – including the Lötschberg, Gotthard and Ceneri tunnels – is a good example of how the Swiss political system can get things done. Because, with all its endless delays and compromises, the Swiss direct democracy system has a significant advantage: once a project has been ratified by voters, it can be implemented without further delay. In contrast to similar projects elsewhere – the Turin-Lyon line, for example, blocked by opposition groups – the Alpine rail link project has never become a target of protests or demonstrations. After voters accepted it with a 63.6% majority in 1992, the project simply proceeded without further ado. Those opposed for financial or environmental reasons, notably the Greens, accepted the verdict of the ballot box without reservation. The opening of the Ceneri tunnel also means a transport revolution for the southern canton of Ticino. Travel time between Bellinzona and Lugano will be cut by a third, from 27 to 19 minutes. From Lugano to Locarno the savings will be even greater, down from 50 to 29 minutes. Furthermore, regional rail lines will be upgraded, and some reckon the change could lead to the creation of a “Ticino City” – one big urban sprawl across the canton. The impact will be significant on international traffic, too. From next year, travellers will be able to get to Milan from Zurich in less than three-and-a-half hours. When other projects are completed, including on the Italian side, this time will drop to 3 hours – that’s 40 minutes less than what it is now. With the opening of the Gotthard base tunnel in 2016, the time taken for the journey was already cut by half an hour. The chart below concerns the Gotthard and not the Ceneri, but gives an impression of how things have changed over a few decades. Reduction of travel time is only one of the goals of the Alpine rail link project. The other, just as important and in fact written into Switzerland’s constitution after the “Alpine initiative” approved by voters in 1994, is to get heavy goods traffic off the road and onto rail. That legislation stipulates that the number of heavy vehicles crossing the Alps annually be reduced from 1.4 million in the year 2000 to 650,000 – an objective that should have been reached two years after the opening of the Gotthard tunnel. However, though the number of heavy vehicles is dropping, the target is still a long way away. The base tunnels are the key component of this strategy. On the one hand, they allow for an increase in the number of tracks devoted to goods trains, and on the other hand, since these lines run on level ground, they allow an increase in the length of trains, from 500m to 740m. The Ceneri tunnel will also helps this: it will enable an upgrade of the line between Chiasso and Milan, giving goods traffic on the north-south corridor an additional outlet – on top of the usual Lötschberg/Simplon and Bellinzona/Luino/Gallarate routes. However, there is no reason to expect a sudden surge in road-to-rail transfer. The new Ceneri tunnel, though a key building-block in the transfer policy, is not a magic wand. For one thing, rail is not the solution for all transport needs. And for another, having tunnels which represent the state of the art in rail technology are of little use without adequate access routes to get to them. With that in mind, a great deal has already been done to bring surrounding infrastructure up to scratch. The so-called 4-metre corridor (in Europe, more and more goods are carried on 4-metre-high trailers, and tunnels have to be modified accordingly) is practically finished. This includes in neighbouring Italy, where large-scale works have taken place between Bellinzona and Gallarate thanks to Swiss contributions. Obstacles remain, particularly on the line between the Ceneri and Milan. South of Lugano, trains will still have to slow down on a line dating from 1874, with nothing likely to change here before 2050External link. Between Chiasso and Milan, meanwhile, investments of several hundred million are planned to increase the capacity of lines. Nevertheless, investment in physical infrastructure like new rails and switches has not been given a firm date. The situation is more complicated in southern Germany, where there have been considerable delays in the project to widen the Rhine Valley stretch to four tracks. Hupac, the biggest European player in inter-modal transport, says that this situation will not now allow for the passage of trains of 740m. The transport revolution might still take a while.

2020-03-20;High gold prices spur more illegal mining in Peru;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/gold-finds-favour-in-the-pandemic-but-at-what-cost-/45987080;The boom in gold prices during the Covid-19 pandemic has kept Swiss refineries in business but has also boosted illegal mining, imperiling lives and the environment.   Increased demand for the safe-haven metal has led gold prices to fluctuate in recent weeks around their highest levels since 2011. Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at the Swiss bank UBS,  recently wrote that the metal has even more room to rally if geopolitical tensions rise. Between March and June, Switzerland, where around 60% of the global supply is refined, sent record volumes of gold to the United States to satisfy demand from investors.   However, with authorities in many gold-producing countries strictly enforcing lockdown measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, the illegal gold mining sector has been flourishing. With some industrial mines out of action, illegal miners are making up the gold shortfall.     In the Peruvian rainforest, just a year after the government sent police and the army to occupy land devastated by miners as part of a crackdown on illegal mining, the situation is concerning. “Criminal organisations are not lowering their presence,” Lucía Dammert, a Peruvian professor specialised in public security at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile, told swissinfo.ch.   “There is an increasing presence of child labour and human trafficking, specifically of women for prostitution,” Dammert added, saying that due to lockdown measures, the economic crisis has further aggravated the situation. In April, the country’s economy contracted by 40% compared to the same month in 2019. Some 72% of the population already relies on the underground economy to make a living and the coronavirus restrictions have driven even more people to seek illegal activities.   Peru is the world’s seventh-largest producer of gold of which an estimated 20% is mined illegally. Over the past 30 years, some 960 square kilometres of rainforest have vanished as people from poor parts of the country have been drawn to areas where the metal is found by the prospect of getting rich. Women often become trapped in a vicious cycle of prostitution, debt and enslavement.    General Raul del Castillo, the country’s environmental police chief, told swissinfo.ch that since the start of the pandemic, the fight against illegal gold mining has not been easy. Public resources have been diverted towards fighting Covid-19. The national police force has been hard hit by the virus, with some 24,000 confirmed cases and approximately 400 fatalities within the state agency. Since mid-July, Madre de Dios, which has been a focal point for illegal gold mining, has recorded the highest rate of infection within the country.   Del Castillo maintained that even with only a third of the capacity his forces had in 2019, the impact of enforcement within the vast, now-barren area of La Pampa in the Madre de Dios region has been positive.   But he said, “Many of the miners in Madre de Dios, due to the presence of law enforcement and the fear of prosecution, migrated to other regions where that presence was not as big  to continue their illicit activities. The general said many had moved to the regions of la Libertad, in the northwest, Arequipa and parts of Cusco not far from Madre de Dios. These include areas where there hasn’t been as much deforestation but where human rights abuses and pollution are rife. Others have set up camps to mine illegally in the so-called Mining Corridor in Madre de Dios, where mining is normally only permitted under certain conditions.   “In view of the potential gains, they continue to work. They are not going to say: `I’m done and I am going home`. They will continue until the presence of the state becomes more important,” he said.   Luis Hidalgo, Madre de Dios’ governor, told the national daily El Comercio, that “informal” traders in the region’s capital Puerto Maldonado have been paying less than half of the usual price, as those options are now more limited.   Del Castillo argued it is important to go after those responsible for buying and laundering the gold, by falsifying documents where the metal may appear as legitimate, “before exporting it to destinations, such as Switzerland, Dubai and China”.    His service was involved in a sting operation earlier this year involving the arrest of members of a mafia network across five regions of Peru and the seizure of 200 kilos of gold destined for Switzerland, Germany, Dubai, India and China. Gold was being mined inside tunnels dug into hills behind structures made to look like houses, in which workers were locked in the shafts overnight.    Gold ingots and bags of soil mixed with a high concentration of the precious metal worth an estimated $10 million were stored near Lima’s international airport to be exported to those countries via legal mining companies registered in Peru. One of those firms, Veta Dorada, told the online news site Mongabay that it “buys gold ore from small formal and artisanal miners duly registered with the Ministry of Energy and Mines”. Peruvian customs data shows that Veta Dorada, a processing plant on the southern Pacific coast, had exported gold to PX Precinox, a refinery in the Swiss city of La-Chaux-de-Fonds. From February to March, those shipments were destined to the refiner via customs in Zurich. Later shipments were registered to be delivered to the company via Miami, a first destination due to limited flights out of Peru since the start of the pandemic, according to the Swiss company. “All the gold that has been exported is legal,” Philippe Chave, CEO of PX Precinox, told swissinfo.ch, regarding the gold his company had imported. “We work only with people who are either formal or registered in the formalisation process”. Del Castillo said investigations are ongoing to uncover more about the foreign links to illegal mining.  
2020-03-20;Bullish Switzerland moves on from lockdown and focuses on economy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bullish-switzerland-moves-on-from-lockdown-and-focuses-on-economy/46009200;Switzerland prides itself on the way it managed to limit the spread of coronavirus within its borders while shielding its economy from the worst ravages of the shutdown. But as economic stimulus packages are wound down across Europe and Covid-19 cases tick up, Bern has signalled it is the economy that must be the priority in the months ahead. In a sign of the wealthy Alpine state’s bullishness, rules of social gatherings will under current plans be relaxed from October to allow groups of more than 1,000 to congregate. Ministers spent the week with representatives of the tourism and hospitality sector discussing how best to boost Switzerland’s important winter holiday season. We were confronted with something we had no clue about,” Effy Vayena, professor of bioethics at ETH Zurich, said of the outbreak of the pandemic and “needed to buy time and figure out what was happening”. Five months on, Swiss public health authorities much better understood the dynamics and “that [lockdowns] are not sustainable”, she said. “There’s been a big shift in focus. What we’re seeing now in Switzerland is people getting used to the idea of living in a risk society. We’re asking: ‘how do we live with this?’” Since Switzerland’s formal state of emergency ended in mid-June it has been left to the 26 individual cantons to set their own rules. They are as sanguine as the federal government. Zurich, the biggest city, introduced compulsory mask wearing in shops only last week, months after other European countries brought in similar legislation. The sensible course was to focus on getting life back to normal — for the economy and society as a whole, Prof Vayena said, adding that, above all, “the Swiss like balance”. For some policymakers in Bern, the whole idea of a trade-off between the economy and public health was a false one. The strategy was never to defeat the virus using public policy tools, said one senior scientific adviser to the government in Bern, but to cope with it. “The important thing is that we can manage the situation. When I look at other countries, maybe they’re less confident that they can,” the adviser said. “Maybe that’s why you’re seeing more border closures and hardline measures being taken and talked about elsewhere.” In every country the pandemic has played out against existing political and social cleavages: Switzerland’s system comprising strong but locally focused communities and a laissez-faire approach from national government has been no exception. Switzerland in March took an early decision to shut down public life but it was also one of the first in Europe to reopen its hospitality sector. Restaurants and bars have been bustling since mid-May while shops have been filled over the summer. Alain Berset, the interior minister, stated late last month that the virus situation in Switzerland was “fragile . . . but under control”. Lukas Engelberger, the official responsible for co-ordinating federal health policy, said at the same press conference that the cantons and federal government would do all they could to avoid another public lockdown. The Swiss public in general support that approach. The outcry to an otherwise minor gaffe by public health officials a month ago underscores the extent to which many Swiss are suspicious of renewed curbs on social life. An official report from July 31 erroneously wrote that two-thirds of new infections in Switzerland were traceable to pubs and clubs. In fact, the government’s figures, corrected days later, showed that just 1.9 per cent of new infections occurred in nightclubs and a further 1.6 per cent in bars and restaurants. Most — 27 per cent — occurred within families. Switzerland’s virus case numbers have, nevertheless, been steadily rising. The Federal Office of Public Health reported 216 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the rolling seven-day total to 22 cases per 100,000 residents. The UK government imposed a two-week quarantine requirement on all arrivals from Switzerland on August 27. Critics warn that Switzerland is flirting with complacency. The rebound of Swiss social life over what has been a long and dry summer has been an almost entirely al fresco affair. As temperatures drop, it is unclear whether the virus caseload will tick up further as people gather indoors. Bern has insisted that its confidence is backed by hard science. While the infection rate has inched up over the summer, admissions to hospital and deaths have barely moved upward from their post-lockdown lows. There are an average of just 3 deaths from Covid-19 a week in Switzerland. Additionally, Switzerland’s tracing app and contact tracing programme has so far proved effective. The app has 2m downloads already — roughly a quarter of the population. While more are needed to make it fully effective, the early figures are promising, health officials believe. “Switzerland has experienced a lower death rate than others and that’s due to a strong healthcare system,” said Suzanne Suggs, professor at the University of Italian Switzerland in Lugano and vice-president of the Swiss School of Public Health. “[Even] while pushed to its brink, we could handle it better than many countries.” Nevertheless, she warned, a lot could change in the coming months. Effective communication will be key. “Everyone is tired of the pandemic and wants this virus to go,” she said. “But it is not tired of us.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-02-20;Strict anti-Covid measures applied to Swiss mass events;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/strict-anti-covid-measures-applied-to-swiss-mass-events/46008002;The government has announced a series of conditions for the resumption of mass events in Switzerland, which have been limited since March to curb the spread of coronavirus infections. Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose portfolio includes health issues, said events with more than 1,000 participants were important for society, notably sports and culture, as well as the economy. “It’s good news for the public, but it’s a huge responsibility for the organisers,” Berset told a news conference on Wednesday. As of October, mass events need permission by cantonal authorities which have to base their decisions on the epidemiological situation in the region and the tracing capacities. Organisers also have to put in place protection measures to prevent a new spike in Covid-19 cases. National football and ice-hockey matches – the most popular sports events in Switzerland – are also allowed to admit crowds of spectators again. However, spectators must wear hygiene face masks and be seated. The maximum number of sold tickets must not exceed two thirds of the normal capacity. The sale of alcohol will be permitted. Berset said Switzerland was one of the first countries in Europe to authorise a return of mass events. “It’s another step towards normalising the situation without losing control,” he said. The government introduced sweeping restrictions on public life in March and started easing them gradually three months later. However, Berset warned it is crucial for Switzerland that the pandemic remains under control during the autumn and winter months. He acknowledged that the government decision made it particularly difficult for organisers of cultural events. In a first reaction, the cantonal authorities have described their task as “very challenging”.
2020-02-20;Swiss foreign minister will visit Iran to mark 100 years of ties;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-to-celebrate-100-years-of-iranian-links/46008108;Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis will travel to Tehran this week to mark the centenary of Swiss-Iranian diplomatic relations. Switzerland currently holds “protecting power” mandates to mediate between Iran and the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia.   Cassis will meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani during the September 5-7 trip. He shared on Twitter that he had also spoken to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the planned visit. On the agenda are discussions about the humanitarian aid channel that allows Swiss-based companies to send medicines and other essential goods to Iran. The first shipments of medical supplies to help Iran combat the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Tehran through the channel in July. Talks will also take place on the latest developments after the 2015 nuclear deal which eased sanctions against Iran in return for a limiting of the country’s nuclear activities. Human rights and political developments in the Middle East will likewise be included on the agenda. Discussions will also focus on bilateral relations and Switzerland’s protecting power mandates. Switzerland has represented US interests in Iran since 1980 and in June helped secure the release of US detainee Michael White from an Iranian prison. In 2017, Switzerland assumed protecting power mandates for Iran in Saudi Arabia and for Saudi Arabia in Iran. Since 2019 it has also represented Iranian interests in Canada. 
2020-02-20;Switzerland enjoys decade-long high atop UN innovation ranking;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-enjoys-decade-long-high-atop-un-innovation-ranking/46007602;Switzerland has been ranked as the world’s most innovative country for the 10th year in a row by the United Nations Global Innovation Index (GII). The annual ranking lists the competitiveness of 129 countries based on 80 measurements. It is compiled by the UN’s World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the business school INSEAD and Cornell University. Just like last year, Switzerland heads the table in 2020 followed by Sweden and the United States. Switzerland achieves consistently high marks for the number of patents filed, strength of workforce and universities, published scientific articles and government effectiveness. It compares less favourably when it comes to the ease of starting a business or getting a loan and for producing its own science and engineering graduates. Announcing its innovation index results on Wednesday, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry highlighted the role that innovation can play in restoring economic fortunes that have been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. “Governments need to ensure that rescue packages are future oriented and support the individuals, research institutes, companies and others with innovative and collaborative new ideas for the post-Covid era,” he stated. “Innovations equal solutions.”
2020-01-20;Freight traffic through Swiss Alps drops significantly;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/freight-traffic-through-swiss-alps-drops-significantly/46005460;The Covid-19 pandemic caused transalpine freight traffic to fall by 12% in the first half of the year. Rail and road were affected in equal measure. The reason for the decline was weaker industrial activity and the resulting lower flow of goods, the Federal Office of Transport said on Tuesday. The slump was particularly pronounced from mid-March onwards, especially goods traffic to and from Italy. After a slow recovery in May, in the second half of June transport levels returned to those of the previous year or slightly higher. A total of 408,000 trucks passed through the Swiss Alps in the first half of 2020, around 57,000 fewer than in the first half of 2019. In contrast to previous crises, such as the financial crisis of 2008, rail transport maintained its market share of 71% of transalpine freight traffic. How the situation develops in the second half of the year depends to a large extent on further economic recovery and the course of the coronavirus pandemic, the transport office said.
2020-08-31;Coronavirus: Swiss close transit travel loophole;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus--swiss-close-transit-travel-loophole/45998846;From August 31 people will not be allowed to enter Switzerland from a coronavirus “high-risk” country on a transit flight via a non-risk country, the authorities have announced.  Those who come to Switzerland from high-risk countries  - those not in the Schengen zone or on the list of exceptionsExternal link - will be denied entry, if they do not hold a Swiss passport, Swiss residence permit or EU/EFTA passport. The list of countries deemed high risk is updated regularly by the authorities.  “Until now, it has been possible to circumvent the entry restrictions by travelling via airports in countries not on the high-risk list,” a State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) statement said on Friday. External link Effectively, the country of departure now counts, not the stopover country, the statement clarified.  For example, it will no longer be possible for third-country (non-European Union/EFTA) nationals to fly to Switzerland from the USA (on the list, so barred from entry) via Toronto (in Canada, not on the risk list so allowed entry).   Citizens and residents of Switzerland, in addition to EU/EFTA nationals, may always enter the country, no matter where in the world they are travelling from. However, those who do enter Switzerland from any of these countries External linkmust go into 10-day quarantine upon arrival. But passengers travelling from a non-high-risk country will be able to enter Switzerland even if they have a stopover in a high-risk country, provided they do not leave the transit area of the airport, the SEM said.  Here it gave the example of passengers from third countries on the list of exceptions in the COVID-19 Ordinance 3, such as Japan, Australia or New Zealand, who may enter Switzerland even if they have to change flights in a high-risk country on like Turkey, because no direct flights were available.  Unfortunately, we cannot research and answer individual questions about travel and entry into Switzerland. An official infoline for people travelling to Switzerland can be called at +41 58 464 44 88 (6am–11pm) A previous version of this article stated that high-risk countries are those from which travellers must quarantine upon arrival in Switzerland. In fact, in this context, high-risk countries are those from which travellers are barred from entry altogether, if they do not hold a Swiss passport, residence permit or EU/EFTA nationality. 
2020-08-31;Health minister rejects hospitals’ plea for Covid compensation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/health-minister-rejects-hospitals--plea-for-covid-compensation/46003508;Hospitals will not be compensated for lost earnings after being told to halt routine procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. Swiss health minister Alain Berset said extra costs could be made up by the state, but not missed revenues. An organisation representing public and private clinics, H+ Swiss Hospitals, is complaining of a CHF2.6 billion ($2.9 billion) hole in income following a five-week freeze on elective procedures at the height of the pandemic. The government had called a halt to non-essential healthcare using emergency powers. Hospital officials met with Berset on Tuesday but failed to get a commitment for compensation. Berset said hospitals still had time to make up for the losses by the end of the year. However, the minister said he was open to further discussions with hospitals and cantons about meeting the bill for extra costs incurred by Covid-19. Berset’s comments came on the same day that the Schaffhausen parliament voted to demand compensation for lost earnings in the canton. Hospitals and clinics in the canton estimate the cost of the elective treatment freeze will run to a double-digit million amount. General practitioners have also seen a financial shortfall as a result of the pandemic. Two-thirds of doctors’ surgeries in Switzerland expect to end the year with financial losses, according to a survey in July.  More than a third of surgeries had to put staff on short-time work while a small minority had to lay off some workers.
2020-08-31;Chinese-owned Swissport agrees emergency takeover;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/chinese-owned-swissport-agrees-emergency-takeover/46003068;A consortium of investors has agreed a €800 million (CHF860 million) bailout of Chinese-owned airport services company Swissport. Revenues at the company have nosedived since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The consortium of US and British private equity firms and banks will buy out the majority stake currently held by Chinese conglomerate HNA. The bailout will comprise a €300 million short-term cash injection to meet immediate financing needs followed by a €500 million package. The deal will wipe €1.9 billion of debt from the company’s books. With air travel coming to a virtual standstill, Swissport saw sales fall by 70% between March and the end of June. The company, which handles cargo and offers passenger ground support services at airports, recorded a €67 million operating loss in the same period. “Swissport is one of the first companies globally to agree to a restructuring following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. We expect to see increased outsourcing of ground handling services by airlines and being able to take volumes from some financially weaker competitors,” said Swissport Chief Financial Officer Peter Waller in a statement on Monday. HNA bought Swissport for CHF2.7 billion in 2015, but the Chinese group has been forced to get out of some investments since before the pandemic struck, including Zurich headquartered airline caterer Gategroup. HNA is also thought to be looking for a buyer for its Zurich-based aircraft maintenance company SR Technics. The pandemic has forced Swissport, which is active at 300 airports in 47 countries, to shed 17,000 of its 64,000 global staff. The deal to buyout HNA is expected to be completed by the end of the year. 
2020-08-31;Geneva Airport expects 23% fewer passengers in 2021;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-airport-expects-23--fewer-passengers-in-2021/46002522;Geneva Airport officials say the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic will reverberate into next year, with the number of passengers flying to and from the airport expected to be down by almost a quarter compared with pre-coronavirus levels, according to Swiss public radio, RTS. Geneva Airport Director General André Schneider described the current situation as “extremely fragile” in an email sent to staff on Friday, which has been seen by RTS. He wrote that passenger numbers next year are expected to be down by 23% compared with 2019 and figures will not return to normal before 2022, RTS reported. Schneider said he was studying all possible options to make savings “both in terms of investments on operational expenditure and personnel costs”, according to RTS. Measures such as a hiring freeze and early retirement for certain staff remain in place. Geneva Airport, like other Swiss facilities, has been badly hit by the pandemic. Between March and June, it was pretty much at a standstill, with only 6-8 flights a day. With the re-opening of borders on June 15, passengers have started to return to Geneva, and the results are encouraging, officials wrote in early August. But passenger numbers are still well down. On July 19, the airport welcomed 16,230 travellers – 30% fewer than the same period last year. The airport still faces many Covid-related uncertainties, such as the worsening virus situation in France, which is responsible for 30% of passengers, and whether British and other skiers will fly to Geneva this winter for their holidays in the French and Swiss Alps. Switzerland’s largest international airport, in Zurich, is also struggling with the pandemic, with a near-total collapse in revenues during its peak. It posted a loss of CHF27.5 million ($30.3 million) for the first six months of 2020. This compares with a profit of CHF143.4 million in the first half of 2019.   In the first six months of 2020, 5.3 million passengers used Zurich airport, a decrease of 64.3% compared with the same period in 2019. The number of flight movements went down by 55.5% between January and June 2020.  There are also signs of a slow recovery in Zurich since the gradual re-opening of borders in June. But it is likely to be several years before the intercontinental market fully recovers, experts say.
2020-08-31;Trading platforms profit from pandemic chaos;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/trading-platforms-profit-from-pandemic-chaos/45996118;While Covid-19 has been wreaking havoc on the economy, many banks and trading platforms have recorded bumper results. Profits were boosted by elevated trading activity, but future prospects are mixed depending on the type of financial player. The months of March and April witnessed chaos in the financial markets, as investors of all shades dumped volatile assets to get their hands on cash. Although the situation has since eased, many analysts expect further turbulence ahead. Volatility creates winners and losers among traders, but for trading platforms and investment advisers, it can be a win-win situation. This is in marked contrast to the 2008 financial crisis that was caused by banks and led to many being bailed out with state funds. Announcing its half-year results, the Swiss stock exchange spoke of “record-high volatility” during a bout of “unprecedented market turmoil”. The exchange witnessed its highest-ever trading activity during one week in March. The pandemic had one negative impact on half-year results for exchange operators SIX Group, which suffered from a drop in credit card and ATM transaction fees, as shops closed and people stayed at home and avoided cash. But this was more than made up for by a 60% spike in trading profits. Digital trading platform Swissquote has enjoyed an even greater bumper harvest so far this year. Revenues had shot up nearly 40% by the end of June and net profits rose by an even more impressive 128.5%, to more than CHF50 million ($55 million).  Swissquote expects revenues to weigh in at CHF300 million by the end of this year, up by nearly CHF70 million from 2019. Another online trading specialist, Saxo Bank Switzerland, is due to post its results in the coming days. It has seen a tripling of new clients in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2019. Trading volumes across all asset classes were also up by 70%. “Besides the high market volatility, this was also due to the fact that people were in home office and had more time to take care of their finances, for which they preferred to use online digital trading platforms,” the bank stated. Digital players that reach a wide audience clearly believe that their prospects are bright. A new entrant, Flowbank, will step into this arena in the autumn, having won a Swiss banking license in July. The digital financial platform hopes to sign 5,000 clients a month onto its trading app before expanding operations outside of Switzerland. Many traditional banks have also reported boosted revenues on the back of advising clients on how to navigate the pandemic, and by executing trades on their behalf. But in many are nervous about their future prospects. Credit Suisse reported decade-high profits for the first half of 2020 that increased by nearly 50% on the same period last year. Surging trading revenues were responsible in good part for these results. UBS, Lombard Odier and Julius Bär also saw profits inflate during the same period. But Covid-19 has also brought problems to the financial sector. The assets of wealthy clients managed by private banks were prone to shrinking in value, as investments lost value in the turmoil. The biggest cloud hanging over many banks is how many loans will turn sour as the pandemic and accompanying lockdowns ravage economies. Banks have been forced to put aside more cash to pay for an anticipated rise in loan defaults. Predicting the pandemic’s future effects on both the general economy and financial markets is proving difficult. “The range of possible outcomes remains very wide,” says UBS.   Credit Suisse expects the pandemic to “keep adversely affecting our business performance, including a potentially significant impact on credit losses.” 
2020-08-30;Swiss want fewer kisses but more hugs;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-want-fewer-kisses-but-more-hugs/46001196;Nearly half of the people in Switzerland would welcome more personal space. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, many say social situations were too close for comfort. In a survey commissioned by Swiss dating agency Parship.ch, 42% of men and 48% of women said they wanted more distance in everyday life. Regardless of age and gender, around four out of ten respondents said they had felt obliged to allow more contact than they would have liked. However, 53% miss hugs and handshakes. Yet many could do without hello and goodbye kisses. According to the survey, 38% miss that ritual. Among those under 30, it’s only 22%. Two out of three respondents said that the current hygiene rules were creating unnatural distance between people, and that they looked forward to life as it used to be. “In everyday life there is a clear difference between wanting more contact and having to have more contact because social norms dictate it,” according to Parship.ch psychologist Dania Schiftan. Digital market and opinion researcher MarketAgent conducted the study in late June / early July. It surveyed 1,008 people aged 18-69 in German- and French-speaking Switzerland. 
2020-08-30;Swiss economist says Covid-19 ‘winners’ should pay more tax;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-economist-says-covid-19--winners--should-pay-more-tax/46000958;Companies that netted their best-ever earnings during the coronavirus crisis should be subject to extra tax, finds one of Switzerland’s top economists. Jan-Egbert Sturm, director of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute, made the suggestion in an interview with Sunday newspaper SonntagsBlick. Sturm, who also heads the economic committee of the national Covid-19 task force, pointed out that certain businesses have done very well thanks to the pandemic – with some food retailers, online shops and pharmaceutical companies earning more than ever before. “We could consider taxing the profits of the crisis winners higher, and using that money to support the losers of the crisis,” Sturm said, pointing out that the chance to profit during the pandemic has been a matter of luck, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, where politicians and bankers had made mistakes. In contrast, Sturm noted that event planners as well as travel, catering and hotel companies got into financial difficulties through no fault of their own. “Therefore a redistribution would be justified in my opinion.” Incidentally, “there is no way around letting certain businesses go bankrupt,” Sturm said, adding that while the state could not prevent job losses in some industries, it could help create new jobs elsewhere. 
2020-08-29;Swiss writer badly hit by coronavirus reflects on the crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-writer-badly-hit-by-coronavirus-reflects-on-the-crisis/45990312;Jonas Lüscher, 43, lay in a coma for seven weeks after contracting the coronavirus. The German resident says he is angered by people who downplay the virus. He also talks in this interview about how good literature can help our understanding of the crisis. Jonas, you had the coronavirus. How did the illness affect you? I got it badly. On March 15, I jumped in at short notice to help out in the Munich municipal elections, working at a polling station and then counting ballots. That’s where I got infected. First I got the usual symptoms – a cough and high fever. After a positive test, I was transferred to the hospital. There the doctors diagnosed pneumonia and my condition deteriorated rapidly. I was put into an artificial coma and onto a ventilator. I was in a coma for seven weeks, in intensive care for a total of nine weeks, and in rehab for three weeks. My lung function is still somewhat limited and I am struggling with the usual side-effects of a long coma, but happily I haven’t suffered any cognitive damage. How do you view the public debate after this experience? I find it very strange to say the least that even immunologists are still publicly saying the coronavirus isn’t dangerous for healthy people under 45. This would probably have annoyed me even if I hadn’t been infected. Now it annoys me even more, because this downplaying of the risks is a denial of my whole sickness experience. I don’t belong to a risk group, I was healthy with no pre-existing conditions, and I am not yet 45. It’s clear why this line of argument is a comforting one: If the virus only affects the elderly and those already sick, then we can lock them in. But this is firstly wrong – it’s not only my coronavirus experience that shows this – and secondly, inhuman. And thirdly, it doesn’t work, as we have seen from the Swedish example. As for all the conspiracy theorists… these people are frankly a disaster. Does the coronavirus reveal a greater evil?  It would be a shame to miss the opportunity provided by this crisis to ask ourselves some fundamental questions. The pandemic is like a magnifying glass – it enlarges social imbalances that already existed and reveals the problems clearly. We have to ask whether an economic order that is so vulnerable because of its dependence on constant growth and unbridled consumption can still be considered sensible in the light of a pandemic. We also have to ask whether we shouldn’t fundamentally rethink our relationship with animals. And in view of the gigantic aid packages, we should think about who is carrying the biggest burden, who is the most vulnerable, and how we can share this burden more fairly. Once again, questions of wealth distribution and justice are paramount. Are these questions being discussed at all? No, astonishingly. But it’s pretty obvious that in this extraordinarily dramatic situation wealthy families like the Hoffmanns, the Oeris, the Brenninkmeijers and the Blochers should give up a billion or two. Even so, this discussion is not taking place. Everyone seems to hope that we can soon return to the pre-coronavirus era. It might be that in three or four years we’ll look back at 2020 and the coronavirus as just a distant, horrible memory, in the same way that many people can barely remember the 2008 financial crisis. But it’s also possible that our old normality will never return. And we’ll have to adapt. You say redistribution of wealth is an important issue arising from the coronavirus crisis, but there is not necessarily an obvious connection. Yes, there is, absolutely. The coronavirus crisis threw inequalities in our society into sharp relief. Anyone with a lovely villa complete with garden and swimming pool on the Zürichberg can seize the coronavirus crisis as a chance to slow down, no problem. Practice some yoga, or brush up their French. A single mother with two teenage sons living in a small rented apartment has a completely different experience of the crisis. Her life becomes more precarious because of the coronavirus. Yes, we do need to distribute money better. Why is no one aware of this? Because we have internalised the neo-liberal thinking of the last 30 years. We simply lack the imagination to conceive of a better world. Apparently, we still can’t imagine that carers deserve better pay and working conditions, even though their importance has become very obvious in the last months. You are a Social Democrat. Your own coronavirus crisis – combined with society’s – seems to have strengthened your convictions. Yes. This crisis is proof that we need a competent state. Just take a look at the US, which has completely broken down in the crisis: a weak welfare state, a miserable health system, a decaying infrastructure and incompetent people in key positions. Not just Trump, but Bolsonaro and Johnson also look bad. Does the coronavirus spell an end to the era of populist dilettantes? Of course this crisis is revealing. Trump and others like him clearly have no mastery of the basics of their administrations and no clue about crisis management. The question is whether their voters care at all – whether the reality can make an impression on their fanatical followers. In the case of Trump, one of these crazy interviews that he gives should be enough to convince anyone he is unelectable. The fact that Jair Bolsonaro escaped with a mild dose of coronavirus is a great shame in terms of the lessons that could have been learned. It seems to validate his “it’s just the flu” line. Unlike Boris Johnson, who seems to have got it quite badly... I read that his coronavirus illness has changed him and made him more reflective. That is of course good news in one way. On the other hand, it’s not acceptable that a politician only becomes sensitive to a problem after he is personally affected by it. If a prime minister has to get the coronavirus to acknowledge the problem then that makes him unequal to the task. In your latest book, you say society undervalues story-telling and worships statistics. The coronavirus contradicts you: We need stats in order to understand the number of cases and probabilities. On the surface, that appears to be the case. Yes, we need scientific precision in the coronavirus crisis, and epidemiology is indeed above all a statistical subject. But the question remains: What do we do with all these figures? We have to use them to develop a narrative. Figures alone don’t say anything. So we need narratives based on these figures – narratives that are enlightening and universal. The Berlin virologist Christian Drosten is a good example of a competent story-teller of science. His podcasts are nothing more than figures, which Drosten turns into understandable, careful and nuanced stories. Germany can count itself lucky to have a scientist like him. At the other end of the spectrum are the most stupid coronavirus stories of all – point-blank denial with conspiracy theories added to the mix. At the peak of the first wave, apocalyptic coronavirus stories were also popular. Lukas Bärfuss, for example, predicted that Switzerland would suffer worse than Italy. It’s always easy to mock “panic-mongerers”. Christian Drosten made this lovely observation: “There is no glory in prevention.” And that’s how it happens: A few people sound the alarm, so precautions are taken that mean it is not as bad as they warned – and they look like alarmists. However, if they hadn’t issued warnings and no precautions were taken and things got worse, they would presumably be accused of inaction by the same critics. And it wouldn’t have taken much: Let’s imagine the Basel Fasnacht carnival had taken place. The pandemic really could have caused as much damage here as it did in northern Italy. You are convinced that literature can lead to a better understanding of the world. Will there be a big coronavirus novel that opens our eyes? If the press soon starts announcing the big coronavirus novel, I think we can be sceptical. In most cases, those enormous expectations demand too much of books. One novel can’t deal with a subject like the coronavirus comprehensively. It’s more likely that there will be a web of creative narratives – films and songs, too – that emerge gradually and enable us to gain a more multifaceted, deeper understanding of the coronavirus. This doesn’t mean that terms such as “corona” or “viruses” are necessarily the explicit topic. It’s also about the impact of the pandemic on big human themes like “love” and “family.” In the same way that the good stories about the 2008 financial crisis – for instance, texts by Rainald Goetz or John Lanchester – dealt with the crisis implicitly. In your books Barbarian Spring and Kraft, you also address the financial crisis and the crisis of neoliberalism. Is the coronavirus interesting literary material for you? From a social perspective, yes. I won’t write about my own illness – or at least nothing that I will publish. But I am sure my writing will change in some way after the coronavirus – and I would imagine it’s the same for every serious author. Coronavirus has consequences for the arts: concerts are barely possible any more and the same goes for big book readings, while many companies are on the brink of bankruptcy. Are we about to see devastation across the cultural landscape? It’s a very critical moment, for sure. Much of what is disappearing now will not return. Small, subsidised enterprises will have a hard time. And many areas of cultural production are self-reliant – independent theatre, jazz, dance, but also literature. For many, it’s a hand-to-mouth existence. Most writers can’t live from sales of their books. They need readings, which are now cancelled. It’s particularly hard for those whose books were published in the middle of the lockdown. They may have worked five years on a novel that simply disappears into a black hole. And what about the much-discussed book renaissance? Hmm, I think a lot of people just did more streaming (he laughs). The bookshops were of course shut during the lockdown and couldn’t profit much from it. Perhaps one or two people took a book down from the shelf again. But anyone who didn’t read before the lockdown won’t have started reading during the lockdown. What are your feelings as we head towards autumn and winter? I am very worried. If we have to go into lockdown again, we will have a much higher price to pay. Economically of course, but socially too: single people who get lonely, families in small apartments, broken and violent relationships, unemployment… And you personally? I was lucky despite my bad luck – I would say I escaped with a very black eye. The doctors assume that I am immune to the virus for a while. I lead a privileged life in many respects – I have a spacious apartment, I am in a good relationship. I have a small financial cushion. I have it relatively good.

2020-08-28;More young adults report symptoms of depression;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/more-young-adults-report-symptoms-of-depression/45997866;Increasing numbers of young adults in Switzerland are suffering symptoms of depression, according a new national health report. But the suicide rate among those under 25 has decreased by half over the last 30 years. Overall, however, nine out of ten young people who participated in the National Health Report 2020 study said they felt in good health. The research was carried out by the Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) before the coronavirus pandemic. In all, 13.5% of 16-to-25-year-olds said they suffered medium to severe symptoms of depression in 2017 – up from 10.4% in 2012, according to the report. This compares to 8.6% among the entire Swiss population. When it came to full-blown depression the rate was 3.6% (compared with 6.6% among the general population). The number of 11-to-15-year-olds with multiple psycho-affective complaints (tiredness, bad moods, nervousness, sadness, anxiety, anger issues, problems getting to sleep) has also increased, especially issues linked to sleep and tiredness, the study found. The suicide rate has dropped by half over the past 30 years: by 51% among girls and young women and by 62% among boys and young men. Suicide nevertheless remains the most frequent cause of death among young adults over 16, the report noted. In 2017, 87 children and young people committed suicide. Overall, nine out of ten young people said they felt in good health, Obsan reported, “despite the fact that two out of every ten children, young people and young adults live with either a chronic health risk or chronic disease”. This includes obesity, which has reduced slightly among younger children. Road accidents have also reduced significantly, even they are still one of the main causes of death among children and teenagers. For example, among those under 14 years of age, there are as many traffic accident deaths as cancer deaths, the report said. The National Health Report 2020 presents current knowledge about the health of children, young people and young adults in Switzerland, taking into account their environment and health behaviour, as well as the health system. The data is aimed at helping officials draw up health promotion policies “in order to be ready for future challenges” such as newly discovered risks from digital media. However, the report’s authors note that some data gaps need to be filled.
2020-08-27;UK adds Switzerland to quarantine list;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/uk-adds-switzerland-to-quarantine-list/45996348;Switzerland was added on Thursday to the growing list of countries from which travellers coming into the United Kingdom will need to quarantine. The 14-day quarantine applies from Saturday, August 29 at 3am GMT (5am Swiss time). UK transport minister Grant Shapps announced the news on Thursday, indicating that the measure was needed to slow the spread of the virus. Data shows we need to remove the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland from our list of Coronavirus Travel CorridorsExternal link to keep infection rates down, Shapps said in a statement. The rule applies to UK residents and visitors. People arriving from Cuba, however, would no longer have to quarantine, he added. In June, London imposed a quarantine on all travellers arriving in the UK, before finally choosing to exempt those from certain countries in July, depending on the rate of coronavirus infection. In July, the UK government removed Spain from its travel corridors list, taking some holiday travellers by surprise. Switzerland has seen the number of positive cases inch upwards in the past few weeks. There were 361 new positive cases in the past 24 hours bringing the seven-day average to over 266. On Thursday, Belgium added three more Swiss cantons to their coronavirus warning list, which includes Zurich, Geneva and Basel City.
2020-08-27;Syria talks resume in Geneva after Covid-19 suspension;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/syria-talks-resume-in-geneva-after-covid-19-suspension/45995826;The Syrian Constitutional Committee resumed talks in Geneva on Thursday afternoon after a three-day pause due to positive cases of coronavirus among four participants. The United Nations Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said talks will restart “with all the necessary precautions” after health authorities deemed that there was no further risk of contagion. He added that while follow-up testing done in recent days indicated that the earlier positive cases do not pose any risk, the talks would only proceed at the Palais des Nations in Geneva among those who have tested negative. Participants had been tested for the coronavirus before and after arrival in Geneva. The wearing of masks and strict social distancing measures were also in place when they met at the Palais des Nations at the start of the week. However, the cases were discovered a few hours after the talks began, leading to the 45 members of the constitutional committee being required to quarantine in their hotel and continue working online. The talks aim to make progress in drafting a new Syrian charter to pave the way for UN-sponsored elections, in line with a stalled 2015 UN Security Council resolution. The committee is made up of representatives from the Syrian government, the opposition, and civil society. The desire to resume talks is “a signal of the importance of this process”, Pederson said. The meeting is the first of its kind in nine months and the third session of the constitutional committee. The pandemic forced the postponement of an earlier meeting in March.
2020-08-27;Higher ed, research officials reject immigration initiative;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/higher-ed--research-officials-reject-immigration-initiative/45994894;Curbing free movement would be harmful to education and research in Switzerland, the country’s top research officials have argued. The country relies on attracting top scientists and on international collaboration to tackle crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. Representatives from five major university and research bodies were speaking ahead of a nationwide vote, set for September 27, on a Swiss People’s Party-backed initiative to scrap the free movement of people accord with the European Union. The vote is seen as crucial for future relations between non-EU member Switzerland and the 27-nation bloc – and for Swiss education, research and innovation (ERI), as speakers at a joint press conference in Bern on Thursday pointed out. Switzerland needs to be able to attract the best researchers as “these are the people who are busy developing vaccines against the coronavirus, or inventing equipment to enable people with spinal injuries to climb stairs again” It would be hard to bring in talented people and good ideas from the EU without the free movement accord, officials said in a joint statementExternal link. Yves Flückiger, head of the umbrella body swissuniversitiesExternal link, and rector of the University of Geneva, gave the example of Isabella Eckerle, who leads the Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases at the University of Geneva. Her laboratory developed one of the first diagnostic tests for the coronavirus in January 2020 and, in the first phase of the pandemic, was in charge of the confirmation tests for Swiss samples. Eckerle is a German national and her interest in coronaviruses dates back to 2011, when she worked in a top lab in Berlin. “The exchange between these two labs is the reason why the diagnostic tests were developed in Switzerland,” Flückiger explained. Around half of partnerships between research groups are formed within Europe, he added. Free movement also allows Swiss researchers to work abroad and bring their know-how back to Switzerland. The initiative also jeopardises Swiss participation in EU research programmes. “Let’s learn from the consequences of the mass immigration initiative of 2014,” said Michael Hengartner, president of the ETH BoardExternal link, which oversees the top-ranked federal technology institute ETH ZurichExternal link and its sister institution in Lausanne, the EPFLExternal link. After the controversial 2014 vote to re-introduce immigration quotas for EU citizens, Switzerland was effectively barred from EU research programmes, including the key Horizon 2020. This ban was later partially loosened (Switzerland is still excluded from the Erasmus education exchange programme, although it can now fully participate in Horizon 2020). This meant fewer international projects and less funding from the EU for Swiss researchers. “Great damage was done to Swiss science, and the repercussions are still being felt today,” Hengartner stated. Angelika Kalt, director of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF,)External link added that Switzerland needed to exert an influence on scientific progress. “Switzerland has to be part of these programmes to find solutions to big societal problems like climate change,” she said. In addition, the post-Covid era will force everyone to rethink mobility and the relationships with Switzerland’s neighbours, said swissuniversities’ Flückiger. “Our neighbour, our natural partner, is Europe,” he said.
2020-08-26;New Swiss rail timetable speeds up cross-border trips;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-swiss-rail-timetable-speeds-up-cross-border-trips/45993346;"Next year the train connections from Switzerland to Germany and Italy will be faster. On Wednesday the Swiss Federal Railways unveiled the timetable for 2021. In addition to various inland tweaks, the new schedule brings swifter links from Zurich to Milan (3:17) and Munich (ca. 4hrs). From Zurich there will be ten direct trains to Milan; from Basel, five. The capacity for the Zurich-Munich connection will be doubled from three to six trains per day. There will also be two direct trains per hour from Lucerne to Zurich Airport. Overall, the new schedule, effective as of December 13, will mean about 1.4% more regional and long-distance trains in operation. However, the coronavirus pandemic will make it a challenge for the railways to fully implement the timetable. And in addition to interrupted construction work, the railways also face a shortage of 210 train drivers. This means that on weekdays, some 200 out of 9,000 trains will be cancelled. As the railways told the media on Wednesday, the staff shortage is down to Covid-19 measures that postponed training for new drivers. Courses running from November to May 2021 should reduce the shortage to 110 drivers. Following a downturn in numbers during the Covid-19 lockdown, passenger trains are now filled to about 70-75% of their capacity."
2020-08-26;Swiss private banks brace for coronavirus impact;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-private-banks-brace-for-coronavirus-impact/45993150;The Swiss private banking sector saw a resurgence in fortunes last year but faces an uncertain future as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to play havoc with financial markets. Favourable market conditions in 2019 allowed the 84 banks surveyed by KPMG to grow client assets by 14%, according to a recently published report by the audit firm. Most of this growth was created by flourishing financial markets, with just 3% attributable to fresh deposits from the world’s wealthy. Nevertheless, the annual “Clarity on Performance of Swiss Private Banks” report heralded the return of “net new assets” to Swiss coffers as a potential turning point in the sector’s fortunes. The ability to attract fresh inflows of money from around the world and to help clients grow their wealth are highlighted as key metrics in determining the health of private banks. The situation so far this year is proving harder to judge. While the report suggests that some banks have leveraged the Swiss safe haven status to attract new funds, others are clearly struggling as clients bailed out of investments. Julius Bär saw net new asset deposits of CHF5 billion in the first six months of 2020, but this was well down on the CHF6.2 billion recorded during the same period last year. Credit Suisse saw inflows drop by almost three-quarters while UBS saw little change. KPMG predicts that private banks will struggle to attract new clients for the rest of the year as travel restrictions continue to hinder the all-important face-to-face meetings usually required to persuade people to open new accounts. This could have a knock-on effect for revenues, which showed some promising signs of improvement in 2019. However, net profits continued to underwhelm as banks struggled to keep staffing, regulatory and IT costs under control. Only one private bank ceased operations last year, bringing the number down to 101 from 163 in 2010. One more bank has disappeared already this year and two mergers are pending. KPMG repeated its oft-quoted prophesy that more private banks will disappear from the landscape in the coming years, particularly smaller branches. Those that fail to adapt to the changes imposed by Covid-19 are most likely to fall, says the report. Its authors say as many as 30% of existing banks face such a risk.
2020-08-26;World Economic Forum postponed due to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/world-economic-forum-wef-2021-postponed-covid-19/45992960;Next year’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been postponed from its traditional January slot as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers say it is likely to take place in early summer after experts said it was too dangerous to hold in January. It is not clear exactly when or where the event will take place, if at all. Details will be released “as soon as we are assured that all conditions are fulfilled to guarantee the health and safety of our participants and the hosting community.” It is the latest in a long list of major Swiss economic, cultural and sporting events to be affected by the wake of Covid-19. In June, organisers announced a new-look event for January, entitled “The Great Reset”. It was supposed to have been staged as a half physical event in Davos, with far fewer people attending, and with a virtual connection to 400 cities worldwide. “The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent,” WEF added. WEF says its flagship event contributes tens of millions of francs each year to both Davos and the Swiss economy as a whole. Many hotels and restaurants rely on the annual influx of wealthy participants for a large slice of their income. The 50-year-old forum, held annually over several days in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, attracts thousands of high-profile participants from around the world. WEF started life as the European Management Forum in 1971. Founded by German-born businessman Klaus Schwab, it was designed to connect European business leaders with their counterparts in the United States and offer ways of boosting links and solving problems. It is a non-profit organisation with headquarters in Geneva and is funded by the varying subscription fees of its members. The forum took its current name in 1987 as it broadened its horizons to provide a platform for finding solutions to international disputes. As the forum grew in size and status in the 1990s, it attracted rising criticism from anti-globalisation groups, who criticised the elitism and self-interest of participants. 
2020-08-25;Pandemic forces historic cancellation of Swiss open-air voting;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-forces-cancellation-of-swiss-open-air-voting/45991050;Canton Glarus’s open-air assembly (“Landsgemeinde”), the oldest form of direct democracy in Switzerland, will definitely not take place this year. It is the first time the event has been cancelled since the founding of the federal state in 1848. The Covid-19 pandemic had already pushed back the event, at which people squeeze into a central square and vote by raising their hands, from the first Sunday in May to September 6. The assembly in nearby canton Appenzell Inner Rhodes, which normally takes place at the end of April, had already been cancelled this year. Political business was decided at the ballot box last weekend. The government in Glarus, in eastern Switzerland, announced on Tuesday that urgent business would be dealt with by the cantonal parliament instead of the assembly. The remaining items on the agenda would be moved to next year’s event. It said the main reason for the cancellation was the fact that the maximum number of coronavirus cases set by the government “will most probably be exceeded”. A limit had been set of ten unrelated cases of infection in the two weeks preceding the Landsgemeinde. The number of infections has been rising continuously since the beginning of August in Glarus, as it has across the country. Between August 10 and 24, 16 positive coronavirus results were recorded. The expected low turnout in the voting ring also played a role in the government’s deliberations. The 600-year-old tradition has been postponed several times because of bad weather, but this is the first time it has been cancelled. Voters even gathered in the ring every year during the First and Second World Wars. 
2020-08-24;Zurich shoppers must wear face masks against coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/zurich-shoppers-must-wear-face-masks-against-coronavirus/45988580;After Basel City, Zurich has become the second German-speaking canton to require customers to wear face masks in shops and shopping centres due to the spread of the new coronavirus. The compulsory mask rule, which will come into force in Zurich from August 27, currently exists for shops in cantons Vaud, Jura, Geneva and Neuchâtel in French-speaking regions. The changes come after a rise in new cases in recent weeks. On August 24, the seven-day average for Switzerland reached 257.4 new cases per day, which is a 19% increase from the previous week. It hit 61.4 in canton Zurich - currently the worst-affected region - a 27% increase from the previous week. Zurich health officials warn that the virus is spreading rapidly among younger people aged 20-40. Silvia Steiner, the president of the Zurich government, told a news conference on Monday that the authorities had the situation under control. But new preventive measuresExternal link are needed so that Zurich “does not become a risk area”, she added. In addition to the face masks in shops, Zurich restaurants will be obliged to collect customers’ contact details to assist with tracing. Stricter measures have also been introduced for clubs, bars and restaurants, where a 100-person limit will be tolerated for an interior area. Larger events and gatherings are possible for up to 300 people, but only if the 1.5-metre safe distance rule can be guaranteed or if face masks are worn. This measure applies to sporting events, theatre performamces, cinema screenings, concerts, church services, holiday camps, weddings and birthdays. In Switzerland face masks are also mandatory on public transport, airplanes and at Basel and Geneva airports. The federal government is leaving it up to cantons to decide how far they should go with mask mandates, although it has encouraged cantons to require them in closed public places. However, the face-mask issue has dogged Switzerland’s authorities throughout the pandemic, with every change in policy met by fierce public and political debate. While there will generally be no mask wearing in primary schools this term, several cantons are requiring masks be worn among post-compulsory pupils, aged 15-16, when social distancing of at least 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. This will be the case across the French-speaking part of Switzerland, which has announced a coordinated approach to mask-wearing among older pupils. The German-speaking cantons have no such coordination in place, although some cantons, like Lucerne and Bern, have insisted on masks. This piecemeal approach has already been criticised by teaching unions.  Universities such as the federal technology institute ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich have also introduced a mask requirement starting on August 24 and September 1, respectively.
2020-08-24;Covid cure further away than hoped, says Novartis chief;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-cure-further-away-than-hoped--says-novartis-chief/45987368;Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis has rowed back on earlier predictions that a drug to combat coronavirus could be on the horizon. CEO Vas Narasimhan says it is now more “realistic” to expect the pandemic to continue to haunt the world well into next year. Speaking to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Monday, Narasimhan said Covid-19 is posing more problems than expected with a series of waves striking various countries. “The question is: When will we be so far advanced with vaccines and treatments that the world can live with the virus? We are not assuming that it will suddenly go away or that enough people will be immune,” he said. In April, Narasimhan appeared optimistic about the chances of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine providing relief from the virus. But the drug, which was endorsed by US President Donald Trump, did not pass muster with the World Health Organization (WHO). “We are at a very early stage and it turns out that it is taking longer than we expected,” he said of finding a cure. “We hoped to be able to get more out of the existing drugs for combating Covid and also to be faster in developing a new active ingredient. Now it is clear that we need more cooperation with biotech companies.” Switzerland has signed a deal with US biotech firm Moderna to secure early access to 4.5 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine currently in development. Novartis sold off most of its vaccines unit in 2015 and Narasimhan admitted it would be “incredibly difficult” to re-build this competence from scratch in a short period of time.  
2020-08-24;Universities: higher numbers of students due to corona;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/universities--higher-numbers-of-students-due-to-corona/45987040;Swiss universities are expecting 10-15% more students than usual next semester due the coronavirus, it has been reported. There will be far fewer people taking a gap year. Swiss public television, SRFExternal link, puts the number at 10% in a report over the weekend. The University of Zurich has confirmed that it has received 15% more student applications at Bachelors level and 25% more applications among Masters StudentsExternal link than in 2019. It still remains to be seen how many of these turn into matriculated students, this will be communicated during the autumn semester, university spokeswoman Rita Ziegler told swissinfo.ch via email on Monday. A possible reason for the increase in applications could be that the alternative options usually open to school leavers like a gap year, travelling or looking for a job are not possible or have become more complicated, Ziegler said. For those finishing their Bachelors, it has probably been harder to find a job, so they have decided instead to do a Masters. Many school leavers in Switzerland traditionally take a year out after doing their pre-university baccalaureate exam (although many have not physically taken the exam this year due to the coronavirus lockdown and will be awarded their certificates based on teacher assessment). Border restrictions to contain the coronavirus means that it is harder to go travelling. They usually fund these trips with student jobs, such as working in a bar or restaurant – but these have become rarer due to the financial effects of the virus, reports sayExternal link. The expected rise in students is putting a strain on universities’ distancing concepts. The University of Basel has already reacted: two-thirds of students there will be doing distance-learning after the university starts lectures on September 14. “For students this means that they will have to stay at home for a while and will have less social contact,” rector Andrea-Schenker-Wicki told SRFExternal link. This is something the university regrets, she said. But she pointed out that university’s protection concept had been drawn up with the input of experts and the authorities and that the institution had invested more than CHF100,000 ($110,000) in new technology for the online teaching. But the University of Fribourg is aiming to carry out as much teaching on campus as possible, mostly with masks and cordoning off areas to ensure social distancing. “This is to ensure the special nature of university education and training,” said rector Astrid Epiney in the same report. The university wants its students to learn lateral thinking, argumentation and analysis, she said. Students there said that going back to university was a “great motivation”. An earlier version stated the University of Zurich percentages as registrations, this has been amended to applications.
2020-08-23;Less than 50% of new Covid cases in isolation at time of test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/less-than-50--of-new-covid-cases-already-in-isolation/45986172;"National statistics show that just under half of new Covid-19 cases are already in quarantine when they test positive. Regional figures suggest the number could be even lower. The NZZ am Sonntag reports that the most recent numbers provided by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) show that 44% of people testing positive since May 11 were already in isolation as a result of precautions taken after contact tracing. The FOPH’s numbers are based on medical questionnaires filled out by patients – forms which since May include the question of whether the patient is already in quarantine. Some 30% of the patients said that they weren’t in isolation, while the remaining 26% didn’t answer the question. However, the newspaper writes that the questionnaires were available for less than half of the 9,000 Covid-19 cases reported since mid-May. “The FOPH estimate is thus a bit limited,” it writes. Figures from Vaud and Geneva, two cantons particularly affected by the virus and where contact tracing is widely developed, suggest the figure could be even lower than that reported nationally. For the first week in August, 26% of new positive cases in Geneva were already in quarantine, the NZZ am Sonntag writes; in canton Vaud over the past week, the figure was 30%. And though Vaud authorities told the newspaper this shows a certain impact of contact tracing in preempting cases, University of Bern epidemiologist Nicola Low says the figure is too low. Ideally, some 80% of confirmed cases should already be in quarantine, in order for contact tracing regimes to really be working well, Low said. “If this percentage [currently seen in Switzerland] doesn’t increase, it’s not a good sign for efforts to control the virus.” Contact tracing, through the SwissCovid app and the physical efforts of cantonal authorities, has been one of the major planks of the effort to combat the spread of coronavirus in Switzerland since lockdown measures were eased. On Saturday and Sunday, Switzerland recorded a total of 571 new cases – a rise of 118 compared with last weekend, and a continuation of the upward trend seen since the end of June. Daily case numbers this week climbed twice above 300, a figure that hasn’t been recorded since the height of the pandemic in April."
2020-08-21;Hundreds of pupils in quarantine after holidays;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hundreds-of-pupils-in-quarantine--/45983304;The school term has started in most cantons, but quarantine regulations mean that hundreds of pupils are at home, reports say. The Federation of Swiss Teachers says this is the case for an average 1-2 pupils per class.  People who enter Switzerland from  high-risk countriesExternal link, which include Spain and some nations in the Balkans, must undergo a ten-day quarantine or face a fine. This includes pupils who were due to start school.  According to a survey by the tabloid BlickExternal link, there are 690 pupils across all school levels in quarantine after the holidays in canton Zurich (which started back on Monday). In cantons St Gallen and Basel City (which both started back on August 10), there are 100 and 70 pupils respectively in quarantine.  The head of the Federation of Swiss Teachers said she was not surprised by the numbers. “If we are honest, we are happy that pupils are taking the protection measures seriously and staying at home, rather than coming to school and potentially infecting others,” Dagmar Rösler told Swiss pubic television SRF.External link  She said that on average, from what she had heard, about 1-2 pupils per class are missing from school. Rösler said that most absentees were getting schoolwork to do at home rather than any distance learning.   Rösler said it was important to react with extra measures should the number of coronavirus cases keep rising – on Friday the total number of new cases across Switzerland was officially more than 300. “I’ve had discussions about whether masks should be introduced in entire schools. We are not there yet. But I think we have to try to make the best of the situation and protect pupils and teachers as much as we can at the moment,” she said.  Cantons – which are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland – have different approaches in place concerning how to deal with quarantine issues at schools, with many putting the emphasis on parental responsibility.  In canton St Gallen, the authorities threatened to fine parents if children had to stay at home on quarantine at the beginning of term. According to Blick, however, no fines have yet been handed out.   There have already been cases of whole classes going into quarantine in some cantons that have started back: such as in canton Bern (one kindergarten class and two primary school classes due to a teacher being infected) and in canton Solothurn (six classes in quarantine).   Some cantons in the French-speaking part of the country, like Geneva, will start term next Monday. Canton Ticino, hard hit by coronavirus due to its proximity to Italy, will start back on August 31. The authorities there have not ruled outExternal link putting whole classes into quarantine should it be necessary (for example, later in autumn when there could be a resurgence of cases).  In some cantons face masks are obligatory for older pupils aged 15-16. In Bern, two pupils at a Baccalaureate school (which prepares for university) tested positive for corona, but their classmates were wearing masks, so did not have go into quarantine.  There is currently no enforcement of face marks in primary schools due to the opinion in Switzerland that under 12s are less affected by the coronavirus.

2020-08-21;Coronavirus hits Zurich airport results hard  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-hits-zurich-airport-results-hard--/45982488; Covid-19 has had a severe economic impact on Zurich airport, with a near-total collapse in revenues at times, according to first half results.  Switzerland’s largest international airport posted a loss of CHF27.5 million ($30.3 million) for the first six months of 2020. This compares to a profit of CHF143.4 million in the first half of 2019.   In the first six months of 2020, 5.3 million passengers used Zurich airport, a decrease of 64.3% compared with the same period in 2019. The number of flight movements went down by 55.5% between January and June 2020.  “The coronavirus crisis has had a severe economic impact on the entire aviation industry and on Flughafen Zürich AG [the airport’s operator]. At times, there was a near-total collapse in revenues, which is reflected in first-half business performance,” company CEO Stephan Widrig said in a statement on FridayExternal link.  However, the airport did manage earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of CHF 104.9 million, even if this was a third of the amount in 2019.  During the crisis, the airport operator introduced short-time working and took various measures to secure liquidity. There is expected to be further substantial cuts in capital expenditure and costs over the coming months and years, the statement continued.   The airport stayed open during the spring – the height of the pandemic when Switzerland went into nationwide lockdown and air traffic was almost at a standstill – to accommodate air freight, repatriation and ambulance flights, alongside a few passenger flights.  There are signs of a slow recovery since the gradual reopening of borders in June, the statement continued, with the expectation that the travel sector would start its recovery in Europe. But it is likely to be several years before the intercontinental market fully recovers, it added.  “We are confident that international air traffic will recover over the long term,” said Widrig.  “It is difficult to issue a reliable forecast for the current financial year, owing to considerable uncertainty over the further course of the coronavirus crisis,” the statement added.  A loss is anticipated for the current financial year. 
2020-08-21;Swiss schools abroad face continued uncertainty as new term begins;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-schools-abroad-face-continued-uncertainty-as-new-term-begins/45979540;Many of Switzerland’s official schools outside of the country are still unsure whether they will reopen for the new term after being shut down due to the coronavirus. The government has offered financial help. In Switzerland most schools reopened after the nationwide lockdown in some form before the summer holidays. Many schools have already started the new term under strict hygiene measures, with the latest wave of pupils going back on Monday. But this is not the case for the Swiss schools abroad. As we have previously reported, these 18 institutions are situated in some of the world’s coronavirus hotspots. All had to close due to local lockdowns. Some of the countries, like Colombia, are still hard hit: the South American nation had more than 460,000 cases and 15,000 deaths by mid August, putting it  in the ten most affected countries worldwide, according to Johns HopkinsExternal link. “We hope the schools can open in Italy and Spain, but we know some of the schools, like those in Colombia and Peru, will not open -  they don’t even have a date yet,” Barbara Sulzer Smith, director of the Swiss schools abroad body educationsuisseExternal link, told swissinfo.ch in an update to the situation. “As for China, they hope to open on September 1 with normal classes in classrooms but this can change,” she said. Problems with getting teachers into countries to take up their new posts in Swiss schools have eased somewhat, Sulzer Smith reported. Swiss embassies have helped to organise special flights for teachers to Thailand and Colombia from Frankfurt, Germany. Teachers (of which there are 55 taking up new posts) will have to go into quarantine in their respective arrival countries. But the new Swiss teacher for the Beijing school is still in Switzerland waiting for her visa, according to Sulzer Smith. Swiss schools abroad are private, fee-paying institutions offering a Swiss approach to education, which receive some funding from the Swiss government. It is not necessary for pupils to be Swiss, although 20% hold a Swiss passport. But the coronavirus pandemic has hit hard: there are an estimated 10% fewer pupil registrations and some parents are no longer able to pay the fees, Sulzer Smith says. Schools are also having to invest in extra hygiene measures or in technical infrastructure for ongoing distance learning. Extra income from daycare offers or sports clubs is no longer coming in. The Federal Office of CultureExternal link - which oversees the Swiss schools abroad from the government side - has called the schools’ financial situation “urgent”. On August 12, the Swiss government approved the culture office’s proposal for extra funding. Switzerland already supports these schools with CHF18 million ($19.8 million) a year. They are now being offered access to an extra CHF7 million: CHF3.5 million supplementary credit which still needs to be approved by parliament (and which was done so on September 10)  plus CHF3.5 million from the Federal Office of Culture’s existing credit for Swiss schools abroad. “This emergency aid will be paid out during this year,” Anne Weibel from the culture office told swissinfo.ch via email. To access the funds, schools will have to put in a request in which they set out the total financial damage that cannot be covered with existing financial reserves, Weibel explained. They must also show how they plan to stabilise their financial situation. It is important that the schools can maintain their normal educational services, with extra government funding when necessary, the culture office spokeswoman said. Sulzer Smith says that Educationsuisse welcomes the additional funding.
2020-08-20;Anti-immigration plan fails to inspire voters, poll finds ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/anti-immigration-plan-fails-to-inspire-voters--poll-finds-/45980828;Ahead of September’s ballot, a right-wing proposal to scrap an immigration deal with the European Union enjoys limited support among Swiss voters, an opinion poll has found. However, supporters of a parliamentary decision to spend CHF6 billion ($6.6 billion) on new fighter jets for the Swiss air force have a lead of almost 20 percentage points over opponents from the political left. The survey commissioned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation was carried out seven weeks ahead of September 27, when a total of five issues will come to a nationwide vote. For details see chart below Political scientist Martina Mousson says it is striking to see how stable and entrenched opinions about the anti-immigration initiative have remained over the past five months. “This leaves little hope for the campaigners behind the initiative,” says Mousson, project leader at the GfS Bern research institute, which carried out the survey. She reckons that, barring unforeseen events over the next few weeks, the People’s Party is unlikely to gain much support outside its own grassroots and among fundamental critics of the government. The poll found that citizens in the majority German-speaking as well as the French-speaking parts of the country intend to reject the initiative at the ballot box. Only the Italian-speaking region of Ticino shows signs that it may come out in favour. Mousson says the main reason for the clear lead enjoyed by the initiative’s opponents are concerns that Switzerland’s economic prosperity is at stake if relations with the EU – the country’s main trading partner - are undermined. She adds that pressure around high levels of immigration has clearly eased compared with the situation in 2014, when Swiss voters approved another People’s Party initiative which called for the introduction of immigration quotas for EU citizens. It was anger about parliament’s refusal to fully implement the demands of that initiative that spurred the People’s Party to launch a new proposal. But it now faces a broad alliance of all other major political groups, the business community, trade unions, parliament, and the government. Mousson says the arguments put forward by opponents appear to be convincing citizens better than those who support ending the free movement accord (and most likely six other bilateral accords) Given the currently rather low number of backers (35%), and other results from the survey, Mousson is sceptical about a sudden swing, but she stops short of calling the vote,. “At the moment there are no clear indications that the negative trend will be overturned soon,” she says. A financial package to buy fighter jets looks set for approval by voters in September, according to Lukas Golder, co-director of GfS Bern. He says left-wing opponents, who challenged a decision by parliament last December, may gain additional support among younger people and women voters, particularly in French-speaking Switzerland. But this doesn’t seem enough to repeat a ballot box surprise in 2014, when voters threw out a plan to buy 22 Swedish-built fighter jets in one of the worst democratic defeats for the Swiss Armed Forces. “Respondents in our poll believe that a strong and independent air force is needed,” Golder says. “It seems that the left lacks really convincing arguments in its campaign,” he adds. A new factor to be reckoned with in the political campaigns ahead of the September 27 vote is the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s social distancing regulations. They make public gatherings – a traditional form of targeting the Swiss citizens – much more difficult. Golder says the restrictions make it generally more difficult for opponents to stage protests and organise events, giving a clear advantage to the government and its positions. “The coronavirus pandemic has cast a huge shadow, creating insecurity in general for people, notably about their economic situation,” says Golder. This comes on top of the fact that citizens will have to make up their minds about four other national issues, while in many regions, decisions are expected at cantonal and local levels. Golder also says traditional media – print or mainstream broadcast – have become more relevant while social media and other information channels seem to have lost ground. Nevertheless, newspapers are still struggling to report broadly on the subject matters and to contribute to the opinion-making process vital to a direct democracy. Covid-19 has forced many papers to cut back and reduce the number of pages per edition, due mainly to a slump in advertising revenue. It’s not yet obvious to what exact extent supporters and opponents both of the fighter jet acquisition and the immigration curbs will be affected by the pandemic. But there has been plenty of speculation in the past weeks. The second GfS opinion poll, to be published mid-September, might give a clearer picture.
2020-08-20;Shoppers in Basel must wear face masks to reduce Covid-19 risks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/shoppers-in-basel-must-wear-face-masks-to-reduce-covid-19-risks/45981134;Basel City has become the first German-speaking canton to require customers to wear face masks in shops to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The compulsory mask rule, which will come into force in Basel from August 24, currently exists for shops in cantons Vaud, Jura, Geneva and Neuchâtel in French-speaking regions in the west of the country. Face masks are also mandatory on Swiss public transport, airplanes and at Basel and Geneva airports.  On public transport, the mask requirementExternal link applies to everyone aged 12 or older travelling on trains, trams and buses, mountain railways, cable cars and ships. Federal Railway conductors can ask anyone not wearing a mask to leave the train and anyone refusing will be fined.  The federal government is leaving it up to cantons to decide how far they should go with mask mandates, although it has encouraged cantons to require them in closed public places. However, the face-mask issue has dogged Switzerland’s authorities throughout the pandemic, with every change in policy met by fierce public and political debate. The recent mandatory mask rulings follow an increase in infections in different parts of the country since mid-June. On August 16, the 7-day average reached 208.3 new cases per day, which is a 43% increase from the previous week. Basel City recorded five new infections on Thursday taking the total number of infections in the canton to 1,165. Of these, there have been 149 new cases since June 1. A total of 76 people were in isolation on Thursday and 493 were in quarantine. Fifty-three people have died from the virus in the canton. Basel City health director Lukas Engelberger said the upwards trend was “worrying”. “A determined fight against the pandemic is necessary to combat a massive second wave,” he said in a statementExternal link on August 20. While there will generally be no mask wearing in primary schools this term, several cantons are requiring masks be worn among post-compulsory pupils, aged 15-16, when social distancing of at least 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. This will be the case across the French-speaking part of Switzerland, which has announced a coordinated approach to mask-wearing among older pupils. The German-speaking cantons have no such coordination in place, although some cantons, like Lucerne and Bern, have insisted on masks. This piecemeal approach has already been criticised by teaching unions.  On Thursday, the federal technology institute ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich also introduced a mask requirement starting on August 24 and September 1, respectively.
2020-08-20;Swiss worry more about antibiotic resistance and cancer than Covid-19 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-worry-more-about-antibiotic-resistance-and-cancer-than-covid-19-/45980488;In a recent survey, Swiss say the pandemic poses less of a risk to society than mental illness and antibiotic resistance. Around 60% say they will most likely get vaccinated against Covid-19. The study, commissioned by CSS Health Insurance, took the pulse of 4,200 people from all over the country at the beginning of June – immediately after the first wave of the pandemic. Despite the survey timing, only 0.6% of those surveyed said that Covid-19 was the disease they were most afraid of. Of far greater concern was cancer (36%), dementia (17%) and cardiovascular disease (6%). This may partly be explained by the fact that only 0.3% said a coronavirus infection had been their most serious experience of illness to date. The study authors said that “for the time being the extensive containment” of the coronavirus in a relatively short period of time helped strengthen confidence in public health. Overall, 38% of respondents felt that pandemics pose a major risk to society, behind mental illness, for example (63%). In contrast, 72% of those surveyed believed antibiotic resistance was a greater risk. More than half (53%) considered drinking water contaminated with hormones and pesticides to be a major risk. The survey found some interesting differences across regions. In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, about half of the respondents stated that, in the case of unknown symptoms, they would first wait to see whether they would disappear on their own. Much fewer in the French- and Italian-speaking parts of the country take a wait-and-see approach. About 33% of those surveyed indicated they would definitely get vaccinated against the coronavirus and another 30% would probably do so if a vaccine were available. The willingness to be vaccinated is particularly high among older groups. The survey was conducted by Sotomo research centre in June. A first sample was surveyed in March. In a separate surveyExternal link conducted by the University of Zurich, young people appeared to be coping despite disruptions to their studies and working lives. Since 2004, the “Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood”, called z-Proso, has been following the life of young people in Zurich. In the latest survey, the z-Proso team asked around 700 participants in April how the coronavirus crisis affected their everyday lives. With the gradual easing of measures in May, around four out of ten participants said their lives had been severely derailed, while one in three stated that their life was not seriously affected. Many indicated that they suffered not being able to see friends and family during the lockdown period but some 75% considered the public health measures to be fair and effective and agreed with them. Some views changed over time though. Two-thirds of respondents in April felt that it was wrong not to observe social distancing while fewer than 40% thought so in May.
2020-08-20;‘The purchase of new fighter jets cannot be put off’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-the-purchase-of-new-fighter-jets-cannot-be-put-off-/45945920;"Fighter jets are an integral part of the security system keeping Switzerland safe, argues People’s Party member Thomas Hurter in the lead up to the September 27 vote. On September 27, Swiss voters face a fundamental decision: do they want to maintain an independent air defence capacity or not? Government and parliament want to update the country’s air defence by replacing fighter jets that have been in operation since 1978 and 1996. The new ones will cost a maximum cost of CHF6 billion. Every neutral, sovereign country has its own air force, including functioning fighter jets. Alongside its defence role, the air force also carries out monitoring tasks and rescue operations in peacetime, rather like the police on the ground. It provides security for conferences and helps aeroplanes in trouble. But the defence of the population can only be ensured if the ageing fleet is replaced. This would also ensure it can continue to provide support for ground troops in future. If the population rejects the procurement in the autumn, Switzerland will no longer have an air force after 2030 and it will be unable to carry out its duties and fulfil its military defence obligations. Both the purchase and the maintenance of the new aircraft would be financed exclusively from the regular military budget. No supplementary or special financing is necessary, and neither the education budget nor any other state service will be cut as a result of the procurement. The state has a number of tasks to fulfil, among them a responsibilities for the safety of the army; it rightly allocates part of its budget to this. Purchasing the necessary services for defence and day-to-day air policing from an external provider would definitely not work out cheaper than procuring it ourselves. For Switzerland, a neutral country, a defence pact with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is out of the question from a legal perspective. The problems of procuring masks during the coronavirus crisis have shown that every country looks after itself first. The opponents of the purchase, particularly in the Social Democratic party, often bring up alternatives to fighter jets such as training aeroplanes, helicopters or drones. The Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport has classified these options as inadequate for air force operations because they don’t fly high and fast enough. But behind these social democratic proposals is another motive: its goal is to abolish the army, something printed in black and white in their political programme. Relying on ground based air defence systems alone is not a sensible option, as these weapons simply shoot down foreign objects. With aircraft, problems can be identified in the air and on that basis, necessary decisions can be made. And keeping the F/A-18 fleet in operation for longer is not practical because these planes will reach the end of their shelf life in 2030. Maintaining them beyond this date would cost the state a great deal of money. It’s the same story as with any vehicle: at some point, a car reaches the end of its working life and has to be replaced. Procuring new fighter jets cannot be postponed. It has to happen now, not least because the entire evaluation process will take about ten years. Our security is ensured by a system of parts: not just the ambulance, police and fire services but also military forces on the ground and in the air. All the elements in this chain need the capacities and means to carry out their tasks. The current global situation shows us just how unstable some regions of the world are. It is therefore important to look ahead and invest in our current and future security. What is true for the fire service is also true for the air force: you don’t wait until the house is burning to buy a new fire engine."
2020-08-20;Cover-up? How shifting policies affect Swiss attitudes toward masks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cover-up--how-shifting-policies-affect-swiss-attitudes-toward-masks/45978462;The issue of face masks has dogged Switzerland’s authorities throughout the pandemic, with every change in policy met by fierce public and political debate. Is it fair to blame the government for any lingering doubts about the need for masks to fight Covid-19? Back in March, when the number of cases of the novel coronavirus was soaring in the country, the advice from both the Federal Office of Public Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) was clear: healthy people had no use for surgical masks. In the words of the WHO, they would be “wasting a mask” if they wore one. “The population cannot effectively protect itself with masks,” said Daniel Koch, the Swiss government’s delegate on Covid-19 at the time. It didn’t take long for mask wearing to become a hot-button issue, with accusations from across the political spectrum that a mask shortage was dictating public health policy. The public too has been divided on the need for face masks. Many complained the government had not recommended them soon enough. Yet few actually donned them once authorities changed their policy.  Some experts believe that the government’s initial position continues to have an impact on people’s attitudes toward mask wearing, which has since become mandatory on public transport. Early in the pandemic, the Swiss government – like the WHO – recommended masks only for those caring for the sick, people in risk groups and those with symptoms. But as the country was reaching the peak of the outbreak, both politicians and the public questioned the soundness of that decision. It was widely reported that there were then just two-and-a-half weeks’ worth of masks available for the population, which led to a claim that officials were covering up a shortage and “informing people strategically”, as Green Party member of parliament Bastien Girod put it. He, like many others, wanted the government to urge people leaving their homes to wear masks. The claim proved persistent, convincing nearly 60% of respondents to a Tamedia poll in mid-April, who agreed the government had not mandated mask wearing because the face covering was in short supply. Then, in July, Sunday papers Le Matin Dimanche and SonntagsZeitung reported that records of meetings of crisis management authorities in March showed a mask shortage had influenced the government’s position. But the public health office disputes this. Spokesperson Yann Hulmann told swissinfo.ch that, although it was true there weren’t enough masks in stock for the entire population at the time, “this [had] no causal connection with the absence of a [generalised] mask-wearing recommendation”. During the lockdown, when people were being advised to stay at home, there was no need for the widespread use of masks, Hulmann added. “Fewer people were on the move during those weeks and the [recommended distance between people] could generally be kept.” Koch, who was head of communicable diseases at the public health office until his recent retirement, has always maintained that the government’s mask policy was based on scientific evidence. According to him, in the early days of the outbreak, studies did not clearly show that masks provided effective protection against the virus. Sarah Tschudin Sutter, an immunology and infectious diseases expert, confirmed that “the evidence base to support the use of masks, especially for the public, was limited, even more so in March.” Nevertheless, a team she leads as part of the national Covid-19 scientific task force concluded in an April 20 report that, despite some conflicting evidence in the literature, there was “a risk-benefit ratio in favour of generalised mask-wearing when conducted in association with hand hygiene, whenever social distancing cannot be maintained.” The task force recommended the government introduce a policy along those lines. With some businesses set to re-open later that month, the issue of face masks was top of the public debate agenda. The mid-April poll by Tamedia revealed 60% of people in Switzerland supported mandatory mask-wearing in public. But at the end of April, just as lockdown measures were being eased, the authorities stopped short of making the public’s wish come true, opting instead for a recommendation that people wear masks when physical distance could not be respected. “I’m confident that growing scientific evidence contributed to this decision,” Tschudin Sutter said, adding that coming out of lockdown meant that “new approaches for infection prevention and control were necessary”. Around the same time, the WHO also switched gears to make a similar recommendation. Meanwhile the Swiss army’s efforts to buy face masks were paying off, with some 35 million masks flooding the market by the end of April, putting an end to the shortage. Although not everyone was convinced by the government’s initial line that masks offered little effective protection to healthy people, saying this was based on scientific evidence did make a lasting impression. “The communication early on has resonated strongly,” said Angela Bearth, a risk researcher at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich. “The Swiss have high trust in science and so rely strongly on it, and this is true especially with Covid.” “So when [the authorities] said that science doesn’t show masks are useful, this sticks with people.” By June, as more people began leaving their homes to go back to the office or to school, few were wearing masks. Just 6% of passengers at train stations in Switzerland sported masks, despite the government recommendation to don them on public transport. Bearth and her colleagues polledExternal link people at various points during and after the lockdown. In their final survey, taken just after masks became mandatory on public transport (on July 6), they found non-mask-wearers were more likely than mask-wearers to believe that, according to messages given by public health officials, there was little scientific evidence the face covering protected against the coronavirus. “We see the change in recommendation in response to the evolving science creating mistrust among some in the population,” said L. Suzanne Suggs, who co-wrote a report on crisis communication for the Covid-19 task force. Both she and Tschudin Sutter pointed out that once masks became mandatory on buses and trains across the country, compliance improved – not because the Swiss are “blindly obedient”, Suggs added, but “rather because such a mandate communicates just how important masks are”. According to a follow-up report on masks by the task force published in early July, “[o]ver the past three months, important additional evidence has accrued, which more strongly supports the benefits of public use of face masks”. By then, Austria, France, Italy and Germany had already mandated mask-wearing in public places, leading even interior minister responsible for health, Alain Berset, to concede Switzerland was out of step with its neighbours.  Seeing such disparities in policy can influence some people’s decision-making. “For those who are skeptical about mask-wearing, inconsistent recommendations add reason to doubt,” said Suggs, a professor at the Università della Svizzera italiana. “They highlight differences in the epidemiology, in interpreting scientific evidence, or the influence of politics.” On the other hand, with masks mandatory on public transport, “many people understand they are now known to be beneficial at slowing the spread of the virus,” Suggs added. This understanding has led to yet another turn in the debate: if there are benefits to wearing a mask, why not make it mandatory elsewhere? They must now be worn in shops in just a handful of cantons – Jura, Vaud, Geneva and Neuchatel. Koch, known for his unflappable demeanour throughout the crisis, gave a blunt assessmentExternal link of the debate in an interview with the tabloid Blick in July: “The mask question was overrated from the beginning. The same applies today as three months ago: keeping distance is more important than wearing a mask. And wearing a mask tends to make you lose your distance.” Yet many in the medical community have voiced support for extending the obligation to wear masks to all places where groups of people gather, including shops. This would make sense from an epidemiological standpoint, the head of the Swiss Association of Cantonal Doctors told Swiss public radio SRF. According to risk communication expert Bearth, however, wearing masks everywhere could lead to a false sense of security, and to people neglecting other important measures, such as social distancing, a pattern that has been observed in other preventive behaviours. “It may be helpful to also promote these other measures when communicating with the public, instead of overestimating what masks can do,” she said. The federal government is leaving it up to cantons to decide how far they should go with mask mandates, although it has encouraged them to impose these in closed public places. Suggs, the public communications professor, said that unless people “believe they have a responsibility to wear a mask when physical distancing cannot be respected, and feel social pressure to do so, mandates may be needed.” That, or getting to a point where mask-wearing is easy, socially accepted and socially expected, Suggs said, adding that Switzerland is not there yet.
2020-08-20;Covid-19 leads to record drop in Swiss employment;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-leads-to-record-drop-in-swiss-employment/45979750;"The latest work figures show that 85,000 fewer people are employed now than at the same time in 2019 – the biggest decline since 1993. According to the second quarter federal labour statisticsExternal link released on Thursday, there are 1.6% fewer people employed in Switzerland compared with this time last year. The drop was slightly higher for women than for men (1.7% and 1.5% respectively). Those in partial unemployment are not classified as out of work, in the statistics. But as a result of Covid-19-driven restrictions on business activities, many people worked fewer hours. The Federal Statistical Office (FSO) said weekly hours per employed person fell by 9.5% in this period.  If only full-time equivalents are considered, gender differences are greater. For men, the fall in the number of people who worked full-time was 0.4%, compared to 2.4% for women.  Some 223,000 are now unemployed – that’s 17,000 more than 2019. Young people (15-24 years old) were particularly affected by the crisis: while the unemployment rate for the whole population climbed from 4.2% to 4.6%, it increased from 6.2% to 8.4% for the youth. Between the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, the number of employed Swiss nationals fell by 2.4%, while the number of employed foreign nationals increased by 0.2%. However, this varies significantly according to the type of work permit; those holding a short-term (12 months) L permit saw a big drop in employment of 16.2%. People with a long-term C permit, which often includes foreign nationals born in Switzerland, saw employment increase by 2.3%. The figure for cross-border workers also increased by 3.6%. Kudelski is the latest Swiss company to be hit by the coronavirus crisis. In its second-quarter results released on Thursday, the digital security company based in the French-speaking part of the country said that it has relied heavily on partial unemployment. Its number of full-time equivalent staff was down 14%, or 489 positions, compared to six months ago. Kudelski also said in a press releaseExternal link that its half-year results were well below forecasts, with annual turnover down 20.1% to $320.1 million (CHF292.8 million). Earlier this week Swiss retailer Manor announced plans to reduce approximately 5% of its workforce due to online competition and the effect of coronavirus on sales. Other federal statistics also released on Thursday revealed that Swiss industry has suffered the biggest decline since 2009 due to the coronavirus crisis. Production and sales in the secondary sector, which includes construction, fell more sharply between April and June than at any time since 2009. The only exception was the pharmaceutical industry."

The Lebanese population is now dependent on emergency aid. Swiss Solidarity is intensifying its appeal for donations with the support of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, swissinfo.ch’s parent company. Swiss Solidarity's partner relief organisations were already on the ground helping Syrian refugees, who make up one-fifth of Lebanon's population. They are now distributing food, water, medical aid and materials to repair homes. Lebanon was in the past called the the Switzerland of the Middle East . However, since 2019 the country has been experiencing a major economic crisis. And it has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Now comes the explosion of a cargo of ammonium nitrate in Beirut. Images of the devastation have been seen around the world. The Swiss ambassador to Lebanon, Monika Schmutz Kirgöz, was slightly injured in the blast. Switzerland has already donated CHF 500,000 ($554,000) to the Lebanese Red Cross and sent a team of specialists, who will test the stability of buildings in the affected areas.

While the loan will be 85% guaranteed by the Swiss state, German approval was first needed for a wider Lufthansa group aid package.    The funds will also be used to bail out the Zurich-based charter airline Edelweiss, which was taken over by SWISS in 2008 and is also part of the Lufthansa group. “We are very grateful that the financial support which we have been assured of by the Swiss Confederation will now be provided in the form of these loans,” said SWISS CEO Thomas Klühr. “This support will enable SWISS and Edelweiss to weather the present crisis, which has been caused by factors beyond our industry’s control, and to continue to gradually resume our flight operations as we have been doing since June 15.” SWISS reported a CHF266.4 million loss in the first half of this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Passenger numbers fell by 64% in the period as turnover dropped by 55%. The use of Swiss state funds to bail out the airlines has been criticised in some quarters because they are German-owned companies.
2020-08-18;Neo-banks challenging Swiss financial sector;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/neo-banks-challenging-swiss-financial-sector/45968500;New digital banks are popping up in Switzerland without a single branch or counter.  One of them, Zurich-based Neon, is staking its success on doing more with less and has attracted 30,000 customers. The digital bank is not present at the prestigious Paradeplatz in the heart of Zurich, the symbolic heartland of Swiss banking. NeonExternal link is instead located on the outskirts of the city, and no works of art, stylish furniture or marble floors adorn its offices. The interior is a simple and open plan with minimal furnishings. It’s a typical venue for a start-up that focuses its efforts entirely on product development. Neo-banks communicate with their customers purely via digital channels. At Neon, when opening an account via the smartphone app, customers are asked to submit a photo of an official ID and the data is checked by via a video call or the digital identification procedure approved by the Swiss Financial Market Authority (Finma). The customer then receives a debit card for purchases in Switzerland or abroad and has a bank account that allows for credits (such as salary) to be paid in and payments to be made at home and abroad. Neo-banks like Neon are gaining market shares in the banking sector as they offer more innovative solutions for online payments than traditional banks, generally with fewer fees. They also integrate contactless payment services such as Samsung Pay more easily into their apps. “We saw a gap in the Swiss market, so we decided to give up our jobs and start our own company,” says Jörg Sandrock, CEO and co-founder of Neon. He is one of four young former financial advisors who launched the start-up. After an initial test phase, the company officially launched a banking app in March 2019 that has now attracted 30,000 customers. Few fees Most traditional banks charge an annual fee of CHF50-CHF100 ($55-$110) for a standard credit card, in addition to between 1.5% and 2.5% for each payment with a further surcharge of around 2% on the exchange rate on foreign payments. If money is withdrawn from an ATM, a commission of CHF10 is often charged. Cheaper and more transparent fees are part of the reason for the rapid success of neo-banks in many European countries, including Switzerland, in recent years. Last year, the British digital bank Revolut shook the Swiss banking sector when it announced it had won 250,000 customers in Switzerland with almost no advertising. The Revolut app has now been downloaded 300,000 times - a number that many Swiss banks can only hope for with their own apps. The success of these neo-banks - also known as mobile , smartphone or challenger banks – points to a change in the banking industry. For many financial services, the physical proximity of a bank to its customers or direct relationships with advisors is becoming less important. Internet shopping has also become more popular, particularly during the coronavirus crisis. New online payments players have emerged, including the internet giants who are increasingly interested in developing new financial services. The monetary policy of the central banks, which is based on zero or very low interest rates, has also drastically reduced the profit margins of traditional banks. About 20 years ago, banks began charging higher fees and transaction commissions, causing many customers to look for alternatives. The Swiss Bankers Association recently underlined in a statement the importance of digitising financial services, emphasising the progress that Swiss banks have made in this area. Many banks are closing their branches or converting them into pure advice centres, focusing on digital offerings. So far, however, e-banking offers such as apps have not proven attractive enough to lure many digital natives. Only one traditional bank, Cler, has developed an app comparable to what neo-banks offer, according to a comparison done by Swiss Public Television. Did Swiss banks miss an opportunity? “I don't think so, but maybe they were a bit paralysed by their cumbersome organisational structure,” says Neon’s Sandrock. “Perhaps there was less pressure to be different in Switzerland than in other countries.” Sandrock notes that in Spain, after the 2008 financial crisis, some banks were forced to adopt a new strategy to survive. In England, competition has been so strong for years that banks have also been forced to innovate to attract new customers. Overall, though, neo-banks have failed to cast a sizeable shadow over the traditional banking sector and its scope. New foreign providers such as Revolut or Transferwise (with whom Neon has a partnership) offer credit cards and international payment services, but little else. And Neo banks’ profits are incomparable to those coming from the asset management services that have made the Swiss financial centre rich. But traditional banks are nervous about the rapid growth of challenger banks in an increasingly open and competitive market. Neon is convinced it can make waves in the financial market. According to a 2019 study by the online comparison portal Moneyland, Neon scored better marks than foreign competitors and traditional Swiss banks when comparing prices for services, commissions, exchange rates and the cost of using credit cards. But Neon is unable to provide a number of banking services, such as securities trading or mortgage loans, because it does not have its own banking license. Instead, it works with Hypothekarbank Lenzburg which manages its customer accounts. The bank’s boss says this is intentional. “What sets us apart from a traditional bank is the fact that we don't want to develop and offer every financial product,” says Sandrock. “We work with specialised partners in areas that we don’t cover ourselves.” “I believe this to be the future of the banking business as it will be increasingly difficult to generate profits from developing every product independently.”
2020-08-18;Multinationals must take responsibility for supply chain workers in the pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/multinationals-must-take-responsibility-for-workers-in-their-supply-chains-during-the-pandemic/45974416;"It’s easy to do good during a period of economic growth but it is in times of crisis that companies reveal their true commitment to workers. The coronavirus pandemic took us all by surprise. For the world’s unions, the immediate priority was protecting the safety and livelihoods of working people. By negotiating pay during lockdownsExternal link in many countries, millions of workers were able to stay safely at home, slowing the spread of the virus and saving lives. The global shutdown was unprecedented, and the world is forever changed. For some, it reinforced our sense of our common humanity, our responsibility towards one another. We have all been moved by examples of sacrifice and solidarity. We have also realised that many of the essential jobs that hold our societies together are some of the worst paid and least respected. Many have learned the value of supermarket, transport and delivery workers, of health workers and hospital cleaners, who often had to go to work without protective equipment. We are not all in this together. We all face the same storm, but some are on dry land, others on seaworthy boats, while still others cling desperately to rafts and debris. Income inequality has been growing for years, and the pandemic has sped up the process. Women and people of colour have been disproportionately affected. Some political leaders ignored and downplayed the crisis, or used it for political ends. Others burned political capital, making unpopular lockdown decisions to save lives. In IndiaExternal link, the Philippines, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia and elsewhere, the pandemic was used as an opportunity to weaken labour protections and attack human rights. It’s easy to do good during a period of economic growth but it is in times of crisis that companies reveal their true commitment to corporate social responsibility. Some multinationals used their power and influence to hold society together; others took advantage of the crisis. On one end of the spectrum are those companiesExternal link that took government bailout money, paid dividends to shareholders, and then used the pandemic as an excuse to force through changes they wouldn’t get away with in normal times, laying off workers, casualising jobs and increasing the pace of production. At the other end are companies that took responsibility for their supply chain, and worked out deals with suppliers, unions and national governments to hold things together in the short term. They also worked towards a sustainable new normal in the medium and long term. For instance, Belgian chemical multinational Solvay paid no dividends, and management took pay cuts. Most companies fall somewhere between these poles. Our job, as global trade unionists, is to move them in the right direction, towards global social dialogue. Workers in the textile and garment sector in countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam lost their livelihoodsExternal link as global fashion brands refused to pay for orders they had placed. Facing bankruptcy, many supplier factories laid off workers. Some brandsExternal link committed to addressing the issue. Despite this, in many cases, suppliers used the pandemic as an excuse to fire workers and break unions. This has been a depressingly familiar dynamic, and in many sectors, companies made sure that workers were first in line to pay the costs of the crisis. A spate of industrial accidents in India showsExternal link that employers are often quick to sacrifice lives to maintain production, and many countries and sectors saw mass layoffs. A lot of the worst abuses happened in private companies in developing countries that many customers have never heard of, but these companies exist in an ecosystem: they are part of global supply chains ultimately controlled by multinational corporations. One company that changed its behaviour under pressure from ourselves and unions around the world is Inditex, the Spanish garment multinational that owns popular high street brands like Zara and Massimo Dutti. Responding to the jobs crisis in the countries that produce fashion, Inditex made a commitmentExternal link to not only honour orders made to supplier companies, but to guarantee an ongoing payment schedule and provide financing to keep companies afloat. Inditex also committed to ensuring that as factories reopen, they do so safely. Crucially, the company’s compliance with these commitments will be monitored by a global union committee, representing the company’s workers from around the world, including at supplier factories. The fashion industry has unique characteristics – notably, consumer-facing brands that are sensitive to public opinion – but the model of giving stakeholders real power to determine the future of the industry is what we must work towards across the economy. Mining has been not seen this level of collective responsibility. Mining companies generally extract much of their value from poor countries with weak labour laws and safety standards. Many prefer a hands-off approach, with local subsidiaries tasked with maintaining a steady flow of commodities while resolving all problems locally. Early in the pandemic, hundreds of miners were infected with Covid-19 at the Antimina mine in PeruExternal link, a joint venture between BHP Billiton, Swiss-headquartered Glencore and others. We’ve tried to engage these mining giants in dialogue for years, and we’ve made some progress with Glencore. Although we don’t have a global agreement, an informal dispute resolution mechanism in place before Covid-19 has helped to address issues like that at Antimina, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ZambiaExternal link and elsewhere. We have been less fortunate with BHP Billiton, who refuse to work with unions on a global level, and have used coronavirus as an excuse to break collective agreementsExternal link. Within this spectrum, other dynamics have emerged, such as companies treating blue- and white-collar workers differently, or looking after workers in their home countries while ignoring those elsewhere. Volkswagen generally has good relations with unions, and despite some recent tensionsExternal link, negotiates at a global level. In Germany, the company ensured the safe reopening of auto plants after lockdown restrictions were eased. But in South Africa, after 120 workers contracted Covid-19 at the Uitenhage plantExternal link, the ministry of labour found that the company had violated regulations for the safe return to work. When workers exercised their legal right to refuse unsafe work, Volkswagen suspended the union shop stewards. The issue is now being resolved by the global works council, but it shows where the cracks lie in our interconnected global system. Companies are required by the economic system to maximize value for shareholders, which conflicts with their commitments to corporate social responsibility. Even the better companies are bound by the same market forces, and must compete with less scrupulous rivals. This creates a moral hazard that can reward bad actors with a competitive advantage. Ultimately, this can only be resolved by binding global standards that ensure a baseline of decency for all. Our unions believe it is time to build a Just RecoveryExternal link that rewards those who made sacrifices by building the foundations of a better future now. We need a global 21st century industrial relations system that acknowledges our connections to each other. We must protect workers’ health and safety, change global governance to create employment and decent work, fight for universal social protection and quality public services, defend democracy and workers’ rights, regulate global supply chains, develop sustainable industrial policy and secure manufacturing jobs, fight for gender equality and give workers a voice in determining the future of work. New laws are one part, which is why the Responsible Business InitiativeExternal link in Switzerland, and similar proposals in other countries that seek to ensure corporate respect for human rights, are important. We also need to enforce the rules already in place including the International Labour Organisation conventions, and binding global agreements between workers’ representatives and companies. Let’s not waste this crisis. This is the time to build a fairer and more resilient worldExternal link. Valter Sanches is the general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union. IndustriALL is one of five global unions based in the Geneva area, and represents 50 million workers in the manufacturing, mining and energy sectors worldwide.

2020-08-17;CNN Money Switzerland to cease operations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cnn-money-switzerland-to-cease-operations/45973536;Switzerland’s first national English language business channel, CNN Money Switzerland, has announced it will stop broadcasting due to economic uncertainty amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The board of directors unanimously decided to file for bankruptcy, according to a company statement on Monday. “Over the past six months, the impact of the new coronavirus pandemic on CNNMS’s revenue has been considerable,” the statement said. “The company’s revenues have contracted rapidly as its business partners (…) have cancelled or postponed their contracts,” it added. The company said it will try to limit the consequences on its 25 staff members and business partners. However, CNNMS which was launched at the beginning of 2018, said it recorded sharply rising audience figures, apparently reaching an average of 150,000 unique visitors per month. CNNMSExternal link has targeted senior executives, CEOs and influencers in Switzerland. At the launch, CNN executives said the venture would “fill the void” for business programming in English in a country in which up to half of the population are said to use or work in English every day.

The two companies posted information on their websites asking customers to avoid opening the e-mails and to delete the suspicious messages from their inbox. Both Swiss PostExternal link and Swiss Federal Railways (on the personalised SwissPassExternal link website) said they had received reports of an “increasing number” of attempts at fraud on the internet over the past few days. They said they were cooperating closely with the government’s Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance (MELANIExternal link). It is part of efforts to boost cybersecurity and combat computer fraud. Researchers also noted a considerable increase in cases of internet fraud in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Creative criminals have been trying to trick people out of their money in online scams, also by stealing personal information. The number of cyberattacks reported in Switzerland during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic was up to three times higher than normal.

The Basel-based firm has drawn up a redundancy plan.  The company revealed that 91 out of 830 positions will be eliminated at the Basel headquarters and 385 in department stores across the country. Manor is a significant player in the Swiss high street with 59 department stores, 30 supermarkets and 27 restaurants. The company is owned by the Geneva-based holding company Maus Frères.  There are no plans to close any subsidiaries though, as the group regularly assesses the profitability of the various sites, said a company spokesperson. In Zurich, where Manor had had to abandon its flagship location on Bahnhofstrasse after a lengthy dispute with landlord Swiss Life, the company is still intensively looking for an alternative solution, the spokesperson added.  The retailer, under pressure from e-commerce and weakened by the coronavirus pandemic, wants to accelerate multi-channel distribution by bringing together purchases made in its stores and online.  The coronavirus crisis has hit the non-food sector within the retail trade hard, but it has also had a catalytic effect, said CEO Jérôme Gilg, and that the acceleration in our e-commerce activities is in line with our two-year progress strategy .  Manor's stated objective is to increase the current share of online commerce fivefold by the end of 2024. The management wants to focus on fresh products and gastronomy in the food segment and on fashion, beauty, interior decoration and household items in the non-food segment. 
2020-08-17;First Mediterranean cruise since lockdown set sail after Covid-19 testing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/first-mediterranean-cruise-since-lockdown-set-sail-after-covid-19-testing/45972456;The Swiss-registered MSC Grandiosa has become the first large cruise ship to set sail in the Mediterranean Sea following the lifting of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The ship with about 2,500 passengers on board left the Italian port of Genoa on Sunday for a seven-night cruise in the western Mediterranean Sea. Passengers and crew had their temperatures checked and took Covid-19 tests as part of new health and safety protocols, the MSC Cruises company said. Guest must wear face masks in elevators and other areas where social distancing is not possible. The crew spent time in quarantine before the start of the cruise. For now, MSC was limiting its guests to the residents of Europe's 26-nation Schengen visa-free travel zone. Earlier this month, the Italian government gave its approval for cruise ships to once again depart from Italy’s ports but limited cruise ships to sailing with 70% capacity. The launch of MSC Grandiosa following a five-month break, is seen as a first step towards rebooting an industry that generates an estimated $150 billion (CHF136.3 billion) for the world economy, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. Cruise ships and the business they bring to many Italian cities during port excursions make up an important segment of Italy's vital tourism industry. An estimated 12 million cruise ship passengers arrived or departed from Italian ports last year or made port calls in Italy, according to industry figures. More than 3,000 Covid-19 infections as well as at least 73 deaths, were registered on board cruise ships. MSC CruisesExternal link is registered in landlocked Switzerland and is based in Geneva.It was founded in Italy in 1989.

2020-08-17;How I built my own Swiss watch – in a day;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/horlogerie-_how-i-built-my-own-swiss-watch---in-a-day/45968000;Imagine assembling your own Swiss mechanical watch and taking it home with you at the end of the day. swissinfo.ch tried out the popular new concept run by Jura start-up Initium. For fans of Swiss timepieces, the watchmaking world can sometimes seem like an impenetrable castle. The uninitiated rarely get the chance to observe or even touch delicate mechanical watch parts. This is what gave Mathieu Gigandet and Gilles Francfort the idea of creating Initium five years ago. Their start-up offers beginner watchmaking courses open to all ages. The firm, which employs eight people, has workshops in Noirmont, canton Jura, and in Geneva and Zurich. It proposes various half- and full-day courses, which cost from CHF1,690-2,690 ($1,860-2,950). The price includes a handmade watch – created by yourself. The little-known concept has taken off in recent years. Several rival firms now also offer similar courses. Today, Initium faces an uphill challenge as it attempts to rebuild its business amid the difficult economic situation resulting from the coronavirus lockdown. Fewer foreign tourists, who made up half of all visitors to Initium’s Geneva workshop, are taking the courses. This has caused a big dent to the start-up’s finances.
2020-08-16;Families face large differences in tax rates across Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/families-face-large-differences-in-tax-rates-across-switzerland/45971288;A comparison of tax rates across different cantons and cities found that Zug – home to many multinational companies – offers the most attractive tax regime for families. According to an analysis by the French-language paper Le Matin DimancheExternal link, a married couple with two children and a modest income of CHF60,000 ($66,000) doesn’t pay any income tax in Geneva and Zug. In contrast, the family would pay CHF1,562 in the city of Biel in Canton Bern. A couple without kids and a higher salary of around CHF125,000, pays CHF5,451 in taxes in Zug. In Geneva, they would pay three times more in taxes and even four times more in Neuchâtel. Geneva has a much more progressive tax rate than other cantons. As soon as a couple reaches an upper middle-class income of about CHF175,000, residents pay much more in taxes than those in neighbouring areas. Millionaires also pay a hefty share in Geneva relative to other cities and cantons. In the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the city of Sion has the lowest tax rate whereas Lausanne and Neuchatel have gained a reputation for being a “fiscal hell” says the paper. Canton Zug is well known for its fiscal attractiveness that has led firms such as commodities and raw materials giant Glencore and multinational Johnson & Johnson set up shop in the canton. It’s also been positioning itself as the capital of cryptocurrencies. In June, the Zug parliament agreed to reduce the tax rate as an attempt to relieve pressure on families during the coronavirus crisis. This was met with criticism from left-wing parties as a public relations move.
2020-08-16;Switzerland needs more courage to think big, says ETH board president;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-needs-more-courage-to-think-big--says-eth-board-president/45971106;The head of the board of the federal institutes of technology - Switzerland's two top-ranked universities internationally - wants a culture of innovation in Switzerland that moves faster and thinks bigger. “Our knowledge should flow even faster into innovations that are brought onto the market,” Michael Hengartner told the German-language paper NZZ am Sonntag in an interviewExternal link. A biochemist and biologist by training, Hengartner became president of the ETH Board, which oversees the two federal technology institutes in Zurich and Lausanne, at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in February. Switzerland invests a lot in education and basic research and is very good at experiments and pilot projects. However, it “often lacks the courage to think big,” said Hengartner. ETH has developed a start-up taskforce to help in this respect but Hengartner says there is more to do to compete with the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in bringing discoveries to market. “Today, the survival rate of our startups is 90 to 95%. You can interpret that in different ways. The negative view would be that we wait too long to be completely sure - and as a result miss opportunities,” he said. “We need more Musks in Switzerland.” He believes a kind of Marshall Plan is needed in areas like climate and digitization and to bring solutions to market quicker and to scale them. Hengartner told the paper that the coronavirus has reinforced the importance of science but also some of the challenges in deploying the science to get the pandemic under control. He acknowledged that politicians have to consider many factors, not just scientific facts, when making decisions. “Our job is to provide facts. How politicians decide is their responsibility.”
2020-08-15;Doctors in Switzerland uncover coronavirus in skin sample;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/doctors-in-switzerland-uncover-coronavirus-in-skin-sample/45970346;Doctors at the University Hospital Basel have confirmed a positive coronavirus case from a skin sample after a nasal swab test came back negative. The case concerns an 81-year-old woman who was tested for coronavirus because she displayed symptoms including a fever. Both a nasopharyngeal swab coronavirus test and an antibody test, which was performed six weeks later, were both negative. When the patient arrived at the hospital, she also had a skin rash. A team of dermatologists at the university hospital tested a sample of her skin for coronavirus, which came back positive. The findings, published in the LancetExternal link, raise a host of questions about potential shortcomings in current nasal swab testing. The study authors write that “swab samples that are taken incorrectly are known drivers of the relatively large number of false negative tests for SARS-CoV-2”. Testing skin biopsy samples could be used as an additional diagnostic tool according to the authors. The study also contributes to the hypothesis that some patients with Covid-19 might not establish immunity.
2020-08-13;Road Cycling World Championships cancelled;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/road-cycling-world-championships-cancelled/45966216;The sports event became the latest large-scale event to throw in the towel after the government recently decided to extend coronavirus restrictions. “We are sad and disappointed. We have worked hard for more than two years to deliver a magnificent event on an extraordinary circuit”, wrote the organisers of the Road World Championships in a press releaseExternal link. The event was scheduled to take place from September 20-27 in Aigle and Martigny, between the western Swiss cantons of Vaud and Valais.  The number of people attending events has been restricted since February 28. This rule was effective until the end of this month but on Wednesday the government announced that major events with more than 1,000 people will only be allowed against starting on October 1. Another factor influencing the decision according to the organising committee was the number of countries subject to quarantine when entering Switzerland. It wrote that this would prevent many of the 1,200 riders from 90 countries from participating in the event. This is also expected to have a significant economic impact on the host region. The director of the Valais hotel association reported that it will lose around 2,500 hotel bookings as a result of the cancellation.

This comes on top of the CHF31 billion in bailout funds approved by parliament since March. The latest batch of funds is to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic in 13 areas. Some CHF288.5 million has been earmarked to pay for Covid-19 testing, but this amount can be offset against funds already allocated for procuring medical equipment, the government announced on Wednesday. Another CHF221.3 million is needed to shore up the national railway system that has seen a huge drop in passenger numbers as a result of the pandemic. Air traffic control company Skyguide requires CHF400 million to make up for lost revenues resulting from reduced air transport. This would come in two tranches of CHF150 million this year, which parliament is being asked to produce now, and a further CHF250 million in 2021. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Council (governing body) indicated its intention to extend the period that workers put on shortened hours can claim insurance for their lost earnings. The government has forecast that the pandemic will cost Switzerland CHF20.9 billion by the end of the year. A greatly reduced tax income will blow an estimated CHF3.1 billion hole in funding for normal expenses. An additional CHF17.8 billion of emergency funding is expected to be spent tackling coronavirus this year. Parliament has approved extraordinary expenditure of CHF30.8 billion, but it appears unlikely that all of this will need to be used. The state is also underwriting up to CHF42 billion in loans for struggling businesses. This is due to be paid back, but the government has budgeted a CHF1 billion loss for this year as some companies are expected to go bust despite the loans. Budget forecasting remains a difficult task as the course of the pandemic until the end of the year is uncertain.
2020-08-12;Swiss to allow mass events from October despite spike in Covid cases;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-to-allow-mass-public-events-from-october/45963608;Switzerland has decided to authorise large-scale public events of more than 1,000 people from the start of October. Sports matches, concerts and other events will have to comply with special measures to combat the threat of coronavirus and apply to cantons for a permit. The number of people attending events has been restricted since February 28. This rule had applied until the end of this month but has now been extended until the end of September. This was done to give the 26 cantons, which have wide-ranging autonomy in Switzerland's decentralised system, more time to put contact tracing systems into place. However, from October 1 events with larger crowds can go ahead provided they meet basic hygiene and social distancing measures, the government announced on Wednesday. More guidelines based on recommendations from the World Health Organisation and the government’s Science Task Force will be announced later. We want to boost cooperation between the federal authorities and the cantons but remain flexible to adapt the rules depending on the situation, said President Simonetta Sommaruga during  a news conference. Interior Minister Alain Berset whose portfolio includes health matters said there are no ready-made solutions and that clear rules must be defined to decide on a case-by-case basis which events will be allowed and under what circumstances.  The government said the lifting of crowd restrictions takes into account “society’s need for a varied programme of cultural and sporting events, as well as economic interests. Not all large-scale events pose the same level of risk. There are large-scale events at which the minimum distance between people can largely be respected.” Events companies, and in particular sports clubs and associations, have been lobbying for crowd restrictions to be lifted, arguing that many clubs and firms would go bust if the 1,000-person limit remains in force for much longer. The move comes despite recommendations by the government's Covid-19 taskforce not to ease the restrictions for mass events. But the government said the restriction will not be lifted if the rate of infections worsens. The number of new cases was 274 on Wednesday, bringing total infections to more than 37,000 since the pandemic broke in Switzerland. More than 1,700 people have died of Covid-19 in Switzerland. Berset stressed that the current situation was  under control . Both he and President Sommaruga appealed on citizens to take added responsibility. The situation could change quickly but we must learn to live with the virus for some time, said Berset.

Most of the jobs to be cut are at shops and the company’s headquarters in the central Swiss city of Lucerne, according to a statement on Wednesday. About 150 positions in other countries will also be affected, notably in the United States where 100 jobs have already been cut. “The global coronavirus crisis and the almost complete collapse of international tourism has hit Bucherer very hard,” a statement said. The absence of Asian tourists in Switzerland since January had led to a massive and continuing slump in turnover. Sales dropped by more than 90% in Lucerne alone and the market had not recovered after shops reopened in May, the company added. Bucherer is pessimistic about future business prospects for the next two years as international tourism is “of vital importance” and because a looming recession, affecting notably the luxury goods sector.

2020-08-12;‘It’s an anti-Europe initiative in disguise’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-it-s-an-anti-europe-initiative-in-disguise-/45946726;"To ensure jobs in Switzerland, relations with the European Union are of central importance, says parliamentarian Daniela Schneeberger. Maintaining the bilateral accords will ensure orderly relations with the EU and thus prosperity for the people of Switzerland, she believes. The initiative to limit immigration from the EU proposes that Switzerland renegotiate free movement of people – and thus also pull out of the other six bilateral accords. It’s an anti-Europe initiative in disguise. This could be fatal particularly in view of a looming recession we are currently facing due to the coronavirus crisis. Switzerland is a prosperous country. Our prosperity is due not just to our own innovation and hard work, but also to our relations with the wider world and an open labour market. We earn every second franc from our access to the outside world, particularly the EU member countries. It is obvious that Switzerland as a small country in the middle of Europe needs a good, well-organised relationship with the EU. The coronavirus crisis has shown the consequences closed borders can have. Cross-border travel is something on which numerous industries and businesses here depend for their survival, ensuring that they can sell their products and get them to their customers. Switzerland has concluded a set of bilateral accords with the EU [more than 20 years ago] – seven of them in total – including the free movement of people agreement. If Switzerland withdraws from one of these accords, it withdraws from all of them – that is how the framework is structured. It is beyond dispute that these bilateral agreements with the EU bring us many advantages. Thanks to them the Swiss economy experienced strong growth in the past few years, and that has meant more jobs and more prosperity for us all. Free movement of people has not had a negative effect on Switzerland’s labour market. We have one of the lowest levels of unemployment, the highest pay rates and the strongest purchasing power in Europe. These orderly relations, which depend on the current bilateral agreements, will also help us to cope better with the coronavirus-based recession due to our guaranteed access to the EU. The initiative to limit immigration, if accepted, would in fact amount to an initiative to withdraw from normal relations with the EU, because it would mean not just the end of free movement of people on both sides; it would mean the end of the whole negotiated package. For Switzerland, that would mean losing EU market access. Small and medium-sized companies in Switzerland have an important role as cross-border suppliers – they depend on the EU. Swiss citizens in the EU also benefit from the free movement of people. Almost 800,000 Swiss live abroad, more than 60% in Europe, mainly France, Germany and Italy. About 500,000 Swiss live and work in the EU and thus benefit from the free movement of people. The end of free movement would hit these people directly, because without this regulation, access to the labour market would dry up. Swiss could not just go and work in another European country – for the long or short term. Keeping intact our relationship with the EU in the form of the bilateral agreements is essential for the economy and our prosperity. There is no good reason to throw the whole package overboard now. The initiative to limit immigration needs to be rejected, especially given the current coronavirus crisis, which goes to show just how important working together with our neighbours and with Europe is.

2020-08-11;Banks braced as pandemic poses biggest test since financial crisis ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/banks-braced-as-pandemic-poses-biggest-test-since-financial-crisis-/45960472; During the depths of the coronavirus crisis in Europe in late March, Sergio Ermotti remembers sitting in his home study in Lugano, reflecting on the latest financial meltdown to engulf his career as a banker. “If I go through my last eight years, we had a lot of mini-earthquakes, but never of the magnitude of what we are seeing now,” the 60-year-old UBS chief executive says. “This is a crisis that is driven by fear in a different way . . . this time it’s not just about people losing their assets or savings, it’s about their life, it’s about their families. It’s so profound, so different.” Switzerland’s largest bank is weathering the crisis relatively well, considering its share price is down only 10 per cent this year, a more modest fall than any other global lender apart from Wall Street’s Morgan Stanley. This is no accident. Both have built wealth management arms that boast more than $2tn of client assets, generating consistent fees from the wealthy and super-rich desperate for advice on how to trade the pandemic. The rest of the industry — particularly those focused on bread and butter lending to small businesses and consumers — are facing their toughest test since the financial crisis of 2008, as untold millions of companies face bankruptcy amid unprecedented global lockdowns and travel bans. Governments and regulators have unleashed trillions of dollars of support measures to prop up the system, ensuring the flow of credit and functioning of markets, and helping households stay afloat with salary supports and repayment holidays. But many of those schemes are set to be withdrawn. Meanwhile, interest rates that were already negative in the eurozone have been slashed to zero in the US and 0.1 per cent in the UK, piling pressure on banks’ already slim lending margins. For the smallest and weakest still struggling to recover from the cataclysm 12 years ago, coronavirus could prove fatal. For the biggest, it portends a period of hand-to-mouth survival — weak profits, no dividends and much lower, or no, bonuses — at a time when most investors had already turned bearish. As ever, Europe’s banks have suffered far more than their US rivals, which have fatter profits to see them through leaner years. Navigating the disruption has been complicated by up to 90 per cent of staff working from home for months on end. “For the large national banks, facing zero interest rates into the foreseeable future and the significant credit exposure, how can one be confident?” asks Bob Diamond, who ran Barclays during the last crisis. “Please explain to me where earnings are coming from?” Vast credit losses are the primary concern. Six months into Covid-19, the numbers are already staggering. The 15-largest US banks have set aside $76bn to cover projected bad debts and their 32-biggest European cousins €56bn, Citigroup data shows. The combined total of $139bn in loan-loss provisions is the highest since the $186bn reached in the second half of 2009, the nadir of the financial crisis that brought down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Using a wider sample of banks, consultants at Accenture warn that the estimated losses from bad debts could rise to $880bn by the end of 2022. Loan-loss provisions have been increased by new global accounting rules — a consequence of the financial crisis — forcing lenders to build reserves well in advance of defaults, particularly in the US where they must now provide for lifetime losses based on the latest economic outlook. Vikram Pandit, Citigroup chief executive between 2007 and 2012, argues that this time like-for-like losses should be lower because consumers learnt from the “tough times” they endured 12 years ago. “They are being quite prudent, they’re using some of this money they’re getting from the government to pay down debt, to reduce their balances, they’re spending a little bit less,” he says. Banks will not bear the full brunt of escalating defaults. The UK government’s emergency small-business lending programme — where as many as half of the “bounce back” loans, with a combined cost of at least £34bn, are not expected to be repaid — puts taxpayers on the line for losses. Payment holidays on credit cards, mortgages and rents are also masking the current stress on loan books. JPMorgan wrote off just $1.6bn of loans in its $998bn lending portfolio in its second-quarter results. The UK’s largest mortgage lender, Lloyds, has so far written off just £10.5m of its £38.4bn small business loan book — far below the average for the past three years — even though executives say bad loans could reach £5.5bn of its overall £440bn loan book this year. “It’s a fool’s game trying to predict the ultimate credit losses from the crisis,” says Jaime Ramos Martin, a fund manager at Aviva Investors, which manages £356bn and is a major shareholder in British banks. “Now more than ever, it’s about picking the business models that are right for the future and sticking with them.” For those with big investment banking operations, a surge in trading revenues derived from historically volatile markets combined with fees from record corporate debt and equity issuance have softened the blow. Morgan Stanley posted its highest-ever revenue for a single quarter, including a market-leading 168 per cent increase in fixed-income trading. Despite big provisions for loan losses and future litigation costs, Goldman Sachs’ net profit held steady for the same reason, until an extra $2bn in provisions for settling the 1MDB legal case wiped out those earnings. However, the trading boom won’t last. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon has warned that markets revenues could halve during the rest of the year. More optimistically, Morgan Stanley’s finance chief Jon Pruzan says that while it is “highly unlikely” to see a repeat of the first-half trading bonanza, it would not be a “bad” end to the year since client activity remains “elevated”. Investors remain sceptical. Uncertainty over loan-losses, concerns over revenues in ultra-low-rate environments and bans on dividends and share buybacks have translated into a mass sell-off of the sector. European bank stocks have plunged 39 per cent this year compared with a 13 per cent fall in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index. In the US, the Nasdaq Bank Index has fallen more than a third, while the S&P 500 is flat for the year. That has wiped out a combined $987bn in shareholder value, Citi data shows. “Banks have fulfilled their role in the macroeconomy this time,” says Philipp Hildebrand, who headed financial stability at the Swiss National Bank in 2008 and is now vice-chairman of BlackRock, the $7.3tn asset manager. “But in Europe at least, they have not performed from a shareholder point of view.” Even the most resilient have not been spared. “I’m feeling a bit exasperated,” admits Thomas Gottstein, chief executive at Credit Suisse, referring to the negative reaction to his bank’s $1.8bn second-quarter profit, up 19 per cent year-on-year. “After these numbers, for our share price to be down?” Investors no longer “differentiate between Swiss, other European banks and the US banks. They throw us all into the same bucket,” he adds. “There is a lot of concern about a second [coronavirus] wave, a W-shaped recovery, another lockdown . . . There’s a lot of cynicism out there.” European banks trade at an average 48 per cent of the book value of their net assets compared with 89 per cent in the US. Centuries-old national champions Barclays (€17.4bn), Deutsche Bank (€15.6bn) and Italy’s UniCredit (€17.2bn) are collectively worth less than Zoom, the $72bn (€61bn) videoconferencing company founded in 2011. France’s Société Générale — with its €1.5tn balance sheet and €3.2bn of profit last year — has seen its share price plunge 60 per cent in 2020 and is now valued at €11bn, less than lossmaking workplace messaging app, Slack, at €14bn. “Things are getting a bit crazy. Economies are in recovery mode, capital and cash positions are very strong and yet bank valuations are worse than in 2009, it beggars belief,” says David Herro, vice-chairman of the $90bn asset manager Harris Associates, which owns top-five stakes in Lloyds, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas. “I have to believe we are at or close to the bottom [of the valuation],” he adds. “It’s not easy keeping faith, but this virus will pass like all before it.” Not all share Mr Herro’s conviction. Bankers’ early optimism that the pandemic would manifest as a sharp economic shock followed by an equally rapid recovery — the ubiquitous “V-shaped” recession — has given way to pessimism. Ana Botín, executive chairman of Santander, the eurozone’s largest lender, said in March that her bank’s earnings could fall as little as 5 per cent this year, in the wake of the pandemic. Four months on, Santander has set aside €7bn to cover loan losses and booked a hefty writedown of its UK business, pushing the Spanish bank to the first quarterly loss in its 163-year history. Barclays’ and HSBC’s second-quarter net income plunged 91 per cent and 96 per cent respectively. In the US, $9.5bn of credit charges — including loan loss provisions — pushed Wells Fargo to a $2.4bn loss, while profit fell more than 50 per cent at Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan. With little prospect of boosting revenues, executives must cut costs to protect already anaemic profits, particularly in Europe. HSBC and Deutsche Bank suspended previously announced redundancies in March, but less than two months later, lay-offs resumed and deeper cuts were promised. “Bank management has been focused on survival until now, avoiding banana skins and appearing socially useful, which they’ve done very well,” says Stuart Graham, founder of Autonomous Research. “But as they come up for air and look to 2021 and 2022, there is a lot of pressure to fundamentally readjust their cost base, organically or through consolidation. If this crisis isn’t the motivation to finally address it, what is?” Fears for the global financial system peaked in mid-March when the $20tn market for US government debt seized up, leading some to envisage a repeat of the bank collapses of 2008 and 2009. But this time, their loss-absorbing buffers held up. “Can you imagine if back then we had Covid?” asks Mr Pandit who now runs the fintech investment group Orogen. “It’s hard to imagine what the outcome would have been for the system.” Davide Serra, co-founder of Algebris, a €13bn asset manager that invests in bank debt and equity, says: “Capital is now five times higher than in 2008, if regulators hadn’t forced it into the system we would have had a real shock.” “If you think even Deutsche Bank can post an operating profit in the second quarter of a pandemic, when it has been one of the biggest loss making banks in history, that shows you how much the industry has changed,” he adds. While painful in the moment, crises often precipitate long-overdue structural changes to stagnant global systems. Ms Botín — who continued a four-generation Spanish banking dynasty stretching back to 1909 when she succeeded her father six years ago — says the recently agreed €750bn European recovery fund will be a “key step” that makes the “prospect of a banking union much more likely to happen”. “In turn, it would open the door to the possibility of cross-border banking consolidation in Europe,” she adds. Follow FT's live coverage and analysis of the global pandemic and the rapidly evolving economic crisis here. The European Central Bank recently pledged to remove some longstanding obstacles to big mergers. In July, Italy’s largest retail lender Intesa Sanpaolo succeeded in a €4.2bn hostile takeover of local rival UBI Banca, marking the largest European banking deal since the financial crisis. Others are not so sanguine about a wave of deals saving the fragmented sector. “Waiting for consolidation is like waiting for Godot, it just doesn’t come,” says Ronit Ghose, head of bank research at Citi. “So instead we face more cost cuts, sadly.” Equally, those most influential in creating the post-crisis regulatory system urge caution, with the pandemic’s fallout set to be a multiyear phenomenon. “The first phase of Covid has been managed well, and what the official sector did was impressive,” says Bill Coen, former head of the Basel committee of international banking regulators. “But we are now approaching the second wave of stress, a tidal wave of credit issues, so it’s far too early to claim victory yet.” As government support schemes are withdrawn and borrowers start to come up short on their loans, banks may have to sacrifice their prized role as the good guys. So far, they have been willing conduits for trillions of government support and largely sympathetic to customers in distress, but that will change. “There is still massive guilt over the last crisis, we used to be the pillars of society and then we became pilloried,” says the chief executive of a big UK bank, who asked not to be named. “Now we want to be the heroes, save the economy and be knighted when it’s over.” “However, we will reach a point where the debt has to be collected and then the tough choices will start,” he adds. “A lot of these companies are going to go bankrupt, we’ll have to write the debt off and that will be painful. It’ll be difficult to be the heroes then.” Vikram Pandit is chairman and CEO of Orogen and not chairman of TGG as stated in an earlier caption Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020 © 2020 The Financial Times Ltd.

2020-08-11;Switzerland buys access to potential Covid-19 treatment drug;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-buys-access-to-potential-covid-19-treatment-drug/45960120;The Swiss government has signed an agreement with a Zurich company for priority access to a drug being developed to treat those severely ill with Covid-19. The deal with the Molecular Partners firm gives Switzerland access to the first 200,000 doses of the medicine, as well as up to three million further doses when requested, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) announcedExternal link on Tuesday. The deal is worth several million francs, the Keystone-SDA news agency reported. The immunotherapeutic agent, currently in development, is “comparable to mixtures of antibody therapies that are used to neutralise the virus”, the FOPH wrote. If approved, it would mainly be used to treat people already infected with Covid-19, although it could also be administered to risk groups as a prophylactic. Clinical trials of the drug are planned for Autumn 2020. The deal is another leg of the government’s anti-coronavirus strategy. It has also put aside CHF300 million ($329 million) for the procurement of a vaccine, and last week announced the pre-purchase of up to 4.5 million doses of a drug being developed by US firm Moderna.
2020-08-10;Swiss businesses weather Covid crisis well so far;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-businesses-weather-covid-crisis-well-so-far/45958972;Researchers say the government’s economic support has been a key factor in avoiding a wave of bankruptcies in Switzerland despite the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 20% fewer companies went out of business between March and July than in the same period last year, the KOF Economic Institute said on Monday. “The number of bankruptcies has not been significantly higher than expected in any major region or sector of the economy,” a statement said. The researchers noted that even the hospitality sector and the entertainment industry have been affected “very little”. However, the economic downturn was evident across all major regions of the country, but to varying degrees, the institute said. One reason for the generally low level of bankruptcies could be the support measures taken by the government to soften the impact of the coronavirus crisis. They included easier access to a compensation scheme for short working hours, a massive lending programme and a ban on debt collection which were put in place at the beginning of April. However, the authors of the study – the KOF instituteExternal link of the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the digital business information company, Bisnode – warn it is too early to sound the all-clear. They say some bankruptcies might simply have been postponed and experience in previous crises shows that the incidence of bankruptcies increases gradually rather than abruptly. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate in Switzerland remained stable at 3.2% in July. About 148,900 people were registered as unemployed according to the State Sectretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). That slightly fewer than in June, but more than 1% higher than in July 2019. Boris Zürcher, head of the labour unit at SECO said an initial increase in the number of jobless people in March slowed down since April. Zürcher also said he did not expect a massive wave of layoffs later this year.
2020-08-10;Pension reform initiative runs out of steam at early stage;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pension-reform-initiative-runs-out-of-steam-at-early-stage/45958268;A people’s initiative aimed at overhauling Switzerland’s occupational pension scheme will not come to a nationwide vote. The campaigners announced they had failed to collect the required minimum number of signatures and saw no chances of doing so by the deadline in early October. “Without any doubt I have been miscalculating a few things. The coronavirus did the rest for us,” said the main promoter of the initiative. Josef Bachmann said citizens were aware of the flaws in the current system, but under the restrictions imposed to fight the pandemic, it was much more difficult to approach people in the streets to ask them for their signatures. His committeeExternal link, which includes mainly right-wing and centre-right politicians, wanted to introduce a flexible minimum interest rate on the accumulated pension capital, doing away with the current rate of 6.8%. The mandatory occupational pension scheme is part of Switzerland’s three-tier social security system, but experts have warned that the growing number of older people is putting the onus on the young generation to finance pensions. Another proposal to amend the occupational pension system aimed at helping employees over the age of 50 was withdrawn last year. The initiative of the Workfair 50+ groupExternal link had called for pension laws to be changed to make workplace pension fund contributions the same for everyone, regardless of age. The lobby group said parliament had taken steps to address the issue with a legal amendment rather than a constitutional reform.
2020-08-10;How can schools best protect pupils during corona times?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/teachers-call-for-better-protection-measures-at-schools/45957928;"Swiss teachers have warned that the new school year will be heavily marked by the coronavirus. The key issues: masks, policing pupils' quarantine and what to do about the educational gap made worse by nationwide school closures earlier this year. “Even if the school year is starting in a regular way, we have to be prepared for further school closures,” Switzerland’s two main teaching associations said on Monday at a joint press conference in the capital Bern. Health is a top priority, they underlined. Their comments came as pupils in eleven cantons started back at school; the rest of the country will be following on over the next few weeks. Lessons should be learned from the last school year to ensure adequate protection measures at schools over the next terms,  the German-speaking Federation of Swiss Teachers LCH and its French-speaking counterpart SER said. In particular they called for more coordination among the cantons, which are in charge of educational matters - which can be seen in the fact that some cantons have opted for masks for older pupils this term and others not - and for teaching associations to be included in the federal authorities’ decision-making process. On March 13, the Swiss government took the unprecedented step of ordering the nationwide closure of all schools in the country, overriding the cantons’ authority. Whereas primary schools mostly went back to class teaching after re-opening on May 11, older pupils in post-compulsory schooling (vocational and baccalaureate schools) were only allowed back in small numbers from June 8. Many continued with distance learning. All eyes are currently on how cantons, back in charge of schools since the lockdown ended, will manage the situation for the autumn term. Concerns have been raised of a possible spike in coronavirus cases after the holidays as pupils return from trips abroad, including countries on Switzerland’s “risk list”External link, with travellers having to quarantine for ten days upon return. Older pupils will also be going back to full-time teaching. Several cantons have already told teachers not to “police” pupils about where they went on their holidays. Keeping to quarantine is a parental responsibility, they argue. However, some schools  have said that they will send children home if it is ascertained that they have not kept to quarantine, but only after having consulted the parents. Hygiene measures like hand-washing and social distancing will still apply at all schools in the next term. But while there will generally be no mask wearing in primary schools (younger pupils are not considered primary transmitters of the virus in Switzerland), several cantons will require masks to be worn among post-compulsory pupils, aged 15-16, when social distancing of at least 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. This will be the case across the French-speaking part of Switzerland, which has announced a coordinated approach to mask-wearing among older pupils. The German-speaking cantons have no such coordination in place, although some cantons, like Lucerne and Bern, will insist on masks. This piecemeal approach has already been criticised by teaching unions.  On Monday, teachers called for a professionalisation of health risk management in schools, including the training and installation of health protection officers. Also of great concern is the educational gap – a long-standing problem in Switzerland, with pupils of well-educated parents more likely to progress academically than those from more disadvantaged backgrounds – which widened during the lockdown, teachers said. An estimated one-fifth of pupils fell through the remote learning net during school closures, as swissinfo.ch previously reported. The reasons given were a lack of motivation and/or lack of support and resources, such as a computer or quiet place to work, at home. There must be a long-term focus on pupils who fells behind during the lockdown or who developed psychological questions during this time, the teachers' organisations said. This will need targeted resources which must be available during the whole school year, they said. This includes access to school social workers, early language learning and wide-ranging daycare facilities around schools, also in more rural areas, the teachers added. Many primary schools in particular require pupils to go home for lunch and do not have afternoon school. Meanwhile the southern Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, which was particularly hard hit by the coronavirus due to its proximity to Italy, has been outlining its plans for the autumn term. It was the first canton to announce it was to close its schools even before the nationwide lockdown - and is the last canton to reopen them fully. On Monday, officials said External linkthey were in favour of schools reopening on August 31, but with no obligation for pupils to wear masks, at all levels of school (although this may change for older pupils.depending on developments). Teachers will have to wear masks in public areas like corridors and staff rooms, but it won't be compulsory inside classrooms."
2020-08-09;Sports clubs want fans returning to matches;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sports-clubs-want-fans-returning-to-matches/45956832;Sporting associations and clubs are lobbying the authorities to allow crowds to return to matches. The government will next week examine lifting a 1,000-person limit on public gatherings, according to two newspapers. Sports bodies, led by football and ice hockey, are warning the death of clubs unless crowd limits are eased. Both the SonntagsZeitung and NZZ am Sonntag report that on Wednesday the government will look into safety concepts that could allow this to happen at matches. A decision is not expected until later this month. Several clubs are reported to have presented their plans of how to safely increase crowds. The measures include abolishing standing areas for fans, ticketing procedures that keep track of people attending matches, compulsory mask wearing and closing down food and drink stalls at stadiums. “You can no longer justify permitting dance and cultural events with several hundred participants, where coronavirus measures may be less strictly observed than in large stadiums with a reduced number of spectators,” Marc Lüthi, managing director of the Bern ice hockey club, told the SonntagsZeitung. “We want a safety concept that allows more than 1,000 fans to attend matches. This is a matter that concerns our very existence,” Swiss Ice Hockey League director Denis Vaucher told NZZ am Sonntag. The media reports that some government ministers are sympathetic to the cause of sports clubs. Health minister Alain Berset confirmed to the NZZ am Sonntag that the government is looking into the issue but warned against expecting a return to pre-pandemic “normality”. “There will be no full stadiums without restrictions,” he said. “The regulations will depend on the type of activity. An exhibition event lasting several days is different from a concert or football match, where thousands of people come together for a few hours.”
2020-08-09;Coronavirus has frayed Swiss nerves: interior minister;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-has-frayed-swiss-nerves--health-minister/45956766;Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset says the mood of the nation has become more irritable with the realisation that coronavirus is not going away anytime soon. His ministry has come under fire for getting its numbers wrong about the pandemic.   Berset told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper that the spirit of national togetherness, observed at the start of the crisis, is starting to unravel. “At the beginning, many people thought that the situation would soon get back to normal,” he said. “It is dragging on with no end in immediate sight. A fatigue has set in.” “Then came some false numbers - a regrettable mistake - and criticism rains down.” The false numbers were contained in a recent health office claim that two-thirds of Covid-19 cases could be traced to bars, clubs and restaurants. It later admitted that the virus was mainly transmitted through families and that hospitality venues were responsible for far fewer cases.    Berset said tempers are being worn thin by the continued threat of Covid-19 that has forced the authorities to keep restrictions on public life in place. “Life has changed and become more uncertain,” he said. “There is less close contact and that is less fun. We will all be happy when it is over.” Berset could not say when the pandemic will be over, but said the goal was to avoid a similar situation to March when it threatened to spiral out of control. He denied that cantons and the federal council (central government) were at odds about how to proceed. But he added that there should be a better system for coordinating data from the 26 cantonal health authorities. One long-term measure is to vaccinate the population against Covid-19. This week, the government ordered 4.5 million doses of a vaccine from the US biotech firm Moderna. Berset said this would cover two million of the most vulnerable members of the population and added that other orders are pending. 
2020-08-07;Canton Zurich collects 'risk land' passenger data for other cantons;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/canton-zurich-collects--risk-land--passenger-data-for-other-cantons/45954836; Zurich cantonal police sends passenger data on people flying into Zurich airport from countries on Switzerland’s coronavirus “risk list” to several other cantons, it has been revealed. Canton Zurich has been collecting the data from airlines since Wednesday in order to check that people are keeping to the 10-day quarantine rules. Since July 6 anyone entering Switzerland from a country or area with an increased risk of infection must spend ten days in voluntary quarantine and report their arrival to the relevant cantonal authority within two days. The list of 46 countries can be found hereExternal link. On Wednesday mainland Spain was added to the list. Anyone who fails to comply with this obligation to report risks a fine of up to CHF10,000 ($11,000). In the case of negligent infringement, the maximum fine is CHF5,000.  Zurich cantonal police spokesman Werner Schaub confirmed to news agency Keystone-SDA a report in Tages-Anzeiger newspaperExternal link which stated that the data had been going to cantons Bern and Aargau since Friday. Canton Thurgau has also expressed an interest in the data. A cantonal government official told Keystone-SDA that the number of people needing to go into quarantine had doubled every week during the summer holidays. Zurich’s cantonal security director Mario Fehr said on Wednesday that the canton would be collecting the data and that it was prepared to hand it on to other cantons. Fehr said that he made the decision independently because of having to wait too long for the federal government to organise the data. By Wednesday, 8,600 travellers had arrived in Zurich from risk countries of which 15% lived in the canton, officials said. It was also revealed on Friday that Slovenia had put Switzerland on its yellow listExternal link, meaning an obligatory quarantine of 14 days for all those coming in from Switzerland, unless they were Slovenian citizens or permanent residents. Norway also put Switzerland - as well as France and the Czech Republic - on its red list of quarantine countries on Thursday due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in those countries, its public health institute said.
2020-08-07;Cantons divided over mask requirement for older pupils;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cantons-divided-over-mask-requirement-for-older-pupils/45954454; Older pupils should wear face masks at school if they cannot keep to social distancing, several cantons announced on Friday. But the situation across the country varies. Schools in eleven cantons across Switzerland will reopen after the summer holidays on Monday, August 10 – with others following over the rest of the month – which has led to a flurry of announcements on Friday over which anti-corona measures are to be enforced. In Switzerland, cantons are in charge of educational matters and, therefore, anti-corona measures in schools. Whereas most primary and lower secondary schools have been open in some form since May 11 – when the nationwide lockdown ended – upper secondary schools were only allowed to reopen on June 8 under strict hygiene measures. Many continued with a mix of distance learning and smaller group lessons in school until the summer holidays. All eyes are now on how these schools, whose pupils are aged 15 and older, will manage the autumn term. Full classroom teaching can take place in upper secondary schools if hygiene measures are respected, the Intercantonal Conference of Public Education for French and Italian-speaking Switzerland said on FridayExternal link, setting out its member cantons’ coordinated plan. This includes older pupils and staff wearing masks if social distancing of 1.5 metres cannot be respected, the organisation wrote. This move was welcomedExternal link by the Union of French-speaking teachers (SER), which has been calling for a uniform approach to schools’ coronavirus measures. Cantons Geneva, Vaud and Valais made official announcements on their policy on Friday. Bilingual Canton Bern also saidExternal link it would also follow the masks and social distancing line. Among the German-speaking cantons, Lucerne (the first to announce such measures, and the strictest), Aargau, Schaffhausen and Basel Country have already said they would require masks for pupils aged 15 or older when social distancing of at least 1.5 metres is not possible (2.25m2 per person in a classroom in Aargau). But there is no planned mask requirement in upper secondary schools in cantons Zurich, Basel City, St Gallen, Graubünden, Thurgau, Zug, Obwalden, Schwyz, Solothurn, Uri and Appenzell Outer Rhodes, according to the Keystone-SDA news agency. Some of these cantons, such as Basel City and Graubünden, have however recommended the wearing of masks during laboratory lessons, where it is hard to keep to the 1.5 metres distance. Primary and lower secondary schools (which together make up compulsory schooling in Switzerland) are so far exempt from any mandatory mask wearing. The differing approach among the cantons has come under criticism from teachers. Dagmar Rösler, president of the Federation of Swiss Teachers, said she felt there was a large acceptance for obligatory mask wearing. It is hard to enforce social distancing in class and masks would help to make the situation less tense when classrooms are full, she told Swiss public television SRFExternal link. Lucius Hartmann, president of the Swiss Association of Baccalaureate School Teachers, was also in favour of making masks mandatory at upper secondary level, even if it impacted lessons. “It will be harder to communicate and after seven hours in a mask, your concentration is not the same,” he told SRF. But the advantage of being more relaxed in class outweighed this, he said.
2020-08-07;Swiss scientists to develop detector for rapid Covid screening;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-scientists-to-develop-detector-for-rapid-covid-screening/45954264; A project to develop a small portable device to detect the coronavirus in airports, railway stations and public spaces where rapid screening could contribute to early detection of the disease has been awarded a Swiss National Science Foundation grant. “There is an urgent need for a set of measures to control the spread of the virus, reduce the severity of the disease in infected patients and ultimately prevent infection with effective vaccines,” said the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)’s Sandrine Gerber, who is leading the research. “With a low-cost and highly sensitive biosensor, we are proposing an approach to overcome the limitations of current testing procedures, which should eliminate the need for biomedical staff and specialized laboratory infrastructure,” she said in an EPFL statement on FridayExternal link.  Also participating in the project is Igor Stefanini from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) und Francesco Bertoni from Università della Svizzera italiana (USI). The detector project is one of two from the EPFL to be awarded a grant. The other involves large-scale serological profiling of Covid-19 using high-throughput microfluidic immunological nano-assays, the statement said. In all, 28 new coronavirus research projects have been funded under the SNSF Covid-19 National Research Programme launched on April 30 to “advance our understanding of the coronavirus disease 2019”.  Total grants were worth CHF18.6 million ($20.3 million), the SNSF saidExternal link earlier this week.
2020-08-06;How have Swiss apprentices fared during the pandemic?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-have-swiss-apprentices-fared-during-the-pandemic-/45950550;Thousands of teenagers started apprenticeships in Switzerland this week. The latest statistics show that 90% of training places have been filled, countering fears of a ‘corona shock’ – for now. Around two-thirds of young people opt for vocational training in Switzerland versus attending university. School-leavers usually sign contracts for apprenticeships that start in the first week of August (which combine on-the-job-training with vocational school). However, educators have expressed concern that young people might fail to find a training place due to the lockdown in March and April this year and the economic impact of the coronavirus. In May the government set up a taskforceExternal link to tackle the issue. But according to the Apprenticeship Pulse research projectExternal link, the situation is looking up. (The project is a cooperation between the largest apprenticeship jobs platform Yousty.chExternal link and the Chair of Education Systems at Switzerland’s Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zurich).External link Results published on Thursday show that by July, 90% of places for August 2020 had been filled. “The situation is not as bad as expected, which is very pleasing,” Yousty.ch’s Domenica Mauch told swissinfo.ch by email. “But we should remain cautious, we must carefully observe the long-term effect of Covid-19 on the economy and vocational training. That’s why we will continue the survey until at least next April.” There are several reasons for the better-than-expected results, Mauch says. “One is that the Swiss economy is clearly supporting the dual training system and promotion of the young workforce… and there is a lot being done by the government’s taskforce and from the industry associations to support companies.” Efforts by the taskforce include working with the cantons to set up “last-minute apprenticeship places platforms” for open positions and extending the deadline for apprenticeship contract signing until autumn. The Apprenticeship Pulse results are similar to those from the government taskforce which reported earlier this month that 55,000 apprenticeship training contracts had been signed by the end of June – just 3% fewer than in June 2019. But there are regional differences. Swiss public television SRF reportedExternal link in late July that the number of signed contracts was down by 17% on 2019 in the French-speaking canton of Vaud, with canton Geneva reporting a 24% drop on last year. The reason? Timing. In the German-speaking part of Switzerland the application process for new apprenticeships starts the previous August, so many contracts are signed early. But in the French and Italian-speaking part of the country, the process only starts in spring – exactly during this year’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown. Attitudes towards apprenticeships also differ regionally, perhaps contributing to the gulf in the number of signed contracts. “Apprenticeships have a kind of social stigma among the academic elite in the western part of Switzerland: it’s something for the less able students. In the German-speaking part, apprenticeships have a high social prestige, also in business,” economist Rudolf Strahm told Swiss Public Broadcaster SRF. Help is at hand in some areas. Canton Geneva is currently offering training bonuses to companies that hire apprentices and has extended the contract signing deadline until November. The Italian-speaking canton of Ticino recently announced similar measures. But what of those young people in the midst of their two-to-four-year apprenticeships? The coronavirus lockdown saw many companies close down or scale back operations, including vocational training. While just 64% of apprentices were able to train in April, the Apprenticeship Pulse survey found that by July, 91% of apprentices were back working in their training companies under government-recommended hygiene measures. Only 0.3% of current apprentices are not receiving any kind of on-the-job training due to company closures, it noted. Those coming to the end of their training, who have already faced the difficulty of finishing the qualifications under the pandemic situation, are now looking for their first jobs in an economy suffering its worst downturn in decades. Some will stay on at the companies they trained with, but this number is expected to fall by 16%, the survey found. 
2020-08-06;Swiss International Air Lines’ turnover halved due to coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-international-airlines--turnover-halved-due-to-coronavirus/45950736;The economic repercussions of the coronavirus have caused turnover at SWISS to fall by 55% in the first half of 2020.  With a turnover of CHF1.17 billion ($1.28 billion) between January and the end of June, the carrier suffered an operating loss of CHF266.4 million in the first half of the year, following an operating profit of CHF245.3 million a year earlier. At the same time, the number of passengers fell by 64% to 3.2 million, the company announced on Thursday.   The airline was already hit hard by the spread of Covid-19 and travel restrictions in the first quarter of 2020, when it posted an operating loss of CHF84.1 million, following an operating profit of CHF48.3 million a year earlier.  The situation is not likely to improve any time soon. On Wednesday, CEO Thomas Klühr warned that the company was still losing a massive amount of money and a return to profitable flights was likely to take time.  The carrier has significantly reduced its losses since the end of the containment measures: currently the company is losing less than CHF1 million per day, compared with CHF3 million per day at the height of the crisis, said Klühr in an interview with Swiss newspaper 20 Minuten.  Against this background, the regular flight plan will take longer to resume than expected, but Klühr is “optimistic” that the situation will improve by the summer of 2021.  On Thursday, Swiss International Air Lines’ parent company Lufthansa reported a net loss of €3.6 billion for the first six months of the year. In the second half of the year, the German group again expects a negative operating result despite an uptake in business. 
2020-08-05;Mainland Spain added to Swiss list of coronavirus risk countries;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mainland-spain-added-to-swiss-list-of-coronavirus-risk-countries/45949176;The Swiss health authorities have decided to add mainland Spain and six other nations to its list of coronavirus risk countries. People entering Switzerland from these countries have to go into quarantine for ten days to help curb the spread of Covid-19. The measure will take effect from Saturday, said Patrick Mathys, head of crisis management for the Federal Office of Public Health. The other countries added are The Bahamas, Singapore, Equatorial Guinea, Sint Maarten, Romania, and São Tomé and Príncipe. Spain’s Balearic and Canary Islands were excluded from the measure and three countries – Russia, Azerbaijan and the United Arab Emirates – were removed from the 46-country risk listExternal link. Spain is a major holiday destination for Swiss tourists and there is a considerable Spanish diaspora in Switzerland. The health office also announced that pregnant women would now be considered part of the group of vulnerable people. It called on them to avoid close contact with other people and observe the hygiene rules. Scientific evidence proved that the health of pregnant women, but also the unborn, could be at risk in case of infections, said Virginie Masserey of the health office. Mathys confirmed that Switzerland was about to sign a deal to secure access to a vaccine being developed by the United States company Moderna. He refused to give further details, but he said the deal would put Switzerland in pole position worldwide for the distribution of the vaccine produced by the Swiss-based biotech firm Lonza. The health office also announced that 2.15 million people – 25% of residents in Switzerland – had downloaded a Covid tracing app launched six weeks ago. In addition, officials said they hoped to boost cooperation between the national and the 26 cantonal health authorities by the end of next month. The aim is to improve the quality of data collection and data exchange, notably to identify the source of Covid-19 infections. “The overall situation in Switzerland has stabilised compared with the previous week,” Mathys said, “but it remains critical.”
2020-08-05;Belgium takes cantons Valais and Vaud off its Covid risk list;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/belgium-takes-cantons-valais-and-vaud-off-its-covid-risk-list/45948110;Switzerland says Belgium has pledged to remove two Swiss regions from its list of coronavirus risk countries following an intervention by the foreign ministry. Cantons Valais and Vaud will again be declared safe as of Wednesday, but canton Geneva will remain on the list, according to Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis. He said he was relieved about the Belgian move and wished all Belgian tourists happy holidays in Switzerland. Valais and Vaud are particularly popular travel destinations. The three regions were blacklisted on Saturday, prompting protests from the cantonal governments and calls for the Swiss foreign ministry to contact the Belgian authorities. It is still not clear what criteria the Belgian government applied for its ban, but people were told they must not travel to the specified regions and those returning to Belgium must be tested for the virus and go into quarantine. Last month the southern canton of Ticino was briefly put on a Belgian travel warning list.
2020-08-04;Media slam ‘Federal Office of Cock-ups’ for Covid data confusion;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/media-slam--federal-office-of-cock-ups--for-covid-data-mix-up/45945870;"Swiss newspapers have not minced their words after the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) admitted getting its numbers seriously wrong about the source of coronavirus infections. The papers are calling for the office’s new management to get its act together. On Friday the health office claimed that two-thirds of Covid-19 cases could be traced to bars, clubs and restaurants. On Sunday it said Covid-19 was actually mainly transmitted through family (27.2%), followed by the workplace (8.7%) and private parties (3%). Nightclubs and dance clubs accounted for only 1.9% of contracted cases; bars and restaurants for 1.6%. Health minister Alain Berset told the Swiss public broadcaster SRF that there would be consequences for the way the ministry is organised, but added that the mistake was corrected quickly. “The Federal Office of Cock-ups” is how the normally staid Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) referred to the FOPH in its editorial. “The goof with the infection figures of clubs and bars is embarrassing and shows that once again the FOPH has been overwhelmed by the coronavirus crisis,” it said. “Even though the number of infected people is now increasing again, Switzerland has come through the coronavirus crisis pretty well so far. But the longer the crisis lasts, the more the question arises as to whether this has been achieved because of the FOPH – or despite it.” The NZZ said a federal office “can’t afford such sloppiness”. “These are highly relevant figures. They directly influence the political discourse about which measures against Covid-19 are particularly urgent in which areas.” The paper said it was understandable that the FOPH was sometimes overwhelmed by the force of the pandemic – “it’s the same for most institutions and companies”. It added that the health office does not determine the country’s coronavirus policy on its own – political responsibility lies with the government and particularly with the cantonal authorities. “Nevertheless, it is grave indeed that the FOPH is repeatedly not up to the task,” it said, citing the example of the toing and froing about making face masks compulsory. The editorial concluded with a call for the health office to sort itself out. “Pascal Strupler has been in charge of the FOPH for ten years. During the pandemic he’s mostly kept his head down, leaving the stage to Daniel Koch [former head of communicable diseases at the FOPH] and his successor Stefan Kuster. This is probably also because Strupler had already announced his departure last autumn, making him a ‘lame duck’. In October political scientist Anne Lévy takes over the post. Her number one goal must be to pull the FOPH out of its torpor.” In French-speaking Switzerland Le Temps shared the NZZ’s concerns, adding that the government’s new statistics aren’t credible any more. “Whom to believe? This weekend the Federal Office of Public Health published a correction stating that the coronavirus is not transmitted in nightclubs but in families. On Sunday evening, however, Mauro Poggia, head of the Geneva department of safety, employment and health, explained that his canton had closed nightclubs on the basis of its own figures. Between the cantons and the FOPH, the confusion is total,” the paper wrote. “This new blunder, coming after the controversy over whether healthy people need to wear a mask, is therefore damaging the FOPH’s already tarnished reputation.” Le Temps quoted Philippe Eggimann, president of the Medical Society of French-speaking Switzerland. “This is dramatic,” he said, “because, standing on the threshold of a probable second wave, Switzerland needs a credible administration on which political decisions can be based. Otherwise, it’s the work of the government itself that is discredited.” For the Tages Anzeiger in Zurich the affair was more than just a great embarrassment for the FOPH. “Its handling of numbers is negligent,” it said in an editorial. “The cantons, which are responsible for restrictions, including closures, depend on reliable figures from the government. The fact that FOPH director Pascal Strupler rebuked the cantons on Friday for failing to take their responsibilities seriously is therefore a mockery,” it said. “Above all, however, there’s a risk of a loss of confidence among the public. If the supposedly rational arguments for restrictions can no longer be trusted, the protective measures will lose support. They are then much more difficult to implement. This was already demonstrated by the FOPH’s unsuccessful communication concerning masks.” The Tages-Anzeiger also said Anne Lévy must give a greater priority to communication than her predecessor, “who in recent months has been responsible for quite a few communication breakdowns”."
2020-08-03;Covid-19: Leading expert assures Geneva ‘under control’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/leading-expert-assures-geneva--under-control-/45944296;Despite the immediate closure of all nightclubs following a spike in coronavirus cases linked to the establishments, Didier Pittet, head of infection prevention at Geneva’s University Hospital, said the situation was under control. While Geneva recorded a sharp riseExternal link in cases during the last week of July, Pittet, one of the country’s leading specialists in infectious diseases said the canton was among those “where screening is most active”. Pittet was speaking on Monday at an online news conference with the Association of Accredited Correspondents at the United Nations (ACANU) in Geneva. “It is not considered to be a hotspot,” he added. “It is certainly under control.” Geneva, which has been to date the second hardest hit canton in total number of cases of Covid-19 after neighbouring Vaud, reportedExternal link 235 confirmed active cases during the week ending 30 July, an increase from 87 confirmed cases the previous week. Zurich, the canton with the second highest number of active cases, recorded 150 cases the last week of July, when Switzerland had a total of 820 active cases. Pittet said that 40% of cases in Geneva were linked to discotheques and bars, 25%-30% to transmission within families and approximately a quarter to infection that had originated outside of Switzerland. Nearly half of newly confirmed cases are among young people and adults. “When you have good epidemiological evidence, you can know where cases are coming from,” he said. Following the closure of the nightclubs, Pittet expected such data to shift as people return from holidays abroad. “Autumn will not be easy,” the professor said, given an expected rise in other respiratory syndromes, including the seasonal flu. Certain social and economic activities, for instance religious gatherings or work done in small, closed quarters, may have to suspended to avoid a return to tighter confinement conditions, he said. But while some international public health experts, drug executives and politicians have expressed the possibility of having a vaccine against the virus in the final months of 2020, Pittet was much more cautious. “There is no chance to have a vaccine before the end of the year. Maybe, if we are lucky there may be a vaccine available by spring,” Pittet said. Last week, Russia announced it would start a mass coronavirus vaccine campaign in October, while  the authorities in the United States and pharmaceutical executives predicted vaccines may come that month.External link Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that a clinical trial underway will lead to an effective vaccine. Christian Baumann of the University of Bern for his part spoke of vaccinating the Swiss population in October.  And for Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset one thing is certain. “The Swiss population should have the fastest possible access to a safe, effective vaccine. But we also know there’s a big, global discussion going on, and need will be huge worldwide. All countries should have fair access to a vaccine.” “Until everyone may benefit from the vaccine, it will take another 18 months or even two years,” Pittet cautioned. “It is unfair to say but there will be places that will be covered quicker than others.”
2020-08-03;How will the pandemic influence Switzerland’s upcoming votes?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-will-the-pandemic-influence-switzerland-s-upcoming-votes-/45932372;"The coronavirus has pushed Switzerland – like most countries – into a new normal, including in the realm of politics. With five issues up for a national vote in September, the pandemic has influenced to varying degrees the practice of voting and campaigning as well as voters’ attitudes towards the issues. Parliament cut short its spring session as the pandemic broke, unable to guarantee social distancing. The federal government took control of the crisis response, only recently handing back power to the cantons. And national votes, planned for May, were postponed. Now that the democratic practice of regular votes is set to resume on September 27, to what extent will Covid-19 continue to loom over the process and the results?   The Federal Chancellery, responsible for the coordination of national votes, makes just two short mentions of Covid-19 in the official instructionsExternal link it sent to cantonal authorities on July 1. It writes that cantons should ensure postal voting material is sent to Swiss living outside the country sooner rather than later, since “dispatches abroad might take longer to arrive due to the pandemic”. Then, it simply says that hygiene and social distancing rules should be heeded when it comes to organising the votes. Beat Furrer of the Federal Chancellery says the sparse guidelines were arrived at after consultation with the cantons in June. “If the number of cases stabilise and the protective measures were maintained at current levels, then the cantons did not see any significant risks or challenges with regard to the proper implementation of the vote,” he says. Even before the pandemic, he adds, 90% of votes in many cantons were submitted by post in any case – something that won’t be overly impacted by Covid-19 measures. At the cantonal level, Alexander Locher from the Zurich Justice Department says it’s still too early to foresee what the virus situation will look like in September. Like many things these days, it’s a case of seeing how the numbers develop. Canton Bern said it hadn’t finished planning whether any special measures were to be taken. In small canton Glarus meanwhile, a unique voting system calls for unique measures: at its upcoming open-air assembly – a mass outdoor vote attended by up to 9,000 citizens – masks will be mandatory, and everyone participating will have their temperature taken. If it’s higher than 38°C, they will be asked to go home. As for campaigning, political life is currently fairly quiet in Switzerland; it’s the summer break, many are on holidays, and next to no vote posters are to be seen in the streets of Bern. Mark Balsiger, a seasoned vote watcher now running the “Courage Civil” campaign against the upcoming initiative to limit immigration from the European Union, says this is normal – debates will start heating up in mid-August, before peaking in early September, he says. But although there has been a massive increaseExternal link in media consumption during the pandemic, Balsiger says people’s  attention has been very much focused on the disease and its countermeasures, rather than issues up for a vote in September. This might mean citizens are less aware of the stakes, especially when it comes to the anti-immigration initiative, he says. Balsiger remembers the historic decision in 1992 – when Switzerland narrowly rejected joining the European Economic Area – and in 2014, when another anti-immigration idea was narrowly approved. On both occasions, campaigning and media coverage had been ramping up long before the votes, which attracted large turnouts – especially in 1992. However, he and his team are largely sticking to their usual campaign approach. Switzerland is not a country of mass political rallies, and the method remains mainly one of digital promotion, targeted email campaigns, and posters put up in public places like train stations – nothing that Covid-19 will affect. Nor does Balsiger plan to use Covid-19 as a hook. The pandemic and the lack of media coverage “has not benefited either side more than the other,” he says – and it doesn’t need to be a major issue. The government, which re-launched its campaign against the initiative in June, is also focussing its argument on the importance of economic links between Switzerland and the EU. So far, those in favour of the initiative haven’t massively latched onto Covid-19 as an argument  either. The Swiss People’s Party, the idea’s main sponsor, has so far stuck to its frequently argued position of wanting to prevent over-population. The pandemic is not mentioned anywhere in the party’s 15 main argumentsExternal link for the initiative. The Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland, the other main group supporting the vote, makes just one mention of Covid-19 on its website. It concludes that the “coronavirus crisis” (quotation marks theirs) clearly shows how the free movement agreement with the EU is “the wrong approach”. If the virus is not (yet) a major campaign plank, this isn’t to say it won’t have an impact on voter mood and behaviour. Political analyst Nenad Stojanović wonders whetherExternal link a new “sense of insecurity” will boost the chances of voters accepting the CHF6 billion purchase of new fighter jets, also up for a vote on September 27. He also reckons the lockdown has raised the importance – actual and symbolic – of borders for the population. “We could thus easily imagine that the [immigration] initiative has a better chance in September than it had in May,” he writes. But he also says the sudden retraction of open borders this spring may have highlighted the benefits of free movement, with many voters perhaps more likely to see the People’s Party idea as a step backwards. They may also be wary of doing anything to harm the economy at such a sensitive time. Stefanie Walter, a University of Zurich professor, supports this second hypothesis. As part of her “Mass politics of disintegration” project, she surveyed the Swiss population both before and during Covid-19 and found that support for the initiative lost ground during the pandemic. In November 2019, the for-against split was 40.3% vs 59.7%; by May 2020, it had widened to 37.6 vs 62.4%. Walter says it’s unclear whether Covid-19 had a direct influence on these results. However, her data does indicate that the Swiss are happy with their government (82.1% say so) and how it has handled the pandemic. They are also still quite happy with the economy (62.1%), despite the impact of the lockdown. So, when it comes to Europe, the researcher expects voters will be wary of big change. “The crisis has highlighted that people like the status quo” and “are happy with what they have”, Walter says – observations backed up by psychological surveysExternal link done during the pandemic, which found that positive emotions of satisfaction and gratitude among the population increased more strongly than negative feelings of powerlessness and fear. Walter believes that when it comes to Europe, all this suggests that “the Swiss don’t want to burn the bridge to a status quo which has so far worked fantastically for them”. Balsiger, the campaign strategist, is on the same page –literally. The posters which his team unveiled last week feature the image of a gloomy-looking and collapsing bridge, underneath the slogan “breaking bridges to Europe? No”. Along with much of the anti-anti-immigration camp, he is banking on voters reinforcing Swiss pragmatism and change-aversion during the pandemic. “Because of Covid-19, there is no time for experimentation,” he says."

It says most occur through contact with family members. On July 31, the FOPH told the Swiss public broadcaster, SRF, that nearly two thirds of Covid-19 cases can be traced to bars, clubs and restaurants. However, on Sunday evening, the office announced that Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through family (27.2%), followed by the workplace (8.7%) and private parties (3%). Night- and dance clubs account for 1.9% of contracted cases; bars and restaurants for 1.6%. The statistics are based on 729 reports filed by physicians between July 16 and July 30. The health authorities pointed out that carriers at clubs “can lead to a high number of infected people as well as an even higher number of people who have to go into quarantine”. It stated that super-spreader events are a particular burden on the cantonal contact tracing systems, and that it is important to keep the risk of transmission as low as possible, especially in such environments. Some politicians have criticized the federal health authorities for correcting the figures. Lukas Engelberger, president of the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Health Directors, told SRF on Monday that “mistakes can happen”. Engelberger said he assumes that when making decisions, the cantons “react above all to incidents that have occurred locally and which they can assess reliably”. For example, on July 31, canton Geneva already ordered the closure of all nightclubs and cabarets until August 23. Nationwide, public and private events of up to 1,000 people are permitted on condition that contact tracing is guaranteed. Larger events are still banned. "
2020-08-02;Coronavirus vaccine study reportedly stalled for lack of cash;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-vaccine-study-reportedly-stalled-for-lack-of-cash/45942552;Six Swiss hospitals are ready for a first big Covid-19 vaccine study but it can’t start for lack of money, writes a Sunday newspaper. There is a shortfall of CHF8 million, according to the NZZ am Sonntag. An application for partial funding of the project was submitted to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) four weeks ago, but the request has so far gone unanswered, it says. There are no plans at present to finance studies on a Covid-19 vaccine, the FOPH told the paper. NZZ am Sonntag says Switzerland’s federal government is also behind in other areas related to the vaccine. While several countries, including the EU and US, have already reserved large quantities of the future vaccines for their populations, Switzerland has not yet concluded any contracts with companies developing them, it writes. Meanwhile Martin Ackermann, new head of the federal government’s Covid-19 working group, warns in the SonntagsZeitung that Switzerland is on the verge of an exponential increase in the number of new coronavirus infections. He tells the Sunday paper there is little room to relax current restrictive measures to fight the virus and they should even be stepped up. In my opinion, the size of public events permitted should now be reduced to 100 participants, says Ackermann, a microbiology expert at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ). Since June 22, public and private events of up to 1,000 people have been permitted in Switzerland on condition that contact tracing is guaranteed. Larger events are still banned. The recommended safe distance between people was reduced from two metres to 1.5 metres. Some cantons, including Basel and Ticino, have introduced stricter restrictions on gatherings than in the rest of the country. 
2020-08-02;Cantons protest as Belgium puts them on coronavirus risk list;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cantons-protest-as-belgium-puts-them-on-coronavirus-risk-list/45942434;The Western Swiss cantons of Valais and Vaud are protesting a decision by Belgium to put them on a list of European regions where tourists can no longer go because of a resurgence of coronavirus.  Belgium decided on Saturday to add them and canton Geneva to this list. People returning to Belgium from the three Swiss cantons around Lake Geneva must be tested for the virus and go into quarantine. Vaud’s cantonal economics minister Philippe Leuba said on Sunday that the Belgian decision was “incomprehensible” and that Vaud was asking the federal government to intervene with Belgium. Over the last 14 days the rate of infection is 23 per 100,000 inhabitants in Vaud and 10 in Valais, whereas in Belgium it is 44, so Vaud’s rate is almost half Belgium’s, according to Leuba. Switzerland’s criteria for a risk zone is an infection rate of 60 per 100,000 inhabitants. Leuba added that Belgium’s decision was bad for tourism and for the image of his region. Vaud health minister Rebecca Ruiz told Swiss television RTS they were asking to know the criteria on which the decision was based. Valais economics minister Christophe Darbellay said the Belgian decision was “incomprehensible” and “shocking”, and his canton is also asking for federal government intervention. “Canton Valais is controlling Covid-19 well. The situation in Geneva is much more alarming.” Geneva on Friday ordered nightclubs to close until August 23, following a new spike in cases, and cantonal health minister Mauro Poggia told Sunday newspaper Le Matin Dimanche that further measures were possible if the number of cases continues to rise. Canton Geneva now accounts for about one third of new cases in Switzerland. 
2020-08-02;Government mask policy dictated by stocks, say papers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-mask-policy-dictated-by-stocks--say-papers/45942196;Lack of protective masks at the height of the coronavirus crisis dictated the government’s recommendations on wearing masks, say Le Matin Dimanche and SonntagsZeitung newspapers. As they point out, the Swiss government’s recommendations on mask wearing have hardly been consistent.  First it discouraged the general public from wearing them. Now, however, it has made them compulsory on public transport and is encouraging cantons to impose them in shops and closed public spaces. How can this be explained? “Minutes that we have obtained from government crisis bodies show it was the crying lack of masks that dictated the authorities’ communication strategy just as cases were exploding,” writes Le Matin Dimanche. In March, the authorities said masks were “very ineffective”, but the country only had two and a half weeks of stocks at that time, according to the papers. A Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) appeal to the government resulted in one million masks being found and distributed to the cantons. But this was still too few, because it was estimated the whole country would need up to two million a day. The government line only changed at the end of April when 90 million masks ordered by the army pharmacy arrived in Switzerland, says the report. A week later, the FOPH advised the population to wear masks if social distancing was not possible. But there was a problem at first because many people were not following this advice. Vice Chancellor André Simonazzi told a government crisis meeting on June 11 that this was “probably also because we told them for a long time it wasn’t very useful”, writes Le Matin Dimanche. However, former FOPH head of communicable diseases Daniel Koch says it is not because there was a lack of masks that the authorities advised against them. He told the papers it was first necessary that people learn the importance of handwashing and social distancing. “If we had recommended wearing masks at the beginning, people would have been content with that and that would not have resolved the problem,” he is quoted as saying.  
2020-08-01;President honours coronavirus 'heroes' on Swiss National Day;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/president-honours-coronavirus--heroes--on-swiss-national-day/45941502;Fifty-four coronavirus “heroes” were among those invited to a reduced National Day ceremony on the Rütli meadow on Saturday and were hailed by President Simonetta Sommaruga. Each of them had helped to overcome this crisis, she said, for example in hospitals, shops, schools or neighbourhoods. Sommaruga invited a man and a woman from each canton who played a key role in the crisis, as well as from the community of Swiss Abroad. These 54 were among some 150 people who gathered for Sommaruga’s address at midday on the Rütli meadow in central Switzerland where the country’s founding pact was signed. This compares with 2,200 at the same event last year, but the number was cut to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, also thanked the Swiss population for their solidarity during the coronavirus crisis. But she warned that it was not yet over. “New infections are on the rise again and we must remain vigilant,” she said. “Each one of us must be responsible, because it is only together that we will stop the pandemic taking off again,” she said. With gatherings of more than 1,000 people banned, large public fireworks displays have been cancelled, also prompting the Swiss to find other ways of celebrating.  For example in the western town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, known for its watchmaking, more than two thousand people hung the Swiss flag from their windows and balconies as musicians played in the streets. Despite coronavirus restrictions, some 150 farming families opened their doors to the public for a traditional August 1 “Brunch on the Farm”. People came from different parts of the country for a “convivial meal”, according to the Swiss Farmers’ UnionExternal link, including economics minister Guy Parmelin who tasted traditional fare on a farm in canton Graubunden. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump sent congratulations to “the people of the Swiss Confederation” as they celebrate National Day. In a messageExternal link posted on the website of the US embassy in Switzerland, he stressed the US’s “strong bond of friendship with Switzerland”. “This year commemorates the 40th anniversary of Switzerland’s Protecting Power arrangement for the United States in Iran, which has been of great value,” he wrote. “Your government remains instrumental in securing the release of American hostages wrongfully detained by the Iranian regime.  We also greatly appreciate Switzerland’s recent assistance in repatriating United States citizens as the coronavirus disrupted travel around the world.”

The mountain chains of Veisivi and Dent de Perroc, which rise to nearly 4,000 metres in the southern canton of Valais, glowed as magnesium powder was ignited in the event. Thousands gathered below to watch the three-minute long display, at a safe distance from each other. Lots of people around Switzerland normally have fireworks to celebrate our national day, but they weren't able to this year because of distancing regulations, organiser Jacques Morard told Reuters. National Day marks the legendary founding of Switzerland in 1291. Gatherings of more than 1,000 people remain banned to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Traditional large public firework displays for August 1 have been cancelled but some smaller events are planned and politicians will be delivering speeches around the country.

Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga has also sent a message to the Swiss Abroad. 
2020-07-31;The steep, wild valley of hanging meadows;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-steep--wild-valley-of-hanging-meadows/45936518;"Bavona Valley, one of the steepest and remotest valleys in the Swiss Alps, has been chosen as the theme for the 2020 “Chocolate Dollar“. Its biodiversity, its gardens cultivated on the great masses of rock strewn down the valley and the rural landscape left by tenacious farmers of long ago are this year the symbol of a heritage to be preserved – especially at a time of returning to nature . The “Chocolate Dollar”, a chocolate in the shape of a gold coin, is an initiative of the Swiss Heritage SocietyExternal link and the Pro NaturaExternal link organisation. Since 1946 over 40 million of these have been sold, the proceeds going to conservation of natural habitats, landscapes and historic buildings, animal and plant species. Every year they are sold at a price of CHF5 each by 30,000 schoolchildren. Bavona Valley, which was added to Switzerland's list of natural sites and monuments of national importance in 1983, is inhabited only in the summer. Imposing rocks loom over a narrow valley floor of glacial origin, which makes up just a tenth of the territory, and cultivated land makes up no more than 1.5%. The area has major hydroelectric stations, but most of the local houses are not even on the grid. Chosen as a symbol of the human and natural heritage which the two organisations work to preserve, Bavona Valley will receive some tens of thousands of francs from the proceeds of the “Chocolate Dollar“ to be spent in particular on recovering 'hanging meadows'. The valley was inhabited year-round up till 1500 , explains Rachele Gadea Martini, coordinator of the Bavona Valley Foundation. Following alluvial deposits and landslides that dropped an incredible amount of rock down onto the valley floor, taking land away from agriculture, the locals no longer felt safe there and start to move away from the valley. Only for the winter, though, for a month or two; they would come back for summer pasturing., she says. In fact, to win back land where they could grow rye, millet, potatoes, onions and hemp (for its fibre), the inhabitants made terraces on the slopes and reclaimed fields among the rocks and even above them. In the valley there are about 200 of these, of different sizes, naturally. They range from tiny bits of land of a square metre or less, to wide expanses of rock. This is not the only valley where these are found, but it seems to be the only one with such a high density in the whole Alpine region. Does recovering these bits of land mean actually cultivating them? Cultivation makes sense if there are people around who can look after the field or the garden patch. These days, recovery mainly means clearing them of woodland which is advancing (it is eating up not just the hanging meadows) and cutting back the ruderal vegetation like thickets and berry-bushes. The second stage is to shore up the walls and flights of steps if there are any there, says Gadea Martini. The steps leading up to the meadows need to be climbed with care. But the ones leading up to the Alpine pastures are dizzying. They really are quite impressive. Here they herded their grazing animals up flights of steps carved out of the rock, because on both sides of the valley floor we have just sheer vertical walls that go up for 800 metres, and to get up there you need more than just a mountain track. But the hardy 'terrieri' of long ago – the inhabitants took their name from the word 'terre', which is used still today to refer to the 12 hamlets of Bavona Valley – made the challenge into an opportunity. They used the clumps of overhanging rock to dig cellars and build dairy huts or anything else that they found useful – a store, a space for their animals, or a weaving shed or a forge for a blacksmith, she explains. The fields of crops were cultivated up till the early 20th century. Today there are still a few garden patches. The last watershed in the Valley’s history came in 1955: with the opening of a road and hydro stations, many houses in the valley ceased to be permanent homes, and the locals moved to the former communes of Cavergno and Bignasco. A part of this latter was the area of San Carlo, where there was accommodation, a shop and restaurant for the workers, which was hooked up to the grid. The 11 “terre” in Cavergno decided to do without an electricity supply. Bavona Valley was chosen to be featured for the “Chocolate Dollar“ also because of its contribution to biodiversity in Switzerland. Some 2,500 species are listed for the valley but that is only a partial inventory, explains Mirko Zanini, a biologist at the Vallemaggia Nature Centre. Which ones stand out? From a conservation point of view, I am thinking in particular of one flowering plant, Saponaria lutea, which is found in very few places in a quite restricted region of the Alps. In Bavona Valley it is well represented, he says. Also typical of the Alpine environment are the black grouse, the ptarmigan, and the hazel grouse, which live in the higher woodland and are valuable species, needing support because they will be under pressure of climate change in the decades to come. On the valley floor, typical of environments near water, the kingfisher is found, also the sandpiper and the dipper. These are all very vulnerable bird species that can live only where the natural balance is maintained,  says Zanini. This is in fact the secret of Bavona Valley: here the natural environments live together harmoniously with the man-made elements . This has not just meant limiting the built environment. There is no extreme agricultural land reclamation. The waterways are not canalised. Hydroelectric activity has left the natural environments associated with the river untouched, so that the flood-plain of the Bavona river is still of national importance, he continues. Comprehensive management of the territory makes conservation of the dry rough pastures, now rare in Switzerland, feasible. These environments are extremely rich from the point of view of diversity of flowering plants. Characterised by humus poor in nutrients, they manifest a variety of species which tolerate this kind of soil. Fertilising, on the other hand, would favour only four or five species at the expense of all the rest, he says. While there are so many flowering plants,  Zanini adds, we have great animal biodiversity too: spiders, grasshoppers, butterflies. In the Valley, his Centre has counted about a hundred different kinds of butterfly. The Foundation supports the approach of mowing only once or twice a year in Bavona, so as to let the life cycle of insects and flowering plants unfold, which means that seeds can grow and butterflies grow to adulthood. Here too, the woodland has to be kept in check. But why not just let nature take its course? There are natural environments where, if we don’t actively intervene, they just revert to woodland and we lose out on the diversity of habitats as they are now – we lose the animal and plant species that depend on these open environments, says Zanini. But if we can maintain a balance between naturally growing woodland [providing a niche for species that can’t live in “managed” forest] and extensive cultivated surfaces, we end up with a mosaic of habitats and greater biodiversity. Accordingly, the Bavona Valley Foundation promotes activities and visits to the valley combining learning, free time and volunteering ( working holidays ). The restoration of the Begnudini House will provide accommodation for groups beginning in 2021. Every year we get groups of volunteers of different age-groups , says Gadea Martini, from young apprentices to parish seniors’ groups from central Switzerland, to volunteers for work-camps. They all help us to manage the territory, and at the same time we give them an experience of a unique landscape, in touch with ancient rural practices. Apart from reaping the meadows and cleaning up the woodland, the volunteers look after the maintenance of tracks and trails. As regards tourism, the Foundation hopes that the “Chocolate Dollar“ will bring a greater number of visitors to the valley, but that these will be people who have a certain sensitivity and like to get around on foot. People who appreciate the value of this kind of traditional rural landscape and all it takes to maintain it. She worries about the kind of car-based drive-through tourism which leaves traces, and of course waste. Since last year, the Foundation has engaged volunteers who go around the valley chatting with these visitors and making them aware of the fragility of the environment, which is the result of the work of centuries in harmony with nature. In June 2021, Bavona Valley will be featured in “Three Days of Biodiversity”, an event in collaboration with Vallemaggia Nature Centre which was originally scheduled for this year but postponed due to the coronavirus situation. The schedule for all the events can be found hereExternal link. For more information about Bavona Valley see the Swiss tourism siteExternal link. (Translated from Italian by Terence MacNamee)"
2020-07-31;Climber finds Jungfrau 'Corona Pass' deal infectious;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_climber-finds-jungfrau--corona-pass--deal-infectious/45938900;"I've just climbed the Mönch, a 4000m (13,000ft) peak in the Swiss Alps, with two close friends. They are now one step closer to realising their dream of reaching the summits of the famous Bernese Oberland trio: Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau, and we are descending happily, under blue skies, back towards the plateau at the top of the Jungfraufirn: a tributary of the Great Aletsch glacier. It should be a wilderness up here, but this alpine landscape has not been a wilderness since 1912, when the highest mountain railway project in the Alps was completed. It shouldn't come as much surprise then, that the glacier is a hive of activity. Yet still, as the three of us glance down from time to time, there is disbelief. A black, unbroken line, like a row of ants, now stretches out across the glacier from the Jungfraujoch to the Mönchsjoch hut. The people are walking along a groomed track, made by the same machines that usually service ski slopes in winter. The crevasses have all been filled in and a level, engineered footpath has been made – an “official safe zone”. Assuming people stick to it. In the morning we found that not all people do. Deep footsteps from the afternoon before had not yet been ploughed over and instead had frozen solid overnight: This made the track hard going, but to set a good example, and being in no rush, I stuck to it. Then tourists began to overtake, walking five or 10 metres out across the bare glacier surface. From my experience I knew the risks were relatively low; the snow lay thick over the glacier at present; snow bridges are strongest at this time of day. But the only thought in these people's minds was it was easier to walk on. In their trainers. Indeed – that was one person's answer to my friendly warning. Despite having no knowledge of glacier rescue techniques; no ice axe, ropes or other tools to perform them, these people seemed to know best. This is still a glacier wilderness, beneath the thin veneer of man's control. These first faint tracks outside the path encourage the next group of tourists, and the next. Until now, as we look down just after midday, to see some still walking outside the path – above crevasses large enough to lose your house in; presumably to dodge the mass of people going the opposite way. But why are there so many people? The answer lies with the railway company. In the absence of foreign tourists due to Covid-19, they decided to make a deal for Swiss residents – and they named it the “Corona Pass”. I myself laughed, then promptly went out and bought one. As a local alpinist it was rare opportunity. A normal season ticket here has never included the journey to the Jungfraujoch station billed as “Top of Europe” (and probably never will again). For this you had to pay extra. It seems many others, some who don't normally get to travel so high in the mountains, also jumped at the offer – and I can't say I blame them. In the absence of vast numbers of overseas tourists, mostly from Asia and the Gulf States, it seemed the prime opportunity to visit in relative peace (there’s an element of prejudice here, I admit). Unfortunately like any great gold rush, the more people involved, the less value there ends up being. And the dream trip, for many, turns out to be quite a stressful affair. Add into the mix the rules now in place to slow the transmission of Covid-19 and you get some interesting extremes of behaviour. On all public transport in Switzerland the wearing of masks is now mandatory, but not in other indoor spaces. On the first train up in the morning I slid mine off to eat a banana, much to the displeasure of a woman beside me. But once the train arrived at the top, half of the passengers tore theirs off only to enter a series of confined, worm-like tunnels. The train was crowded, and so too was the march through the tunnels, now sans masks for many, as a herd mentality set in - a good idea as going against the crowd was all but impossible. Some people, aware of the infection risk, tried to keep a space around them, but others were nonchalant about body contact.  The reward at the end of the tunnel is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many to stand on a glacier, surrounded by icy peaks so close you think you can reach out and touch them. In a normal year, most tourists are content to stay close to the tunnel, soak up the views and throw snowballs. But the majority of visitors this summer are locals, and no self-respecting Swiss would pass up the opportunity to hike, especially if it’s a chance to walk across a glacier, with a prize at the end; lunch at the hut just below the peak we had just climbed. They had formed the never-ending row of ants we were watching from above and were now about to re-join since our lodging for the night was the very hut they were headed for. We arrived to find people crammed into each available space; laughing and coughing, mask free, their rucksacks on the floor ready to trip you up. With all thoughts of coronavirus having been forgotten the inside of the hut was more hazardous than climbing a mountain or crossing a glacier.  When the midday rush was nearly over, the strain was still clearly visible on the faces of the staff. Yet a young server still managed a polite “No” when asked whether they had “pizza or fries”, as if this were a fast food restaurant, not a high-altitude lodging where have to melt snow to make water. In the early evening with the crowds finally gone, the hut was again the cosy and calm place I have always known. A mountain hut like any other.  The next day we summited the Jungfrau. My two friends realised their dream. Our climbing complete, we headed back through the tunnel to catch the train only to fight against the current of new Corona Pass holders. Jostling. Masks on, masks off. "
2020-07-30;Swiss underscore hygiene rules amid rising infections;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-underscore-hygiene-rules-amid-rising-infections/45936952;As daily infections climbed above 200, the health office launched a new campaign to remind of the ever-present Covid-19 threat. Director Pascal Strupler also said a mask requirement in shops and public spaces is recommended. On Thursday, the Federal Office of Public Health launched a campaign reiterating the basic anti-Covid-19 hygiene rules with the main message: “the virus is still here”. Since the easing of measures to protect the population from the novel coronavirus, individual responsibility has become more important, said the office. With the new postersExternal link, the authorities warn not to let one’s guard down. The slogan is The virus is also at work during the holiday season. Keep your distance! Pascal Strupler, the head of the health office, reiterated the hygiene guidelines including hand washing and wearing a mask when one can’t maintain the 1.5 metres distance. Strupler also recommended a mask requirement in shops and public spaces. Mask wearing is mandatory on all public transportation in Switzerland, while some regions have also required they be worn in shops. Daily new infections surpassed the 200 mark for the first time in Switzerland since the lockdown was eased. A total of 220 new cases were recorded, as well as one new death, bringing the total to 1,704 deaths. There have been 35,022 confirmed cases in Switzerland. Patrick Mathys, who head the crisis management and international cooperation unit at the health office, said that “the numbers are creeping up and are likely to increase further. The positive infection rate is also increasing steadily.” He added that 10% of infections are the result of travel abroad with some 6% of which due to travel in high risk countries. Some 9,000 people are currently in quarantine after returning from risk countries. The government announced that people from third countries (non-EU) can enter Switzerland if they are in a relationship with a Swiss starting on August 3. Up to now, this has only been allowed if a couple is married or has a child together. There were some exceptions for emergencies. As other countries introduce coronavirus testing for travelers, Mathys said that for the moment the office does not plan to test people entering the country. He explained that there is still no evidence that this can reduce the number of infections. Depending on when the person is infected, it may give a false negative result. Anyone entering Switzerland from any of the 42  high risk countriesExternal link, including the United States, has to undergo a ten-day quarantine. Anyone who evades quarantine or fails to report to the authorities could be fined up to CHF10,000 ($10,900). Countries are on the “high risk” list if new infections in the last 14 days has been higher than 60 per 100,000 inhabitants.
2020-07-30;Covid-19 solidarity stamp a ‘huge success’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-solidarity-stamp-a--huge-success-/45936612;A special stamp introduced in April to help those affected by Covid-19 has raised some CHF2.5 million ($2.73 million), Swiss Post said on Thursday. Around 500,000 of the new stamps have travelled on envelopes and parcels across the country in the past months, with the proceeds divided equally between Swiss Solidarity and the Swiss Red Cross. These organisations have used the money notably for projects that deliver aid materials and food to risk groups and to people who have fallen into need during the pandemic. The stamp itself, worth CHF5, features the Swiss cross on a flamboyant red background – a symbol of the “solidarity and steadfast social cohesion” during the pandemic, Swiss Post said. The campaign is ongoing, and booklets for CHF50 containing 10 stamps apiece are available online or in large post offices. Swiss Solidarity, meanwhile, reported in July that it had raised some CHF40 million since March which it has distributed to various groups working to help those affected by Covid-19. Contributions to the organisation’s special pandemic fund can still be made via the website (www.glueckskette.chExternal link) or the postal account 10-15000-6, using the reference “Coronavirus”.
2020-07-30;Swiss banks exceed expectations in weathering coronavirus crisis ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/credit-suisse-exceeded-expectation/45936174;The two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, posted strong financial results for the first half of the year despite uncertainty surrounding the pandemic’s impact on the global economy On Thursday, Credit Suisse reported its best second quarter results in a decade. From April to June 2020, net income at the second-largest Swiss bank rose year-on-year to almost CHF1.2 billion ($1.3 billion), 24% more than in the previous year. “In a continued volatile market environment, we delivered a strong performance,” said Thomas Gottstein, who became chief executive of the Swiss bank in February following the resignation of Tidjane Thiam, who became embroiled in a spying scandal. The bank benefited from the Swiss market's resilience thanks in part to a Swiss government-backed scheme to provide cash-strapped small and medium-sized companies with emergency loans to get through the coronavirus crisis. Companies had to apply for the credit via their banks. On May 23, Credit Suisse reported that it had issued 15,400 pandemic emergency loans totaling CHF2.8 billion. In March, when the pandemic triggered a major recession,  various experts outlined dire scenarios including huge credit losses, cash shortages, and even a collapse of many banks. In contrast to the financial crisis in 2008 when the banks experienced major losses, the results from both UBS and Credit Suisse in the second quarter, are reassuring. UBS and Credit Suisse reported net profit of CHF2.6 billion and CHF2.5 billion respectively. The long-term sustainability of the company’s business model remains unclear. Due to market volatility, the bank said that it was difficult to assess the full economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. The bank also announced some reorganisation, merging the various investment banking units that had been put in place by Thiam into a single “global investment bank”. The company has also created a new executive role responsible for sustainability. It is also planning cost savings of around CHF400 million from 2022. In an interview on Bloomberg television on Thursday, Gottstein said job cuts would be “very limited”. Earlier this year, Gottstein indicated that Credit Suisse would come out of the coronavirus crisis needing fewer employees in the medium term as it faced the prospect of lower growth and looming credit defaults. The bank announced that it plans to pay out the second part of the dividend for the 2019 financial year as planned. Earlier this year the Swiss financial market regulator Finma had called on the big banks to exercise restraint over the distribution of dividends in light of the pandemic. This drew criticism from several banks, and an agreement was eventually reached with Finma whereby the banks would split dividend payments, with one in the spring and one in the fall. Nestlé and LafargeHolcim are among other Swiss companies reporting second quarter results this week. Nestlé cut its annual sales growth forecast to 2-3% on Thursday, saying that they were responding to a drop in demand as people moved away from stockpiling food, which had benefited packaged food companies. The company results still exceeded expectations. Net profit grew by 18.3% to CHF5.9 billion in the first half, ahead of a forecast for CHF5.07 billion. LafargeHolcim saw a recovery in construction markets in June after the pandemic hit sales and profit in the first half of the year. The CEO said that they had likely hit the worst of the crisis when construction projects were put on hold earlier this year. In all five of its regions returning to 2019 levels by the end of June as lockdowns eased.

2020-07-29;Media coronavirus coverage relatively good, says study ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/media-coronavirus-coverage-relatively-good--says-study-/45934198;Swiss media have covered the coronavirus pandemic relatively well, but many media were  insufficiently critical in the pre-lockdown phase, says a new study by the University of Zurich.  On some days, up to 70% of media content concerned coronavirus, says the report by the university’s Research Centre for the Public Sphere and Society (Fög Institute). This compares with “barely 10%” on the climate debate in election year 2019, even though climate was a top theme of the polls. Rarely does a topic receive such intense coverage, say the authors.  This report looks at media coverage across Switzerland in the first half of 2020.  Media as a whole maintain a critical distance from government and authorities , the authors found. However, in the pre-lockdown  phase when drastic measures were decided, many media were “not critical enough”.  The study notes that media coverage of the pandemic covered a wide range of topics, including medicine, politics and economics. Media often called in experts, especially virologists, epidemiologists and immunologists.  Disciplines such as sociology, psychology and political science were strongly under-represented, says Fög Institute director Mark Eisenegger. This was also the case for women: out of the 30 most frequently interviewed experts, only two were women.

A panel of experts recommends extending the list of risk countries to include those that do little or no testing, according to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper. The experts call for new criteria to be included for the risk list, based on viral spreading trends, epidemiologist Marcel Tanner of the Covid-19 task force is quoted as saying. However, the Federal Health Office uses the number of new infections as the main benchmark - any country with more than 60 new cases per 100,000 residents for a period of 14 days. Other criteria are the number of infected people from a country. Under Swiss regulations, anyone travelling back to Switzerland from a risk country has to stay in quarantine for ten days - even if a recent test found no traces of a Covid-19 infection - and is subject to fines of up to CHF10,000 ($10,880) if they are found ignoring the rules. Last week, the health authorities expanded the list of risk countries to 42 from 29 and a further update is expected over the next few days. Tanner said quarantine remained the most efficient way to stop the spread of the virus, but cantonal authorities have repeatedly complained that they don't receive reliable data from the health office about people arriving in the country by air or overland. However, the costs of setting up medical checkpoints at airports to measure the body temperature of passengers are too high, according to Tanner.

The authorities have been unable to verify the man’s identity; he is either from Morocco or Algeria. The State Secretariat for Migration had rejected his application for asylum. After serving a 34-month prison sentence for robbery, theft and other offences, the man was taken into custody for deportation in October 2019. In addition to the prison sentence, the Zurich District Court also issued a nine-year expulsion order. As Swiss authorities investigated the man’s origins, his deportation detention was extended. Then came the extraordinary situation caused by Covid-19. In a ruling published on Tuesday, the Federal Court ordered that the man be released since he can’t be deported in the foreseeable future. It noted that the man had already been in deportation custody for seven months when the Zurich court had decided to extend custody in late March – without knowing when there would be the opportunity to fly the man out. According to migration law, detention pending deportation may last up to six months. If a detainee does not cooperate, it may be extended by a maximum of 12 more months. The Federal Court ruling states that even if the man’s inability to prove his identity is awkward, he isn’t responsible for pandemic-related travel difficulties or the delay in waiting for foreign authorities to confirm his identity.

But this week, in honour of the Swiss National Day on August 1, President Simonetta Sommaruga has pushed the metaphoric boat out to new lengths. In an address to Swiss citizens around the world, she makes the bold claim that democracy is a lot like a holiday campsite. Not just any campsite mind you: Sommaruga comes to us from Bern’s beloved “Eichholz” – a site by the Aare river where thousands of locals (and non-locals, if they behave) gather in summer to grill sausages, jump in the flowing water, and have a generally good time. The president explains: people in Eichholz experience in miniature what democratic societies experience every day, she says. People of all shapes and backgrounds come and rub shoulders and enjoy the relaxed setting. “It can even happen that an unexpected frisbee lands on your towel!” she chuckles. If only things were so idyllic… Because it’s not all fun and games: such a place (the campsite, that is) is ripe for strife, Sommaruga warns. Overcrowded, overheated, and over-inebriated, it’s inevitable that misunderstandings pop up – about the best patch of grass or that stray frisbee, say. And yet, she says: “Those who gather on the grass of Eichholz get along rather well.” Why? “Because they know that not everyone shares the same interests, and that it’s important to talk with one another when there’s a problem”. And though “not all of you live in places with democratic structures,” she goes on gravely, “in each of your countries, you represent Switzerland and its democratic values, and each of your interactions is a reminder that peaceful coexistence is possible.” Thank you for being such good ambassadors of Switzerland, the president finishes, as the sunbathers behind her look on blithely. A little imagery can go a long way… Elsewhere in Swiss democracy, the more serious issue of the deportation of foreign criminals has come up again. In 2010, voters approved a controversial initiative demanding that non-Swiss be automatically deported if convicted of committing certain serious crimes. If you’re not an official citizen camper, the law says, you’d better abide by the rules: otherwise, you and your deckchair are out. Ten years on, new stats show that the law – and particularly a “hardship clause” invoked to avoid sending people back to difficult or inhumane situations – is applied differently around the campsite, with various regions showing more leniency than others. On average, just 42% of such troublemakers are kicked out. The People’s Party, a large and loud group sitting in the middle of the grass on a Swiss-cross-emblazoned towel, is not happy about it. This amounts to “a destruction of the rule of law”, politician Adrian Amstutz said last week. “Our rules clearly say there is no room in Switzerland for rejected asylum seekers, criminals, or welfare-scamming foreigners. But courts are making a mockery of this.” The Richard Gere-esque Amstutz, one of the rightwing party’s chief holidaymakers, appeared before the press with his sun-screened colleague Thomas Aeschi, threatening that if the situation didn’t change, they would launch another initiative to demand the rules are kept. It’s not the first time the party is disgruntled about decisions not being properly implemented; the 2014 anti-mass immigration initiative – another controversial idea that was narrowly accepted, but only lightly implemented – will be back before voters again this September. But it’s a tricky balance to find, the harried campground supervisors say: we make our rules, but we also have to abide by the overarching regulations of the international campground federation. No campground is an island… Another disgruntled group are the opponents of the recently-released SwissCovid app – the coronavirus contact tracing software so far downloaded by around a million people. Angry about this blatant attempt to keep tabs on how many sausages they have grilled and where they have grilled them, the anti-SwissCovid group said last week it would start collecting signatures to force a vote on the legislation underpinning the app. Fearing a Chinese style “digital dictatorship”, the committee is not satisfied with the data protection guarantees given by the government-backed software. They also reckon “false positive” notifications could lead to pointless quarantines or extra social hysteria. Will they succeed in revoking the law? This could be a moot point: the app has been in circulation for over a month now, and judging by the speed at which issues make their way to camp-wide votes in Switzerland, it’s unlikely this will come before citizens before the end of the pandemic. But they have made a splash, which in the democratic scheme of things is a success in itself. They have three months to collect the 50,000 signatures to force a referendum. Finally, if you can stomach a final round of metaphors, we would like to draw your attention to another newly published ‘Focus’ page on the swissinfo.ch site. “Fifty shades of democracy” looks at the increasingly common practice of measuring, comparing and ranking democracies around the world in order to say which one is best. Written by our global correspondent Bruno Kaufmann, the Focus not only dives into the question of which is the world’s best campsite, but also the question of who is doing the judging, and what they are judging: is it the quality of grass? The fair application of swimming pool rules? The participation both of backstrokers and frontcrawlers in making these rules in the first place? Is it even possible to say which is best, or is it all in the eye of the beholder? Thanks for reading, and let us know if there’s any other democracy topics you’d like us to report on. Get in touch with our correspondents Domhnall O’SullivanExternal link or Bruno KaufmannExternal link."
2020-07-28;Covid measures keep tropical diseases at bay;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-measures-keep-tropical-diseases-at-bay/45931982;Switzerland’s coronavirus-related travel restrictions have had at least one positive effect: this year the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has received half as many reports of tropical diseases as last year. The FOPH noted lower figures for “travel-related diseases” such as dengue fever, chikungunya fever and malaria, spokesman Jonas Montani said on Tuesday. The decline is likely to be due “mainly” to the travel restrictions imposed in an attempt to curb the spread of Covid-19. The FOPH had expected this outcome, since the pathogens are acquired primarily on journeys to the tropics or subtropics. There has never been a recorded transmission of dengue fever or chikungunya virus in Switzerland. Two cases of malaria infection have been recorded in Switzerland, both in the Zurich area: one in 1997 and one in 1999. The FOPH suspects this was due to mosquitoes that had arrived on a plane. This so-called airport malaria would also be affected by travel restrictions, Montani said. He added that it could not be ruled out that people had decided not to go to the doctor after a trip, meaning the FOPH would not be aware of an infection. According to FOPH figures published in its latest BulletinExternal link, the number of cases of the three diseases reported so far in the year under review was about half as high as in the same period last year. There have been 82 reported cases of malaria (down from 140), 60 cases of dengue fever (118) and ten cases of Chikungunya fever (23).
2020-07-28;Hyperloop projects inch closer to reality;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hyperloop-projects-inch-closer-to-reality/45925150;It’s 2030. You’re sitting in a sleek 25-passenger pod-like capsule levitated on a track inside a sealed low-pressure tube, speeding across the country to your destination at 600 miles (966 kilometres) an hour or faster. You’re aboard hyperloop. This is an ultra-fast pod transit system that, as of 2020, has seemed like a pipe dream for years. But new investments, regulations and entrepreneurs, including a Swiss start-up, could help make the futuristic transport system a reality. Recently popularised by Tesla founder Elon Musk, the futuristic transit concept appears to be drawing increased interest in the United States, Europe, China, India and the Middle East. Richard Branson’s Virgin Hyperloop, which has raised over $400 million (CHF370 million), is among the leading firms racing to launch such high-speed pods and infrastructure. Others include HyperloopTT in the US, Canada’s Transpod, Spain’s Zeleros and the Netherlands’ Haardt. Virgin Hyperloop wants to launch commercial routes by 2029. It originally planned to begin construction this year on the world’s first Hyperloop in India, linking Mumbai to Pune, but the pandemic has delayed the process. The concept of ultra-fast magnetic levitation trains is nothing new to Switzerland. Swissmetro, a proposal for a network of “vactrains” speeding through tunnels beneath the Alpine country, was conceived by Swiss engineer Rodolphe Nieth in 1979. The project gathered pace in the 1990s but was abandoned in 2009 due to a lack of support from the Swiss authorities amid competition from the Gotthard Tunnel project. Today, the SwissmetroNG association continues to push for a study into high-speed underground transport. Meanwhile, a new generation of Swiss scientists and entrepreneurs is exploring hyperloop. The Valais-based start-up Swisspod is working on a capsule prototype for 25 passengers, which it hopes will be ready for the global market by 2025. “We have a pod design that is able to travel between Geneva and Zurich [approximately 270km] in 17 minutes,” Swisspod CEO Denis Tudor told swissinfo.ch. The capsule and its technologies are under wraps. Parts being produced in China have been delayed by several months due to the coronavirus pandemic, but “everything is now back on track,” assures Tudor. A test phase is planned soon. The spin-off, which was founded in 2019 and now employs 30 staff, recently attracted six-figure seed investment funding from Romanian investors. Canton Valais in southern Switzerland appears keen to become a hyperloop hub. Collombey-Muraz, where Swisspod has an office, was picked in 2018 as the site for a three-kilometre high-speed hyperloop test track and research centre. This will be developed by the Eurotube foundation in partnership with Swiss Federal Railways. They want to begin construction in 2021 and operate the test track for period of eight to ten years. New legislation on its way to the United States Senate that recognises hyperloop transportation. In Europe there is strong interest in hyperloop from 16 European Union member states, with Brussels following and trying to coordinate developments. In June, Swisspod confirmed it had joined other firms in the European Commission’s Hyperloop Development Initiative, which it hopes will speed up the deployment of projects on the continent. The Initiative, a collaboration of start-ups and European space and transportation agencies, aims to draw up a regulatory roadmap and standardisation for this new mode of environmentally-friendly transport. It’s part of the European Union’s wider efforts to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Marcel Jufer, an honorary professor at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and former promoter of Swissmetro, has been advising Swisspod. He is brutally honest about the company’s chances. “A Geneva-Zurich line at 1,200 kilometres per hour is impossible,” he told swissinfo.ch. For a small country like Switzerland the optimum speed would be around 400-450 kilometres per hour. A higher speed makes no sense because of the short distances between Swiss cities, he said. Jufer believes that Tudor's Swisspod project is possible in Switzerland, but only in a tunnel – not in tubes. To achieve that, beyond convincing the authorities, it would be crucial to get big cement and civil engineering firms like ABB on board, he added. “If they don’t have big companies working or investing in their firm, they have no chance of developing a complete pod.” The Swisspod CEO said it would be an “honour” to build a hyperloop system in Switzerland using Swiss-made technology. But he acknowledges that the market is developing faster elsewhere, like China, India, the US and other parts of Asia. “We want to sell capsules worldwide,” Tudor said. Yet the challenges – technological, financial and regulatory – facing developers like Swisspod remain formidable. “The biggest one right now is building a propulsion system which is efficient and can deliver a speed of 1,000-1,200 kilometres per hour,” said the Swisspod CEO. But there are many other technical issues. How do you evacuate passengers from a hyperloop tube? How do you maintain a low pressure in the tube or prevent equipment from overheating when there is no air? And how to build a magnetic levitation system powerful enough to transport up to 25 people? Government funds and support will be crucial to massively ramp small-scale hyperloop prototypes into viable commercial projects, say observers. The industry must also consolidate via international regulations and standards agreed upon by states and operators. And then there are extreme dangers to infrastructure from earthquakes or acts of sabotage. There are clear obstacles, said Carlo Borghini, executive director of Shift2Rail. The public-private EU partnership for rail innovation in Europe helps oversee the Hyperloop Development Initiative. “Beyond the testing and small-scale operations, there are many question marks about when we will have a demonstrator version and clear evidence of capacity,” he said, questioning whether the EU, US and India will be capable of sustaining six to seven different initiatives or whether they will ultimately need to converge. The next two years will be crucial, according to Borghini. “In 24 months these firms need to show real concrete projects with an operational hyperloop or many will face difficulties and it won’t be sustainable for them.”
2020-07-28;Swiss finance 36 Covid-19 projects;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-finance-36-covid-19-projects/45931202;More than 200 projects have been submitted since March 6 as part of the research programme launched by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) on coronavirus and its impact. “We have been able to finance 36 of them,” SNSF president Matthias Egger told Le Temps newspaper on Tuesday. He said all of the selected programmes, which cross many disciplines, had started. “Furthermore, in May we launched a national research programme on Covid-19 on behalf of the government. The projects are very diverse, many of which obviously concern immunology or virology.” Egger is also a professor at the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern and hopes that the research “will soon be translated into concrete applications”. To improve the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, Egger proposes setting up a state-of-the-art infectious disease surveillance system in Switzerland, “integrating clinical and biological information in real time”. He also advocates a “digitised and efficient” system for tracing contacts that is the same in all cantons. As of Monday, there have been more than 34,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and 1,700 deaths. 
2020-07-27;Study highlights life and death impact of Swiss lockdown timing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-lockdown-timing-saved-thousands--claims-study/45929698;Researchers at the University of Bern reckon that Covid-19 would have killed 6,000 more people in Switzerland if the lockdown had come a week later. But a week earlier, it could have saved 1,600. Public life in Switzerland essentially shut down on March 17 after the federal government ordered exceptional measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Prior to that, some cantons like Ticino had already told schools, restaurants and other business to shut their doors. A team at the University of Bern analysed the effect of the timing of the national lockdown – and how that potentially influenced the number of infections and the strain on hospitals. The study concluded that another 500 people would have died had the lockdown measures taken effect just a day later – on March 18. Waiting a whole week would have brought the total number of deaths to 8,000 – which is 6,000 more than the nearly 2,000 who have died of Covid-19. “Early implementation of NPIs [non-pharmaceutical interventions] during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can reduce the number of deaths and the necessary duration of strict control measures considerably,” concluded the study. However, the studyExternal link also revealed that 1,600 people would still be alive today had the lockdown taken effect a week earlier. Since the virus hit Switzerland around 33,500 people have tested positive to the virus and almost 2,000 have died in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.5 million. From its March peak, the number of new cases fell to around a dozen in early June, alongside a drop in hospital cases and deaths. But since the easing of the lockdown from mid-June, the number of new cases has begun to slowly creep up in different parts of the country. Over the past couple of weeks the average number of new cases has been over 100 per day. 
2020-07-27;Iran receives first shipment under Swiss humanitarian trade channel;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/iran-receives-first-shipment-under-swiss-humanitarian-trade-channel/45929264;"A humanitarian aid channel allowing Swiss-based companies to send medicines and other vital goods to Iran despite US sanctions has become operational.    On Monday, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) confirmed to Reuters that the first transaction had been completed. The channel, known as the “Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement” (SHTA), was facilitated by Swiss “good offices” between the US and Iran. It comes amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit Iran particularly hard, and as Switzerland and Tehran mark 100 years of diplomatic ties. Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from US sanctions.    “We would like to emphasise that the operationalisation of the SHTA is progressing and that a number of companies have already been approved, more companies will follow. Further transactions should be carried out shortly,” SECO told Reuters by email.   SECO did not identify the Swiss drugmaker or give a value for the shipment, which it said involved a cancer drug used to treat iron overload caused by repeated blood transfusions.    Trial operations of the channel began in January, during which Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Novartis supplied Iran with €2.3 million (CHF2.4 million) worth of cancer drugs and medicines needed for organ transplants. The channel has not taken off; Swiss officials blame delays on Covid-19.   "
2020-07-27;Coronavirus prompts many Swiss to make living wills;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-prompts-many-swiss-to-make-living-wills/45925442;"The Covid-19 pandemic has led many in Switzerland to consider their end-of-life arrangements. The number of requests for “living wills” – directives for medical intervention – skyrocketed during the lockdown.  I would not like to end up as a vegetable. I don’t want to have to go through that. I don’t want to feel like I can’t breathe anymore,” Susanne Degives, an 87-year-old from Geneva told the Swiss public broadcaster RTS in June. I believe that people who have reached a certain age should just be let go in peace.”  She reached her conclusion as she saw people she knew suffering from the coronavirus – they underwent intensive therapy and have still not fully recovered. They couldn’t speak, they couldn’t breathe, and two months later, they are still in poor health, she said.  This experience prompted Degives to make her own living will. Many others in Switzerland have been doing the same to ensure that they can decide what happens at the end of their lives.  In German-speaking Switzerland, before the coronavirus crisis, 50% of people over 65 had the paperwork for making a living will but had not completed it. We believe that the number of completed forms has now greatly increased, said Tatjana Kistler, a spokesperson for the advocacy organisation for the elderly Pro Senectute.  A survey commissioned by Pro Senectute in 2017, consisting of 1,200 telephone interviews with people between 18 and 99 years old, found that only 22% of people in Switzerland had made a living will. The largest share (47%) was people between 60 and 70 years old. The proportion of people who had made a living will in the German-speaking part of the country (27%) was over the national average, whereas in the French-speaking (10%) and Italian-speaking parts (5%) it was considerably lower.  But during the lockdown, demand for living will paperwork increased by more than 50% in French and Italian-speaking regions, according to Kistler.   In this period of extreme crisis, the images people saw on television caused fear,” Alain Huber of Pro Senectute, a Switzerland-wide advocacy organisation for the elderly, told RTS. “We heard many comments from elderly people, along the lines of: I have had a good life, now I’m 90, and I don’t want to die like that.”  Living wills are part of the portfolio of personal documents called DOCUPASSExternal link, prepared by Pro Senectute, which allows any person to record all their instructions, requests and wishes in case of serious illness. Besides the living will, the portfolio includes power of attorney, which appoints someone to assume responsibility for the signatory’s everyday affairs, manage their finances and act for them in case of mental incapacity. DOCUPASS also offers materials for making arrangements in case of death (including any wishes regarding organ donation); the last will and testament; and a summary card with the name and address of a person to contact in case of emergency.  In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, Pro Senectute has noticed increased interest in these arrangements, according to Kistler. But even before the pandemic, we noticed that much younger people were expressing interest in the idea of personal arrangements, either because their own parents want to do this, or because they have become more aware that it is advantageous to make personal arrangements as early as possible,” she said.  "
2020-07-27;Swiss care homes and hospitals charged for mouldy masks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/care-homes-and-hospitals-charged-for-mouldy-masks/45929084;Expired, foul-smelling masks cost nearly a franc apiece for facilities in canton Bern at the start of the coronavirus crisis. As a healthcare worker told Swiss public radio, SRF, on Monday, some of the masks they had received earlier this year had to be recalled because they were covered in mildew. However, the care home was still expected to pay the Bernese cantonal health authority CHF0.90 ($0.98) apiece for any masks that they had used – even the free ones supplied by the military. Some of the masks had expired in 2007, the healthcare worker reported, adding that they stank. The masks had come from a stockpile maintained by the Swiss army, which distributed them to the nation’s 26 cantons for free in March in an effort to slow the spread of Covid-19. “Because hospitals and care homes didn’t have enough emergency supplies, the army and the canton stepped in. We had to buy masks at the (then) world market price of over one franc each,” Gundekar Giebel, head of communications at Bern’s cantonal health department, told SRF. The CHF0.90 price reflects the average cost of those masks and the free ones from the army. Giebel justified the cost on account of the amount of public funds spent. “The hospitals and homes could have purchased protective material on the world market themselves,” he noted. Bern-based nursing home association Curaviva told SRF that its homes are well prepared and have experience dealing with communicable diseases – but that the coronavirus pandemic has meant a sharp rise in the need for supplies when worldwide demand is huge.

2020-07-25;Quads born in Bern;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/quads-born-in-bern/45926814;Quadruplets have been delivered in Bern, the first in Switzerland for more than four years. The pregnancy and birth had gone “really well” given the difficult conditions of the coronavirus pandemic, the hospital said. The three boys and one girl – Katharina, Theodor, Amadeus and Samuel – each weighed 1-1.5kg (2.2-3.3lb) at birth, said Daniel Surbek, chief physician of the Insel Hospital’s gynaecological clinic. While their mother will be able to go home in two days, the children will stay until they weigh 2-2.5kg, he said on Friday. The four babies were delivered by Caesarean section at the beginning of the eighth month of pregnancy. More than 20 specialist doctors and nurses looked after the mother during the delivery. The last time quads were born in Switzerland, which sees around 88,000 lives births a year, was more than four years ago, the hospital said. A studyExternal link in 2011 found that the incidence of quadruplet and quintuplet births in Switzerland had fallen over the previous two decades, while that of triplet births had risen by 40%. There have been at least three reported sets of quintuplets in Switzerland and no sextuplets or more. Globally, the highest number of surviving births is eight (octuplets). 
2020-07-25;Will Covid-19 jumpstart the ‘gig economy’ in Switzerland?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/will-covid-19-jumpstart-the--gig-economy--in-switzerland-/45923052;The so-called “gig economy” has taken off around the world, but Switzerland has always been lukewarm to the concept. Will the Alpine country be more open to ad-hoc employment following the coronavirus pandemic? Ride-hailing by smartphone, Airbnb, food delivery and on-demand home cleaning have shown that there’s no need to be hired by a company, since short-term or one-off services can easily be booked online. This new form of flexible employment has grown rapidly in much of Europe, the Americas and Asia.   But Switzerland has so far not gotten on board. The Swiss Federal Statistical Office conducted a survey External linkfor the first time of gig workers who provided services or sold goods through online platforms for money. Not only were there few gig workers providing services in this way, but the income was minimal. In 2019, only 0.4% of Swiss residents said that they had used online platforms in the previous 12 months to engage in product sales, house rental, food delivery, and ride-hailing. In countries such as China, India and the United StatesExternal link, a sizeable segment of the working-age population has made providing goods and services on demand through the internet and mobile apps their main source of income. But most gig workers in Switzerland only make an annual pre-tax income of less than CHF1,000 (1,075) through online platforms. The per capita annual income of Swiss residents who take on gigs through online platforms is CHF 5,849 - just CHF 487 per month. The average monthly salary in Switzerland is CHF6,538 per month. Karin Frick, a researcher focusing on future trends in social and economic development at the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI), a Swiss think tank, is not surprised.“Switzerland is so wealthy and prosperous. As long as there are enough relatively high-paying jobs in the market, it is difficult for companies like Uber to gain a foothold here,” she toldExternal link the news website Watson. The Statistical Office’s survey results bear out her observation. Of all Swiss residents who participated in the gig economy through online platforms, only 1.2% chose to be gig workers because they could not find a stable job. Marko KovicExternal link, president of the Zurich Institute of Public Affairs Research (ZIPAR), believes that it’s not that Swiss people aren’t interested in gigs, but that “compared with the United States and China, [for example], Switzerland is still a toddler in terms of the gig economy.” The number of gig workers remains limited. “With the very few online platforms which have yet to take a strong foothold in the country, it is difficult to make a living in Switzerland by taking on gigs alone,” he said.   Earlier this year, the various restrictions adopted by Switzerland to curb the spread of the coronavirus forced some freelancers who were once active in the gig economy — such drivers for app-based ride services, on-call domestic workers or freelance photographers — to stop working in the face of drastically reduced job opportunities and concerns over the spreading virus. However, the social distancing measures adopted during the pandemic have brought unexpected benefits to certain gig economy sectors. “Since mid-March, Uber Eats has been very active in expanding business in Switzerland. In just a few months, we have added Lucerne, St. Gallen, Neuchatel and Winterthur to our service network on top of the initial 10 cities, and we plan to go on expanding our coverage in the coming months,” said Luisa Elster, head of public relations at Uber Eats Switzerland, an online platform that provides food delivery services. She noted that between January and June, the number of restaurant partners in Zurich alone doubled and the delivery area has expanded five times over. Kovic believes that in the post-pandemic era, “Switzerland will have more online platforms and apps that match supply with demand, and there will be more fertile ground for the gig economy to grow. There is no doubt about that.” The number of blue-collar service industry gig workers is expected to increase. That’s because some people may consider taking on gigs to make money amid the economic fallout from Covid-19 and resulting un-and-underemployment. “I think this trend will continue in Switzerland, and companies [that offer gig jobs] will benefit from it,” Kovic predicts. But Kovic believes that although pandemic restrictions in Switzerland have enabled consumers to “keep a safe social distance”, a closer look reveals that food delivery instead of restaurant dining and ride services instead of public transport are made possible at the expense of the labor rights of gig workers. Elster of Uber Eats emphasises that the company provided all drivers and food delivery staff with necessary protective gear such as masks during the lockdown, and began to offer all independent partners – as she calls the company’s gig workers – compensation to offset loss of income from accidents and diseases in 2018. But Kovic says that’s the crux of the problem lies in addressing the lack of job security faced by gig workers. “Is the gig economy beneficial for all stakeholders? No, the reality in recent years has been that it has many drawbacks,” he said. Like their peers in other countries, Swiss gig workers generally enjoy the benefits of flexible working hours brought by the gig economy but lack job security. Kovic wroteExternal link in an article that gig workers are especially vulnerable when it comes to their identity and role within the framework of labour law. Most gig platforms do not regard gig workers as employees, but as “self-employed individuals” who bear their own risks. Gig workers are often responsible for their own social security and insurance. However, many gig workers don’t contribute to a pension fund and may suffer loss of income in the event of an accident. In some parts of Switzerland, the courts have stepped in to rule in favour of gig workers’ full employment status. A Geneva court ruled in June that Uber Eats is an employer under the law and as such has the obligation to hire its drivers as full employees, with social insurance benefits. “Switzerland needs strategic regulation which must be backed by policies,” Kovic says, citing a similar ruling in CaliforniaExternal link over the employment status of Uber and Lyft drivers as a positive example. “I think Switzerland can draw some inspiration from it.   
2020-07-24;Swiss resort to host drive-in classical concerts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-resort-to-host-drive-in-classical-concerts/45925664;" The Swiss resort of Charmey is to host Switzerland's first ever drive-in classical music festival. The “Drive-in Festival du LiedExternal link” of six concerts will run from Saturday until 31 July and is designed to be “coronavirus compatible”, reports Swiss public television RTSExternal link. The car park of the Charmey ski lifts, in the heart of the Fribourg Pre-Alps, will be transformed, giving people the opportunity to listen to the concerts from their cars. This event is the brainchild of mezzo-soprano Marie-Claude Chappuis, founder of the Festival du Lied de Fribourg. A solution had to be found so that the artists could return to live performances while making sure the audience remain safe,” she told RTS. “The idea for the drive-in came to me when I was thinking about the cinema system. Audiences in cars will hear the concerts by opening the windows or roofs of their vehicles. A large LED screen will guarantee good visibility of the artists on stage. And in the event of rain, an FM channel will be available to festival-goers. A number of socially distanced chairs will also be available for those who don’t wish to sit in a car.

2020-07-24;Thousands quarantined after high-risk trips and contact ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/thousands-quarantined-after-high-risk-trips-and-contact-/45925512;5,565 people have been quarantined after a trip to one of 42 listed risk countries for coronavirus, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Friday.   Another 2,335 persons were in quarantine on Friday because they have been in contact with infected persons. The figures come from 21 cantons and Liechtenstein.  Thanks to contact tracing and spot checks among passengers arriving by air, several cantons have been able to detect people not respecting the quarantine rules, a survey by the SDA-Keystone news agency found. However, it did not give figures, and the possible number of unreported cases is not known.  A week ago, the FOPH said it would start carrying out spot checks on 20 to 30 flights per week to verify compliance with the quarantine obligation on return from a risk country.   As of Thursday, data on nine flights had been passed on to the cantons, spokesman Daniel Dauwalder said on Friday, and further lists would follow this week. Starting next week, bus connections would also be included in the samples, he told Keystone-SDA.   Since July 6, anyone entering or returning to Switzerland from a risk country has had to go into quarantine. Those affected must report to the cantonal authorities no later than 48 hours after entering the country.  Anyone who fails to comply with this obligation to report risks a fine of up to CHF10,000. In the case of negligent infringement, the maximum fine is CHF5,000.  Since the virus hit Switzerland, around 33,500 people have tested positive for the virus and almost 2,000 have died. From its March peak, the number of new cases fell to around a dozen in early June, alongside a drop in hospital cases and deaths.  But since the easing of the semi-lockdown from mid-June, the number of new cases has been slowly creeping up. The FOPH on Friday reported 154 new cases over 24 hours and six deaths. 
2020-07-24;Coronavirus outbreak hits two Swiss summer camps;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-outbreak-hits-two-swiss-summer-camps/45922116;Coronavirus has been detected in 30 more people in the eastern canton of Graubünden after an outbreak at a summer camp on Thursday. Head of the Graubünden health department Rudolf Leuthold told Swiss television SRF there is a high probability that these infections are also related to the youth camp and numbers could rise.  About 250 people are in quarantine in connection with the youth camp, he said on Friday. The outbreak began at a camp for 9-to-13-year-olds in Parpan near Lenzerheide when seven of the 100 participants became infected and two people were hospitalized.  The local health department announced on Thursday that 80 of the 100 young people lived in canton Graubünden. Before symptoms appeared, some campers had already moved on to another camp – which was immediately called off, and its 30 participants sent into quarantine. The Graubünden health department has ramped up protection measures to prevent the further spread of Covid-19. For example, business owners and event organizers have to check the accuracy of the contact data they collect – including full names and phone numbers. This data must be stored in electronically maintained lists. Since the virus hit Switzerland around 33,500 people have tested positive to the virus and almost 2,000 have died in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.5 million. From its March peak, the number of new cases fell to around a dozen in early June, alongside a drop in hospital cases and deaths. But since the easing of the lockdown from mid-June, the number of new cases has begun to slowly creep up in different parts of the country. There were 117 new cases reported in Switzerland on July 23. Over the past couple of weeks the average number of new cases has been around 100 per day. On Friday it was also announced that 305 people had been placed into quarantine after somebody tested positive for coronavirus after visiting the Kapitel Bollwerk nightclub in Bern last Saturday. 
2020-07-24;More job cuts as Covid-19 hits business ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/more-job-cuts-as-covid-19-hits-business-/45924686;More Swiss firms are announcing job cuts after the coronavirus crisis hit their business in the second quarter of the year.  Swiss lift maker Schindler announced on Friday that it would be shedding 2,000 jobs worldwide in the next two years, including 200 in Switzerland. This came as it announced first half results down on the same period last year, although better than analysts had expected. The firm said the job cuts were part of a cost-cutting plan because of the “negative impact of Covid-19 on business”.  Also announcing lower results on Friday, the Sulzer industrial group confirmed it plans to cut 55 jobs at three of its Chemtech sites in Switzerland.  The global economic downturn caused by the pandemic and the resulting market distortions have led to the need to adjust our capacities in two group companies in Switzerland, Sulzer said.  And airport technical services firm SR Technics plans to shed up to 500 jobs as a result of the crisis, according to the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper, including at Zurich, Geneva and Basel airports.  This comes after some Swiss companies in other sectors also announced plans to shed jobs. For example, German tour operator TUI said earlier this month it would close eight of its 62 branches in Switzerland with the loss of around 70 jobs, owing to the effects of the coronavirus crisis. And at the end of June, Swiss tour operator Hotelplan announced it was cutting around 430 jobs, including 170 in Switzerland.    
2020-07-24;‘No point in staying here’: Swiss expats head home for schooling amid pandemic ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-abroad-return-for-children-s-schooling-amid-pandemic/45919222;Many parents are wondering what their children’s schools will look like next term – virtual or in-person? How many days a week? Things are clearer in Switzerland, where schools largely reopened in May. That has some Swiss families living abroad considering a return to their homeland for their children’s education. Doris S. left her native Switzerland 27 years ago to travel to the United States. She met her husband there and decided to stay. Now, they live in California with their two children, ages nine and 14. When the coronavirus pandemic broke out in the US, schools closed and classes continued online. In California, it is not certain when the schools will reopen, and the children have been attending online classes since mid-March. “We weren’t considering moving to Switzerland for our children’s education until about two months ago,” Doris says. When the local school district informed the parents that the governor might cut back on school funding and that public schools were considering staying closed for the fall semester, she picked up the phone to call her father in Switzerland, and they started to plan their move so her children could go to school there. Doris kept a video diary, and SWI visited the family after they arrived: Returning for a school year or for good? Anne M. and Monica B. have similar stories. Both moved from Switzerland to the US many years ago and started families there. Like Doris, they have been considering returning to Switzerland for their children’s education for a while. Both Anne and Monica say that the coronavirus situation has brought a lot of uncertainty and that their children struggle because of not being able to interact with their peers and because online classes are not very effective. “There will be a big meeting soon, and if the schools decide to go ahead with more distance learning, then I don’t think there will be any point in staying here,” Anne says. Her move to Switzerland would not be permanent, but rather for a semester or up to a year. Clara G. lives in Panama with her five-year-old daughter. Working in the tourism sector, Clara is currently out of a job. Like in the US, the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a strict lockdown, with schools closing and few options to leave home. Clara had been thinking about returning to Switzerland with her daughter before the pandemic hit Panama and is now considering it more seriously to provide her daughter with a Swiss education. If she decides to move, it will be for good. Like Clara, Franco C. is considering returning permanently from his current home in Indonesia, where he also works in the tourism sector, to his native Ticino. “It is really difficult to decide what to do right now for my son and his education,” Franco says. His 18-year-old son just finished high school and Franco is considering a return so his son can attend a Swiss university during the pandemic, with the plan of staying there until graduation. ‘In Switzerland, everyone hikes 24/7’ But what will the move to Switzerland be like for the kids? “My youngest son thinks that everyone is hiking, 24/7,” Doris says with a laugh. Her children, as well as the others we spoke with, know Switzerland from vacations and stories. These families hope that sending their children to schools and universities in Switzerland help them become more immersed in Swiss culture and discover more about their Swiss roots. The children will also be attending school in another language. This will likely be manageable, since Doris’s and Monica’s children are attending dual-language schools in the US while Clara and Franco speak their native Swiss languages with their kids.  Anne’s kids attended a German summer school. All of the families we spoke with are considering public school for the time the children would be in Switzerland. For Franco and his son, the language will be a challenge in choosing a university. “My son speaks English and Italian, finding a university here with a curriculum in one of these languages will be difficult,” he anticipates. Fears and uncertainty While the others are still in the decision and planning phases of their moves, Doris and her family acted quickly and relocated to Switzerland last week. She has found an apartment in a town in canton Zurich, where she has friends and relatives living nearby. After the required 10 days of quarantine, she will continue organising her children’s school year. Since Swiss school offices were closed for vacation while they were still in the US, Doris decided to travel first and then contact the schools in question from Switzerland. Her husband will have to return to the US for work, and it’s unlikely that he will be able to come back to Switzerland for holidays. This means the family will be separated, and Doris hopes that in the case of an emergency they would be able to find a way to see each other again. Anne and Monica are also worried about being separated from family. Monica can’t work remotely over many months, so if they decide to make the move, her husband will go to Switzerland alone with the kids. “Being separated for that long wouldn’t be easy,” she says. As they decide whether to relocate, Franco and Clara also worry about the job situation. They expect finding work in the tourism sector to be tough and find the idea of starting over daunting after having lived and worked abroad for so long. “In any case, I will keep the doors back to Panama open,” Clara says, “just in case it doesn’t work out in Switzerland”.
2020-07-24;‘Fear of being forced to leave Switzerland is growing’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-fear-of-being-forced-to-leave-switzerland-is-growing-/45922946;Many immigrants in Switzerland have been hard hit by the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. New regulations mean that many fear taking welfare. It’s a situation that needs to change, says integration expert Francesca Chukwunyere. In January 2019, the Federal Act on Foreign Nationals and Integration was revised to extend the requirements for granting residence permits. For example, social security offices are obliged to report the names of people who receive benefits to cantonal immigration officials. Depending on an individual’s situation, authorities can decide to withhold annual residence permits or downgrade a permanent residence permit, Chukwunyere explains. The ethnologist is deputy director of the isaExternal link immigration advisory centre in Bern. swissinfo.ch: What is currently the greatest concern among foreigners who come to your organisation for advice? Francesca Chukwunyere: Falling into poverty and the fear of having to leave Switzerland as a result. The pandemic has highlighted and aggravated a problem that has been festering for some time – the amendments to the Federal Act on Foreign Nationals and Integration mean that many people decide against taking welfare because they are afraid that this will put their residence permits at risk. swissinfo.ch: Who are you talking about exactly? F.C.: People who are employed on relatively insecure terms. These are the large proportion of the foreign labour force who are in temporary work arrangements, or the so-called “working poor”. So families with a low income which are absolutely reliant on two or three incomes to feed their children. These people feel the effects of the pandemic two or three times over. They are the first to be made redundant or have their working hours cut. A single mother who is paid by the hour as a cashier, for instance. Or the bricklayer on low wages.  They are migrants who are now afraid of losing their residence permits. swissinfo.ch: How do they avoid this in the middle of an economic crisis? F.C.: Some avoid taking any kind of social benefits, so not just direct income support, but also supplementary benefits such as discounts for health insurance or support for childcare for which people on low incomes are eligible. These payments may be calculated as social welfare in some cantons, although that is not the norm. This has led to a lot of insecurity among foreigners. They don’t want to do anything wrong or take any risks because for most of them, maintaining the right to stay is their highest priority. We should not forget that since January 2019, social security offices are obliged to report the names of people who receive social welfare or supplementary benefits to cantonal immigration officials. And depending on an individual’s situation, these authorities can decide to withhold annual residence permits from foreigners, or replace a permanent residence permit with an annual one. The change in the law even affects foreigners who have lived in Switzerland for more than 15 years. swissinfo.ch: What can your organisation do to ease these concerns? F.C.: We have to explain time and again what is allowed under the law and what not. However, we are not always sure ourselves what is allowed, because this new law leaves municipalities and cantons a lot of room for manoeuvre. There are circumstances which are not regulated down to the last detail. And the law can be interpreted in diverse ways. So far, very few cases have been addressed by the Swiss Federal Court. So there is some legal uncertainty for us, too. We aren’t always 100% sure that what we think we have understood is valid. The same goes for colleagues at other advisory centres and social services offices. swissinfo.ch: What would create more clarity? F.C.: There will only be clarity when cases come to court. And this is difficult, because if a foreigner takes an immigration authority to court, then he is, in a sense, challenging the state that has taken him in. We believeExternal link that it is absolutely essential to suspend residence procedures connected to social welfare and the Foreign Nationals Law for the time being, until the crisis caused by the pandemic is over.
2020-07-23;SWISS to speed up airfare refunds;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-to-speed-up-airfare-refunds/45923046;Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) plans to speed up the refund process for airline tickets purchased via travel agencies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The company announced on ThursdayExternal link that it was aiming to process all refund requests made before the end of June by the end of August. “On July 27, 2020, SWISS will reactivate the refund functionalities in all reservation systems (GDS) for travel agencies,” it said. The automatic online refund function had been adapted in order to prevent possible fraud, it added. It stressed that many of the earlier airfare refunds had been paid out. SWISS had come in for criticism from travel agencies for failing to promptly refund tickets for flights that were cancelled or could not be taken by passengers due to the pandemic. In the event of cancellations such as those prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Swiss package tour operators are legally obliged to provide refunds. But Thomas Stirnimann, the chief executive officer of the Hotelplan travel agency group, complained in May that SWISS was not repaying the travel agents fast enough. SWISS told swissinfo.ch at the time that it was indeed refunding individual customers as well as agencies, but that these payments were taking longer than usual due to the high demand. In May, the Swiss parliament approved a credit of CHF1.875 billion ($1.92 billion) to support SWISS and other aviation companies that ensure vital transport infrastructure for the Swiss economy. 
2020-07-23;Is it time to say goodbye to exotic leather watch straps?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-exotic-leather-watch-straps-/45920350;Straps made from alligator or other reptile skins have become a mainstay of Swiss luxury timepieces but a ban in California is forcing a rethink.  September 2019 was a great month for animal rights groups. Legislators in California decided that a long-awaited ban on the sale of alligator and crocodile skin would come into effect from 2020. It was bad news for alligator hunters and farmers in Louisiana and Florida, as well as luxury retailers in Beverly Hills selling crocodile and alligator skin shoes, belts and handbags who lobbied against the ban. Shops in California selling high-end Swiss timepieces with alligator straps were also worried about their inventory.   “Some brands sent in replacement straps to put on stock watches, and some brands did not address it at all,” says Jamie Hays of the Feldmar Watch Company which has shops in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.   The situation became even more complicated when two last-ditch lawsuits against the California ban were filed at the last minute: one by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the other jointly by a group of Louisiana alligator farmers and California luxury retailers. As a result, the ban was temporarily put on hold and the final decision hangs in the balance with the coronavirus pandemic potentially affecting court hearings scheduled this year.   “It was very anticlimactic in the end.  We all had plans to be prepared for the worst, and at this point there is nothing to do,” says Hays.   There is still a fair chance that proponents of the ban will win in the California courts. Of course, watch collectors could always drive to a neighbouring state to buy a Swiss watch with an alligator bracelet. But California’s pioneering policies - from marijuana legalisation to introducing a minimum wage - often influence the rest of America and even the rest of the world. At the very least, the California ban has alerted Swiss watch brands to the financial risk of continuing with a strategy of “business as usual”.    “Luxury brands are ditching animal-derived materials, including exotic skins, in response to growing consumer demand for sustainable and ethical products,” says Sophia Charchuk of the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) which lobbied hard for implementation of the California ban. “Any brand that doesn't want to be left behind by the largest shopping demographic—Gen Z and millennials, who opt for cruelty-free products—should ban exotic skins.”  Many high-end brands have said no to exotic reptile skins in recent years. For example, London upmarket retailer Selfridges announced that they would no longer stock products that use exotic skins like alligator, crocodile or python from February 2020 onwards. However, watch straps appear to have escaped their notice. As of July 1, Selfridges’ online store was selling 13 luxury Swiss watches with alligator straps: six Vacheron Constantin models, three Zenith, two Longines, one Girard-Perregaux and one Carl F. Bucherer.  When confronted by animal rights groups on the ethics of using exotic straps, Swiss watch brands claim they only use sustainable sources that do not endanger the survival of a species. In 2010, the Swatch Group - which owns luxury brands like Omega, Breguet and Longines - stopped using leather straps from crocodiles, snakes, rays, and sharks but alligator still accounts for around 10% of all leather straps.   Our use of so-called exotic leather is limited to the Alligator mississippiensis species, which is sourced from very few, clearly identified, controlled, and sustainable farming operations in southeastern US states,” says a Swatch Group representative.   However, PETA is not convinced that animal welfare is a priority at these alligator farms.   “Alligators killed for their skin are raised in crowded, dark sheds and fetid water before they're stabbed in the spine,” says Charchuk.  Shocking images that emerged in 2010 from Indonesia showing pythons and lizards being skinned alive led to a reflection on the sourcing of reptile skins from abroad. Last year, under the leadership of Switzerland, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) adopted guidelines for humane killing of reptiles in the leather industry for the first time. It was the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office that initiated and then led the drafting of the “Killing of reptiles for their skins, meat and other products” chapterExternal link in the OIE’s Terrestrial Animal Health Code which was then formally adopted. The recommendations deem certain inhumane killing methods like freezing, boiling, suffocation, drowning or live skinning unacceptable.   Not surprisingly, PETA wants all killing of reptiles for leather to stop. The organisation wants luxury companies to switch to alternative materials.    “Sustainable, eco-friendly vegan materials and recent textile advances—such as plant-based polymers and recycled polyurethanes as well as materials made from cork oak bark, pineapple leaves, mulberry leaves, and mushrooms—are revolutionising the fashion market and proving that we don't have to sacrifice style in order to be kind to animals and the planet,” says Charchuk.  The problem in the watch industry is not so much the lack of alternatives but a question of image. The exotic leather strap has become an important luxury element of a high-end Swiss watch. The Swatch Group told swissinfo.ch that there is a “strong customer demand” for these alligator leather straps. Some Swiss watch brands have adopted the potential compromise of crocodile and alligator-embossed straps which look like the real deal but are made from cow and calf leather.   But whichever path the watch industry chooses to take on materials for its high-end straps, the pending California ban shows that ignoring the issue is not an option anymore. The Swiss watch industry can ill afford another hit given that the value of watch exports has fallen by over a third in the first half of this year largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
2020-07-22;‘I'm not allowed to go outside’: How one artist sees Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-i-m-not-allowed-to-go-outside---how-one-artist-experienced-switzerland/45899608;What's it like to be a Palestinian artist-in-residence in Switzerland in the time of coronavirus? Lama Altakruri, 38, shares her observations of Swiss daily life in words and images.  For the first half of this year she lived and worked in the town of Aarau, northern Switzerland. The artist residencyExternal link provided by the Association Gästeatelier Krone presented an opportunity for Altakruri to work away from the restrictions and pressures of her everyday life in Palestine. A residency is about providing the time and space for a guest artist to develop work and explore new ideas. It is an invitation to spend time in a new atmosphere and environment. For AltakruriExternal link this was a chance to advance some of her earlier work and to develop a new project, which was presented at an exhibition at the Forum Schlossplatz in AarauExternal link. An equally important aspect is the exchange with Swiss artists and networking with Swiss curators, galleries and institutions. Much of this has been difficult to achieve over the past six months. Once the Covid-related restrictions came into effect in mid-March, many of the usual activities like visiting other artist studios or the many exhibitions and museums became impossible and Altakruri faced unexpected challenges. The following are her observations and notes on Swiss daily life, which resemble extracts from her diary. This small collection of texts is entitled Awkward Interactions: The lockdown started where you live, but here it hasn’t, yet. I close all the news pages and I go downstairs. People are sitting outside at the restaurants' tables. They look relaxed. I have to walk between the tables to be able to leave my building. I walk to the riverside, I hope a few people are there, but not a lot. A lot of people are there. When I go back, I have to walk between the tables to be able to enter my building. A dog runs towards me, I run away, the dog runs behind me, the dog’s owner runs behind the dog, I run behind the dog’s owner. I shout: “Is it gonna bite me?” he says: ”no she is not gonna bite you, she is playing with you, if you freeze she’ll stop.” Easier said than done. My heart is still racing, he talks to me to calm me down. “Where are you from? Oh, Palestine! It’s a place that gets mentioned a lot. Maybe neighbouring countries should give land to Palestinians so they can move there.” Maybe I should’ve asked him if they can move here. I met my neighbour only once, but I know a lot about him, things I shouldn’t know, but our wall is too thin, and his voice is too loud. I know what time he goes to work and what time he comes back, I know about his long distance relationship, I know they fight a lot. There is a little cupcake shop near me, the shop is pink with two white chairs outside its door. I enter the shop and ask to buy a cupcake,  she tells me that they have only one left, it’s a cheesecake cupcake, my favorite. She puts it in a little white box, I give her my money, she apologizes, she can’t accept cash, card only, because of the pandemic. I don’t have a card right now, I apologize and I leave behind the cheesecake cupcake in the little white box. A man on the street stops me, he asks if I like to read, I say yes, he asks in what language, I say English or Arabic, he goes to the table and comes back with a heavy book, he says it’s about a new technique for the brain, and here is our website. I look at where he points and I recognize the word Scientology, I tell him I can’t buy the heavy book, but I will look at the website, He asks where I am from, I say Palestine, he says: “I was close, I was in Israel, many times, many times.” I don’t know why he said it twice. We stand in front of the food scale at Coop, he is an old man, he says that he is Canadian. I let him weigh his bag before I weigh mine. He puts his bag on the scale, he looks at me and opens it, he grabs one piece and shows it to me, he says: ”this is called passionfruit, try to pick the ugly ones, they taste better, you open it with a knife and eat it.” I approach the counter and ask the cashier how to self serve in this self-service restaurant. She says: “So, you choose a pie from here, then a coffee from there, then you come back here and pay, after you finish, you return this thing there, what do you call it?” I reply: “a tray?” she says: “Yes, tray.” The train station is almost empty, I’m waiting for my train and a man is hovering around me while speaking angrily to himself. My train is coming in 20 minutes, I can’t stand here longer while this man is walking back and forth in front of me. I wonder what he will do next, is he angry at himself, will he become angry at me. There is a Starbucks on the platform, maybe it would be better to go there and wait, I order a Tall Coffee, the barista says: ”here, we call it Café Crème”. I hear that there is an urgent call for a moment of global meditation, some kind of an astrological portal will open, millions will meditate together to end the 5G network and erase the virus. They will also dissolve the world structure. Will they succeed? Will they crash the internet? Will I lose contact with you? This talk about meditation makes me anxious! All the dolls in the toys museum are looking at me, they make me feel like a stranger entering someone’s private space. A lot of them are in their miniature shops, interrupted and frozen while selling fabric, cutting a piece of meat, or baking sweets. In one shop, a doll sells other dolls. In a different section, I peek into the dolls’ houses, a doll family is having a meal together, while a doll is sitting in the bedroom. In another house, a doll maid is hanging the laundry in the attic, while another one is giving a doll baby a bath. I realize that I like dolls' houses better when they are empty. For the first time in my life, I faint. I’ve been sick for two weeks now. I’m used to getting sick, but I never faint. I call the emergency line and they send an ambulance. Two paramedics shake my hand. In the hospital, a young doctor also shakes my hand. In my hospital bed, I hear an old woman behind the curtain, she sounds in pain, I don’t know what she wants, she keeps repeating the same words, I don’t understand her language, I don’t know what to do, I can’t move.  
2020-07-22;Swiss humanitarian trade deal with Iran faces delay, questions  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-humanitarian-trade-deal-with-iran-faces-delays--questions--/45906142;Swiss “good offices” between Tehran and Washington have brought about a humanitarian aid channel allowing Swiss-based companies to send medicines and other vital goods to Iran despite US sanctions. But it remains to be seen to what extent the now-delayed deal will help the Iranian people versus Swiss political and economic interests.  The channel, known as the “Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement” (SHTA), was facilitated by Swiss “good offices” between the US and Iran. It comes amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit Iran particularly hard, and as Switzerland and Tehran mark 100 years of diplomatic ties.  Iran is seen by many countries as a sponsor of terrorism and a potential nuclear threat. United States-led sanctions since the Islamic revolution of 1979 have taken a severe toll on the economy and have recently been tightened under the Trump administration.   But whilst other countries have broken diplomatic ties, Switzerland has always had a policy to “talk to all countries”, as former Swiss State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pascale Baeriswyl told swissinfo.ch last year. In addition, Switzerland represents the diplomatic interests of the US and Saudi Arabia in Iran, and of Iran in Saudi Arabia and Canada.  Swiss ties with Iran are maintained at the highest level. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Bern in 2018 and in May 2020 Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds Switzerland’s rotating presidency this year, spoke with Rouhani on the phone.   “In view of the 100th anniversary of Switzerland’s diplomatic presence in Iran, we discussed bilateral affairs, the pandemic and our arrangement for exports of humanitarian goods,” she tweeted.   Washington announced on February 27 that the SHTA was “fully operational” but Iran’s private Tasnim News Agency (pro-regime) ran an article on May 9 entitled, “Iran gets nothing from Swiss Humanitarian Channel”. It said that the “moribund state of the channel contrasts with the fanfare with which the Trump regime announced it” and that “knowledgeable observers say the way the channel is structured places substantial burdens in the way of companies looking to sell Iran humanitarian supplies”.  Asked whether the SHTA was operational, the Swiss foreign ministry blamed its delay on the coronavirus.   “Unfortunately there have been delays due to Covid-19,” it said in a July 13 email to swissinfo.ch. “Interested companies, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, were faced with other priorities overnight. However, we would also like to emphasise that a number of companies have already been approved and that first transactions should be carried out shortly.”  The ministry had said in June that “interested Swiss export and trading companies are in the process of collecting the necessary information and documents and preparing them for submission to SECO [Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs]. After successful examination by SECO, the companies can start processing the transactions.”  SECO declined to say which companies had been approved or to give further details. However, trial operations of the channel began in January, during which Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Novartis supplied Iran with €2.3 million (CHF2.4 million) worth of cancer drugs and medicines needed for organ transplants.   “For the benefit of Iranian patients, Novartis worked with the Swiss and US authorities and Banque de Commerce et Placements [Swiss bank] to achieve a first payment channel transaction for the shipment of three lifesaving drugs: Sandostatin LAR (used to treat certain types of cancer), Myfortic and Neoral (both immunosuppressants),” Novartis told swissinfo.ch.   But the pharmaceutical firm declined to say more, adding only that “the spring 2020 launch of the Swiss payment channel for commercial shipments of medicine may improve Iranian patient access by increasing the predictability and stability of the future supply of medicine to Iran.”  The SHTA is a payment mechanism to enable the delivery of humanitarian goods to Iran and is “available to Swiss firms in the food, pharmaceutical and medical sectors”, according to the Swiss economics ministry. “Under the SHTA, the US Treasury Department will provide the banks involved with the necessary assurances that financial transactions can be processed in accordance with US legislation.”   This comes in the wake of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.   “Since the US withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran in May 2018 and reintroduced unilateral sanctions, it has become increasingly difficult for Swiss exporters to supply humanitarian goods to Iran, although such shipments are in principle not subject to US sanctions,” the economics ministry explained in a February 27 press release. “Due to the legal risks associated with US sanctions, hardly any financial institutions were willing to make payments in connection with Iran. The few remaining payment channels were expensive, complex and not very reliable.”  With Iran suffering from decades of economic sanctions and now the pandemic, the deal is supposed to ensure that “humanitarian goods continue to reach the Iranian people , as US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on February 27. But it remains to be seen whether it will ultimately be a success and who benefits most -- the Iranian people or Swiss companies.   
2020-07-21;Ticino firms to get CHF2,000 bonus for hiring apprentices;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/ticino-firms-to-get-chf2-000-bonus-for-hiring-apprentices/45917730;Companies in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino – which has been hard hit by the coronavirus crisis – will get CHF2,000 ($2,100) for each new apprentice they train, the canton has said. The move comes following Swiss-wide concerns that young people were failing to find apprenticeships due to the lockdown earlier this year and the economic impact of the coronavirus. Around two-thirds of young people take the vocational route in Switzerland. School-leavers usually sign contracts for apprenticeships that start in the first week of August. The Ticino bonuses are part of the package of measures known as “Più duale Plus”, canton Ticino said on TuesdayExternal link. There will be CHF2,000 for each new apprenticeship training contract concluded until October 31. And it will also be paid out to companies that take on apprentices in their second, third or fourth year of training, who had to change their training companies. The aim, the canton says, is to “confirm the commitment to training apprentices during a difficult time for the canton’s entire economy”. It wants to create 2,500 extra apprenticeships for the next school year. Canton Ticino has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus due to its proximity to Italy. In May the government set up a Task Force “Perspective professional apprenticeships 2020” following concerns that young people were finding it hard to find vocational training places. Latest figures released by the task force show that by the end of June, 55,000 apprenticeship training contracts had been signed, which is 3% less than in June 2019 But while the situation in the German-speaking part of the country was found to be relatively stable, the number of contracts signed had dropped significantly in the French- and Italian speaking parts of the country. This is largely due to the later recruitment phase in these areas, which came during the lockdown and meant that young people were not able to actively look for apprenticeships as they would normally do (by doing taster days, going for interviews). Cantons are also taking matters into their own hands. Earlier in July, several cantons joined together with businesses to create a last-minute apprenticeship platform to point young people to training openings. Others have extended the period for signing apprenticeship contracts to autumn and/or offered coaching and extra advice to young people looking for their first training jobs.
2020-07-21;How Swiss schools abroad are adapting amid Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-swiss-schools-abroad-are-adapting-amid-covid-19/45908998; Situated in some of the world’s coronavirus hotpots, Switzerland’s 18 official schools abroad have been hard hit by Covid-19 school closures. Now they are looking to the future. “They all had to change very quickly to distance learning, especially in China and Italy. They were not prepared for such a radical step as school closures in these countries came unexpectedly,” said Barbara Sulzer Smith, director of the Swiss schools abroad body educationsuisse. She noted that other schools where outbreaks happened later had a bit more lead time and could draw on the experience of the Chinese and Italian schools. As school closures happened around the world - also in Switzerland for two months – there was a great deal of pressure for the fee-paying Swiss schools abroad to carry on with classes, according to Sulzer Smith. A special challenge was keeping up pupils’ German, as many only learn it at school. EducationsuisseExternal link therefore started the DigiDeutsch programme to link upper secondary school pupils in Switzerland – many without much to do during lockdown – with pupils in Italy and Spain for conversation lessons. It was also difficult to establish whether Swiss teachers working abroad should stay or return to Switzerland. “Some of our teachers wanted to go back to Switzerland but it was our position that they should stay in their countries because we needed to know that they could come back when schools reopened,” Sulzer Smith said, noting that a few teachers did have to go back because of difficult circumstances. In addition, financial pressure on the schools is now “massive”, according to the educationsuisse director. Some parents wanted fee refunds, while others were not able to pay anymore due to the economic impact of the coronavirus. Sulzer Smith estimates that pupil re-registration for next term is down by 10% on average. Italy has been at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, with more than 244,000 cases and 35,000 deaths. The Swiss School Rome closed as part of a nationwide lockdown on March 5. Staff worked hard to get homework out to the pupils for the next week and to educate themselves further about digital tools. “Distance learning started just 10 days later,” headteacher Claudia Engeler indicated. The Swiss School Rome is preparing to re-open on September 9, as part of Italy’s easing of pandemic measures, with social distancing of two metres between teacher and pupil and one metre between the pupils. “But we can only really act once we have the guidelines from the Italian government. These could vary right up to just before school begins – depending on the number of new infections,” Engeler said. Latin America is still in the midst of the pandemic. In the Colombian capital, Bogota, home to the Swiss school Colegio Helvetia, the mayor has ordered strict, rolling two-week quarantines in certain neighbourhoods. (The capital has 32% of the country’s nearly 134,000 cases, according to Reuters). The Colegio Helvetia closed on March 13. The government changed its mind overnight on the issue of school closures, but the school still managed to get its Helvetia en Casa distance learning project out to its pupils “in record time”, as it states in the latest educationsuisse newsletter. In some cases, the school used school buses to drop lesson plans to younger pupils. It was however, “a steep learning curve” for all, the newsletter says. The school year would normally restart on August 18. The Colegio hopes for a slow return to on-site teaching, but school co-head Cedric Schuppisser told swissinfo.ch that this will involve at most a “fifty-fifty approach” until the end of 2020. This means half of the pupils will be at home with the rest at school, swapping each week. Meanwhile, in China the government has imposed such tough requirements on schools to re-open, like health checks on staff and pupils as well as structural measures, that it’s very difficult to fulfil them all, Sulzer Smith said. So it’s not yet clear what will happen to the Swiss School Beijing, the newest Swiss school abroad, which is part of a larger international school. Another problem: the new Swiss teacher due to travel to Beijing cannot get a work permit, so cannot enter the country. With all these uncertainties, the next few years are likely to be very challenging, especially financially, Sulzer Smith said. The Swiss schools are not alone: other international schools, like the German onesExternal link, are also suffering due to the coronavirus crisis. However, the Swiss government has said it will step in with some extra funding for the schools, Sulzer Smith said. But if there has been one positive effect of the coronavirus closure, it’s the fact that being forced into distance learning has – as teachers in Switzerland have found as well –  “certainly moved us a big step forwards in the digital area,” as the Colegio Helvetia’s Schuppisser puts it. Some of those changes might be here to stay. On July 23, 2020 the article was amended with the latest figures for Italy.
2020-07-20;New Swiss technologies listen out for Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-swiss-technologies-listen-out-for-covid-19/45908738;"Two promising innovations under development use artificial intelligence to predict whether someone has coronavirus by analysing their coughs or breathing patterns. Coughs have been a valuable diagnostic tool for centuries. Today, being able to say whether you have a tell-tell dry Covid cough or a harmless hack is a crucial – perhaps life-saving – test. In the future, this could be done digitally using the “CoughvidExternal link” smartphone app, an AI-based system being developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). The idea is simple. You are worried you may have the virus and you want to check before contacting a doctor. Using the app, you make a recording of your cough at home, then submit it online after answering a few basic health questions. Algorithms automatically study your recording, looking out for distinctive patterns to determine whether you have a dry, persistent “Covid cough”. A diagnosis is sent back instantaneously. An EPFL student came up with the idea after reading World Health Organization (WHO) information that a typical dry cough was a sign of infection found in two-thirds of patients. “If you listen closely, you can hear that there’s a clear chirp in the Covid cough which is recognisable,” explains EPFL scientist Tomas Teijeiro. Analysing coughs is not new, said his colleague David Atienza, a professor of EPFL’s School of Engineering and another member of the Coughvid development team. Doctors already listen to patients’ coughs to diagnose whooping cough, asthma and pneumonia. “With Coughvid we want to offer large-scale, convenient and reliable screening. It’s an alternative to conventional tests,” said Atienza, who added that it was not a substitute for medical examinations. The wider objective is to reduce the number of people going to the doctor, demanding a test when they don’t exhibit the symptoms. Medics’ reactions to the invention have been mixed. “Some say that if you can simply filter 20-30% of people coming to hospital that can be very helpful,” said Teijeiro. “Some were very enthusiastic; they want us to commercialise it tomorrow. Others said it would never work and they would never use it as it doesn’t cover everyone … But even among the most sceptical, everyone says it’s worth exploring as it’s cheap and easy to set up.” So far the team has collected over 19,000 cough recordings online. But they need more samples to train the app to distinguish between the coughs of people with Covid-19, healthy people and people with other kinds of respiratory problems. Teijeiro has been working with Swiss doctors to analyse and validate some of the recordings. But this has revealed certain inaccuracies between what is self-reported online – whether the person feels sick or not – and the reality verified by doctors. A clinical validation via a trial will nonetheless be required before releasing the app to the general public. No release date has been set. The current situation is paradoxical, said Teijeiro, as they need the number of Covid cases to rise – allowing them to acquire more data – for the project to advance. “The app is almost ready. It’s connected to our servers and we can do the tests, but until we do the medical validation, we cannot release it,” he said. “We’ve done the whole protocol with the doctors. We’re just waiting for when they get patients, when things get worse.” Coughvid was voted one of the three best ideas at a recent EPFL coronavirus hackathon. But the app is not unique. Scientists are currently working on four similar projects at universities in Cambridge and New York, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Beyond substantial press coverage, Teijeiro said a number of companies had approached them to commercialise it and the WHO is also interested in integrating the idea into its own app. Meanwhile in Geneva, scientists at the University Hospital (HUG) External linkare developing a comparable idea: an autonomous intelligent stethoscope that analyses breathing patterns to help determine whether someone has Covid-19 or other respiratory illnesses like pneumonia. All lung diseases have different acoustic signatures, explains Alain Gervaix, head of the Department of Women, Children and Adolescents at the HUG. “The sounds of asthma are different from those of pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Like the Shazam music app, which can recognise a song and its author and title, we’re using AI algorithms to find the acoustic signatures of each of these illnesses,” he explained. The doctors want to add Covid to that list. Since the outbreak of the disease they have collected and analysed thousands of recordings of Covid patients. They are presently collaborating with a team at EPFL and the University of Applied Sciences (HEPIA) in Geneva to build a prototype device that should be ready at the end of September. On paper it resembles a small pot of face cream rather than a traditional stethoscope. “You won’t even need to have anything in your ears,” explains Gervaix. “You place the device on the patient’s thorax. Their breathing is recorded via an internal microphone. The device records, analyses and displays results on a smartphone or tablet.” The stethoscope should enable a better early screening of Covid patients who require an expensive test. Anyone with the virus could use the device to regularly check themselves, said Gervaix. By monitoring changes in breathing, the algorithms could tell them – and their doctor via an automatic alert – if they are getting better or worse. The project is moving ahead and a number of interested parties are lining up. Gervaix said he had been in touch with the Swiss NGO Terre des hommes about using the device in poorer countries. Chemists in Switzerland are also interested, as the Swiss government wants pharmacists to become frontline health actors in the future. “Covid has changed medicine a great deal,” said Gervaix. “It has separated the patient from their doctor rather than bring them closer together. But Covid has also revealed how telemedicine has become much more important. Telemedicine is starting to show its true capabilities.”"
2020-07-19;Will Switzerland experience a baby boom in the time of corona?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/will-switzerland-experience-a-baby-boom-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-/45913632;With the country in lockdown in spring to curb the spread of Covid-19, some people have predicted a rise in the birth rate and a new baby boom. A Swiss newspaper points to a surge in pregnancy tests. According to SonntagsBlick newspaper, there are strong indications that a coronavirus-induced baby boom may be underway. “We have been experiencing a rush of pregnancy tests since the end of February,” Frank Marent, managing director of the online pharmacy McDrogerie.ch told the newspaper on July 19. At the online site microspot.ch, more than three times as many pregnancy tests have been sold since the beginning of the lockdown compared to the same period last year. And in April and June, the Coop supermarket also reported a high number of pregnancy tests sold in their branches and at the Coop pharmacy Vitality. The pharmacy chain Pura Vita said it had sold twice as many tests between mid-March and mid-July as in the previous year. Sonntagsblick said Zurich's Zollikerberg hospital had indicated a possible increase in the number of pregnancies. “In our consultation hours, we have noticed a clear increase in the number of enquiries, with over 30% more pregnancy care being provided,” head physician Nadja Pauli told the Sunday paper. The Swiss Society for Gynaecology and Obstetrics, meanwhile, was cautious. “Whether there is a baby boom will only be determined based on nationwide birth figures,” said Secretary General Thomas Eggimann. However, some initial studies do not support the possibility of a lockdown baby boom. A studyExternal link of data from a survey conducted among 18-34-year-olds in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK found that the effect of the pandemic on fertility intentions was negative. And a separate studyExternal link of global sexual habits carried out by the Kinsey Institute from mid-March to mid-May found that nearly half of those surveyed said they had sex less frequently and enjoyed it less during the pandemic. Justin Garcia, a sex researcher at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, told the Financial Times that he thought there would be no baby boom to show for those two months of lockdown. “People report pretty high rates of feeling stressed and worried, and those are not psychological states conducive to sexuality,” he said.
2020-07-19;Report finds most returnees from Covid-19 risk countries avoid quarantine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/report-finds-most-returnees-from-covid-19-risk-countries-avoid-quarantine/45913460;Less than half of all people returning to Switzerland from countries that are considered “high risk” for possible coronavirus infections are complying with quarantine rules, according to a news report. Since July 6 anyone entering Switzerland from a country or area with an increased risk of infection must spend ten days in voluntary quarantine and report their arrival to the relevant cantonal authority within two days. The list of 29 countries can be found hereExternal link. However, the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday that less than half of all returnees were actually doing so. Its survey of 16 out of 26 cantonal authorities revealed that since July 6, some 6,000 people had flown into Switzerland from at risk countries via Zurich, Geneva and Basel airports. Yet only 2,300 had gone into home quarantine voluntarily. Canton Zurich recorded 600 people in quarantine, followed by Vaud (290), Bern (220) and Basel (170 cases). Larger cantons such as Aargau, St Gallen and Ticino were unable to provide any statistics, NZZ said. These total figures do not include people entering the country by car or bus from at risk countries. NZZ pointed out that, for example, Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) currently operates ten flights a week from Zurich to Stockholm, Sweden, seven weekly flights to Belgrade, Serbia, and New York, United States, four to Tel Aviv, Israel, and three to Sao Paolo, Brazil. All of these destinations and countries feature on the Swiss authorities’ Covid-19 “at risk” list. Anyone not keeping to quarantine may risk a fine of up to CHF10,000 ($10,600). On July 17, a Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) spokesperson said that the Swiss authorities were starting to conduct unannounced random checks of travellers returning from risk countries to ensure they are complying with quarantine rules. The government has started to request passenger lists from airlines – around 20-30 flights a week – and will also demand lists from bus companies from next week. Around one in ten new infection cases comes from people returning from abroad, the FOPH said. Rudolf Hauri, president of the cantonal doctors' association, told NZZ am Sonntag he wasn't surprised by the report and quarantine numbers. But he insisted that systematic random samples must be carried out to monitor the quarantine regime. Travellers returning to Switzerland from at risk countries are generally notified of Swiss quarantine rules during their flight, on board coaches and at border crossings. They have to register with the cantonal authorities on arrival. Airlines and travel companies are also be instructed not to transport sick passengers. The public health office plans to regularly update its list of the risky regions. Full information about entering Switzerland and quarantine rules can be found hereExternal link (French and German).
2020-07-17;Pressure to wear masks at schools mounts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pressure-to-wear-masks-at-schools-mounts-/45911362;Around 100 upper secondary school teachers have written to the authorities in the western Swiss canton of Vaud calling for masks to be worn at school next term. This comes after canton Lucerne said it would make mask-wearing compulsory for certain schools.  Earlier this week, Lucerne became the first Swiss canton to announce that older pupils and staff would likely wear hygiene masks at school after the summer holidays to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. The decision would affect Baccalaureate schools and vocational schools.  Canton Jura is reportedly also considering the move, as are a number of other cantons. The Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, which was hard hit by the coronavirus and borders Italy, said this week that it planned to make masks compulsory for all schoolteachers in the corridors and the staff room, but not in class. Pupils would not have to wear the face coverings.  In Switzerland cantons are in charge of educational matters and can decide which measures to take for the beginning of the autumn term.   On March 13, the Swiss government took the unprecedented move of ordering the nationwide closure of all schools. Whereas primary schools mostly went back to full class teaching after reopening on May 11, this was not the case for most pupils in post-compulsory schooling like vocational and baccalaureate schools, who are aged over 15-16 (and who were only allowed back to school in small numbers from June 8, leading many of these schools to continue with distance learning until the summer holidays.)   “The inspiration for the letter came to us after several weeks of teaching half a class at a time. We saw that it took twice as long to make progress with our pupils… We are afraid that when [autumn] term starts, the same thing will happen again,” Laurent Carraz, who teaches at the Bugnon Baccalaureate school in Lausanne, told Swiss public television RTSExternal link.  The letter calling for a mask recommendation was sent to Vaud education minister Cesla Amarelle, who replied on the same day that she favoured upper secondary schools going back to full-class teaching and that wearing masks was one of the options being considered, RTS reported. Vaud has yet to make a decision on the issue.  Other cantons have also yet to pronounce on the measures they will take next term.  The University of Fribourg also plans to impose a compulsory face mask rule from the start of the autumn semester, SRF has reported. 
2020-07-17;Lausanne hospital test chosen for coronavirus study ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lausanne-hospital-test-chosen-for-coronavirus-study-/45910590;A Covid-19 antibody test developed at Lausanne university hospital (CHUV) has been chosen for wide-scale studies of the Swiss population, the hospital has announced.  Selection of a single serology test was necessary for consistent and comparable data at national level, CHUV said on Thursday.   The hospital announced in June that one of its teams had developed a new coronavirus antibody blood test in collaboration with the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and the Swiss Vaccine Research Institute.   Compared to other commercially available tests, the technology developed at the CHUV has a 15-30% higher sensitivity, making it possible to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 long after infection, even in people with few or no symptoms, CHUV said in a press release.  Corona Immunitas, the government-backed antibody testing programme, has now chosen it for nationwide tests. Supported by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), Corona Immunitas is in charge of coordinating more than 20 population studies to estimate the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland.   Such studies are very useful from an epidemiological point of view and may also help determine immunity levels to the virus.   
2020-07-17;Swiss ease Covid entry rules for 21 countries;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-ease-covid-entry-rules-for-21-countries/45910138;Switzerland will relax coronavirus-related entry restrictions for 21 further countries, including Australia and Canada. The changes apply from July 20. “Switzerland remains cautious and only relaxes its entry restrictions with restraint,” the Swiss justice ministry wrote in a twitter postExternal link on Thursday. This means Montenegro stays on the list of “at risk” countries for which entry and quarantine restrictions still apply, it added. According to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), the new rules from Monday apply to travelers from Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. European Union states Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania, whose citizens have been allowed to enter Switzerland since June 15, have also been removed from the list of risk countries. Also included are Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican. Covid-related border controls were lifted at all land and air borders between Switzerland and the Schengen states on June 15. The Swiss government had already said at the beginning of July that it planned to lift the restrictions for the 21 newest countries, to follow a recommendation by the EU. Switzerland is not part of the EU but has bilateral agreements in place with it. “All other countries are still considered high risk. Entry restrictions continue to apply to persons entering Switzerland from these countries,” the SEM said on its website. This includes the United States. The list “will be revised as and when required,” it added. In addition to these entry restrictions, since July 6 anyone entering Switzerland from a country or area with an increased risk of infection must spend ten days in quarantine and report their arrival to the relevant cantonal authority within two days. The list of 29 countries can be found hereExternal link. Those not keeping to quarantine, may risk a fine of up to CHF10,000 ($10,600), Swiss officials have said. Meanwhile the first figures from several cantons in Switzerland show that people are generally keeping to the at-risk country quarantine rules, Swiss public television, SRF, has reportedExternal link. In cantons Geneva, Vaud, Basel City, Thurgau and Graubünden just under 900 travellers are currently in quarantine. In canton Zurich 600 people had registered. “This shows that many people are acting responsibly. But the figure also shows that many are not registering with the authorities and are not going into quarantine,” the Federal Office of Public Health (OFSP) said. For example, 16 planes from risk countries landed in Zurich, Geneva and Basel on Thursday, which means a conservative estimate of at least 1,000 people a day from these countries coming into Switzerland, SRF said. Some may have travelled on to other countries. An OFSP spokesperson said on July 17 that the Swiss authorities is conducting unannounced random checks of travelers returning from risk countries to ensure they are complying with quarantine rules. The government has started to request passenger lists from airlines – around 20-30 flights a week – and will also demand lists from bus companies from next week. Around one in ten new infection cases comes from people returning from abroad, OFSP said.
2020-07-16;Departure of OSCE head a setback for dialogue and negotiation ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/departure-of-osce-head-a-major-setback-for-dialogue-and-negotiation-/45908190;"Thomas Greminger's departure from the European security body shows that Swiss ideals of neutrality and humanitarianism are being challenged in the multilateral system, Daniel Warner argues. What is the difference between politics and neutrality/humanitarianism? Political theorist Michael Walzer, in a famous 1973 article titled “Political Action: The Problem of Dirty Hands,” argued that getting one’s hands dirty in politics is inevitable. For Walzer, and many others, politicians and politics are fundamentally dirty. (We know that diplomats are jokingly referred to as honest people who are paid to lie for their country). Neutrality and humanitarianism, on the other hand, are supposed to be apolitical, hence clean and above the fray. Switzerland’s neutrality has always been considered its strength. The small Alpine country punches above its weight in international affairs because it is seen as being independent. During the Cold War, this independence was especially appreciated by the major powers, as witnessed by the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva at the height of the conflict in 1985. Geneva, Switzerland was neutral territory. Switzerland touts itself as an apolitical country. That is why it took so long for the Swiss to agree to join the United Nations. One should never forget that Switzerland was only the 190th member to join the UN, after 55% of the population voted in favor of joining in 2002. Previous popular votes had failed because the citizens worried about losing neutrality. Switzerland’s apolitical stature has also allowed it to act as “good offices” in situations like freeing American hostages in Iran. It is also why there is considerable reluctance for Switzerland to have an eventual non-permanent seat on the Security Council, a most political body. But while Switzerland prides itself on its neutral independence and humanitarianism, there are moments when political infighting rears its ugly head beyond Swiss control. Thomas Greminger is currently paying that price. As secretary-general of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the former head of the Swiss Foreign Ministry’s human security division was supposed to be a shoo-in for re-election. He had done an outstanding job as the Swiss representative to the OSCE during the Swiss chairmanship in 2014 as well as secretary-general from 2017. No one has questioned Greminger’s competence. What has been called into question is the political infighting within the organization. The 57 members are supposed to make decisions by consensus. And reaching consensus requires political acumen. Ambassador Greminger has walked that tightrope in negotiating between Moscow and Washington on such sensitive areas as Ukraine. But what happens when the internal politics of the organization overwhelm consensus and competence? What happens when internal OSCE concerns outweigh merit? As we understand, the government of Azerbaijan strongly objected to the re-election of Harlem Désir, who, since 2017, has served as the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and who has consistently criticized Azerbaijan’s government. And because they blocked his re-election, the French and some other countries decided to block Greminger’s re-election as well as that of three other department heads.   The situation may be temporary. Greminger could be re-elected after negotiations. But what is not temporary is the politicization of the major, inclusive European security organization. The history of the OSCE is one of continuing dialogue and mediation even during the Cold War. It has no permanent army; the OSCE functions by moral persuasion. The non-re-election of Thomas Greminger is not only a setback for the OSCE, but it is also a major setback for dialogue and negotiation. Unfortunately, the departure of the highest-ranking Swiss in the international system also shows how the Swiss ideals of neutrality and humanitarianism are being challenged across the multilateral system. As with the coronavirus pandemic, one must continue to wash one’s hands these days. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch."
2020-07-16;Pandemic dents finances of Swiss doctors;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-dents-finances-of-swiss-doctors/45907850;Two-thirds of doctors’ surgeries in Switzerland expect to end the year with financial losses as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Some 42% said income has been “significantly” eroded as a result of people staying at home during the lockdown rather than visiting their doctor with ailments. A survey of more than 12,000 physicians by the Swiss Medical Association in May found that workloads significantly increased for around one in ten respondents. But a third experienced a significant drop in work in March, rising to nearly half in April. As a result, 4% of respondents said the financial hit threatened their very existence. More than a third had to put staff on short-time work while a small minority had to lay off some workers. Of the respondents, 282 said they had contracted COVID-19. This is a higher infection rate (2.3%) than the general population, but the report points out that a greater percentage of doctors were tested. A quarter of doctors said they belonged to an “at risk” group as defined by the health authorities. Around a third of the surveyed doctors said they had been in contact with infected or potentially infected patients at least every other day in March. That figure had dropped to 12% by the mid-May. Just over a quarter said they had never been in contact with infected patients during the same time frame. The availability of protective equipment, such as face masks and disinfectant, was a problem at the start of the pandemic, with well over half of respondents reporting shortages.

Investigations found that other manufacturers of mechanical watch movements – the mechanisms that make timepieces tick without a battery – have emerged over the past few years, according to competition commission president Andreas Heinemann. “Alternative suppliers of Swiss-made mechanical watch movements have effectively won ground,” he said at a press conference on Wednesday. “This means watchmaking companies have become less dependent on Swatch’s ETA unit.” However, the commission cautioned that ETA remained dominant due to its production capacity and must not abuse this position. The ruling is subject to appeal. Under the deal struck in 2013, ETA had to phase out movement deliveries due to its strong market position but would no longer have an obligation to supply parts to other watchmaking companies. The regulator in January imposed restrictions on Swatch Group, saying it needed more time to determine the impact of market liberalisation. The announcement prompted angry reaction from Swatch which threatened to sue the authorities for damages. It is the latest stage in a long-standing conflict between Switzerland’s biggest watchmaker and its main competitor in mechanical watch movements, Sellita, and comes amid concerns that Swatch Group could use the new freedom to win back customers from alternative suppliers. Experts say such a risk may have increased during the coronavirus pandemic as collapsing watch demand led to production overcapacity across the watchmaking industry. Earlier this week, Swatch Group announced a 46% decline in sales and its first ever net loss the first of the current year.
2020-07-14;Swiss Solidarity raises CHF40 million for most vulnerable affected by Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-solidarity-raises-chf40-million-for-most-vulnerable-affected-by-covid-19/45902612;"The humanitarian charity Swiss Solidarity is helping over 100 groups to provide emergency assistance to the elderly, the homeless and other vulnerable people who have been struggling in Switzerland during the coronavirus pandemic. Since launching its campaign in March, Swiss Solidarity has raised nearly CHF40 million ($43 million) and passed on CHF24 million to fund 115 aid projects around the country. Another CHF16 million is slated for distribution in September. About half of the people in need live in Switzerland’s five largest cities: Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich. Some 46% of the money has provided financial relief; 22% has been spent on services, for example, for the elderly or people with disabilities; 16% has purchased food for the needy; and 15% has contributed to coordination and communication efforts. Caritas Switzerland and the Swiss Red Cross are among the 11 national and 93 local groups ensuring that the funds are used correctly. Swiss Solidarity is the humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, swissinfo.ch’s parent company. Contributions to the special fund for those affected by Covid-19 in Switzerland can still be made via the website (www.glueckskette.chExternal link) or the postal account 10-15000-6, using the reference “Coronavirus”.

2020-07-14;Swiss remain stressed despite lockdown easing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/despite-the-end-of-lockdown--the-swiss-report-more-stress/45902170;"Even after the step-by-step easing of the lockdown, many Swiss felt more stressed than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic, a survey by Basel University has found. The study also shows an increase in cases of depression. Is my coughing a symptom? Would I survive an infection? How do I best prevent contagion? With such concerns flying around, it’s not surprising many people experienced stress during the coronavirus lockdown in Switzerland. But even as measures to contain the pandemic were gradually being eased, many Swiss were still much more stressed than before Covid-19 appeared on the world stage. This is revealed in a comparison of two surveys by Basel University. The first was done during the lockdown in early April; the second, between May 11 (when restaurants, among other establishments, could open again) and June 1. But despite the different time frames, the results were similar: during the lockdown, exactly 50% of respondents said they were more stressed than before the pandemic; and even after the easing, the figure remained at 40%. “It amazed us that the figure was similar to during the lockdown,” Dominique de Quervain, who oversaw the study, told Swiss public television, SRF. “We would have imagined that in the period when restrictions were being eased, stress would also decrease considerably.” De Quervain is the director of the Department for Cognitive Neuroscience and a member of the national Covid-19 Task Force. “Among the main causes of the increase in stress – as before – are the insecurities caused by changes at work or in apprenticeships and a restricted social life,” the study’s authors wrote. Marcel Tanner, president of the Swiss Academy of Sciences and leader of the public health experts’ group in the Task Force, sees such findings as key. “It is important that we also address psychological health problems when we look at the coronavirus crisis, because they determine how our social networks function and therefore our economy too,” he told SRF. But the most recent survey also shows there were even some who experienced lower stress levels during and after the lockdown – as many as 32% said that this was the case. Why? “The reduction in stress levels in these cases arose from the increased time for leisure and fewer commitments relating to work, school or private life,” the statement from Basel University says. Another survey finding was that people who suffered symptoms of depression before the crisis also experienced more severe symptoms during the easing period. According to the authors, previous underlying psychological problems – present before the coronavirus – increased the risk of developing heavy symptoms during the crisis. According to the survey, around 3% of the population suffered from serious depression before the pandemic. The latest survey shows that proportion rose to 12% during the crisis. The authors also asked participants about their resilience – meaning their ability to ward off depressive symptoms. In particular, people of middle age and older (55 and above) and men accounted for a higher proportion of the group who had no significant symptoms of depression. “This is amazing, because older people and men are particularly in danger if they fall seriously ill as a result of the virus,” the authors wrote. Meanwhile, the second survey confirmed which group of people on average suffered lower increases in stress during the pandemic: those who had more time to spend on a hobby or a new project, and those who were physically active."
2020-07-14;Swiss minister attends France’s Bastille Day ceremony;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-minister-attends-france-s-bastille-day-ceremony/45902144;"Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset is among several European dignitaries invited to France’s July 14 celebrations in Paris. This year’s commemoration honours those who participated in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Berset was invited to the national day ceremony by French President Emmanuel Macron alongside dignitaries from Germany, Austria and Luxembourg as a sign of France’s recognition of their cooperation during the health crisis. The invitation follows Switzerland’s decision to welcome 52 French patients suffering from Covid-19 to Swiss hospitals from the end of March to the beginning of April, as many French facilities were deluged with patients. For Frédéric Journès, France’s ambassador to Switzerland, this offer of collaboration during the pandemic will have an impact on future relations between the two neighbours. “We are completely interdependent; we need each other. We’d come to take that for granted. During this crisis, we’ve been forced to talk to each other all the time. Alain Berset and [French Health Minister] Olivier Véran spoke to each other regularly and sent each other text messages. [Swiss Interior Minister] Karin Keller-Sutter also spoke with our interior minister on a much more regular basis than usual. We had a lot of exchanges and we got to know each other better than usual,” he explained. The fight against the new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 30,000 lives in France, is the main focus of the official event in central Paris. Instead of the traditional grandiose military parade, this year’s Bastille Day ceremony – France’s biggest national holiday – is celebrating heroes of the coronavirus pandemic instead. Guests include nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians and others who kept France going during its nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also have a place in the stands. “This ceremony will be the symbol of the commitment of an entire nation,” Macron said in a speech to military officials on Monday. “It will also be the symbol of our resilience.” Meanwhile, at the Place de la Concorde in central Paris, protesters plan to highlight France’s failures during the pandemic. Medical workers and others who complained of mask shortages and cost cuts are expected to demonstrate. The protesters are due to head the Place de la Bastille, the former home of a royal prison that rebels stormed on July 14, 1789, symbolically marking the beginning of the French Revolution. At Tuesday’s main ceremony, fighter jets are set to paint the sky with blue, white and red smoke and will be joined by helicopters that transported Covid-19 patients in distress. A military band will sing the Marseillaise national anthem to 2,000 special guests."
2020-07-14;Swiss launch ‘democratic’ hygiene mask production;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-launch--democratic--hygiene-mask-production/45899244;The production of protective face masks should be decentralised and made more democratic, according to two Swiss campaigners. They hope their initiative can prevent cases of fraudulent and ruthless practices by the business community. Marie-Claire Graf, one of the sponsors of the Swiss-led project, says it is highly unethical to try and make a lot of money with health products used to fight the spread of Covid-19. “The issue of exorbitant prices and falsified certificates has taken on a political dimension,” says Graf. The 24-year-old Swiss is an expert on sustainability and a member of the youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Together with other activists, she has been talking to producers, experts on certification and other interest groups, in an effort to organise a special business venture. The project is being launched as face masks become a commodity in many countries, which are trying to soften the impact of a possible wave of coronavirus infections. The Swiss government made hygiene masks mandatory for passengers using public transport at the beginning of July, while some young entrepreneurs reportedly made millions by importing protective gear from China and selling them to the Swiss armed forces during the first wave of the pandemic three months ago. The Protective Mask Initiative aims to provide machines for the production of hygiene equipment to governments and institutions as well as private companies and individuals who have submitted an application. As part of the package, they will also receive basic materials, including fleece fabric, filters and elastic bands at no cost. Participants in the venture will have to undergo a certification procedure for the masks. If the products pass the test, they are free to sell their products at prices they set themselves. In addition, they will have to pay a small fee to the initiative group for the use of the machines. Graf says the idea is to establish a decentralised production system to “enable everybody to manufacture masks on their own”. The first wave of coronavirus infections has shown that a central production system has failed, she adds. The first franchise holder is Germany’s main mask manufacturer. The Berlin-based firm ordered a dozen machines and is about to launch production. The masks are destined for major German and international companies, including an airline and a retail chain, she says. Graf has teamed up with economist and author Oliver Fiechter to approach business partners in Switzerland, notably local authorities, cantons and the armed forces, as well as hospitals and major private firms. It is crucial to get the project started as quickly as possible, as a second wave of the Covid-19 infections is imminent, according to Graf. The initiative has received about 100 requests from Europe and elsewhere, she says. Stakeholders are from the United States, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt. The venture has taken off like a rocket, says Graf. A first series of 30 machines is almost fully booked. The initiative group therefore aims to increase the number of machines leased out to 300 in the weeks and months to come. The money from the production is re-invested in extending the project. Graf says the initiative group has shouldered several risks. Not only are they providing the funds for the investment, but they will also have to be liable financially in case of damage to a production machine. Loss of fees - if a franchise holder is unwilling or unable to pay – is another risk. If the initiative gathers speed, it hopes to let underprivileged regions of the world have a direct benefit. “We are currently considering plans with UNICEF [the UN international children’s fund] which countries could take part in our project,” says Graf.

2020-07-14;Swiss cantons move forward on obligatory masks at schools ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/canton-lucerne-to-introduce-masks-in-upper-secondary-schools/45902040;Older pupils in the central Swiss canton of Lucerne look set to be the first to wear hygiene masks at school after the summer holidays to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Jura and other cantons may follow suit. In Switzerland cantons are in charge of educational matters and can decide which measures to take for the beginning of the autumn term. “To protect the health of pupils and staff in Baccalaureate schools and vocational schools in the most efficient way possible – while at the same time having full-time face-to-face teaching – there should be a general obligation to wear masks, also during breaks and in the corridors,” canton Lucerne education department spokeswoman Regula Huber told swissinfo.ch by email on Tuesday, confirming a report that had appeared on Swiss public television, SRFExternal link. “There will not be compulsory mask wearing in settings in which the distance rule of 1.5 metres can be maintained (big rooms, small groups, sports lessons).” The education and culture department will make a definitive choice about how schools should start the new term in August, she added. “As long as there is no change to the corona situation, there should basically be compulsory mask wearing,” she wrote. The move comes because the canton wants to go back to face-to-face teaching for older pupils after the nationwide school closures due to Covid-19 earlier this year – in Baccalaureate schools and vocational schools they are all over 15-16 years old. Primary schools had gone back to class teaching before the holidays, as elsewhere in Switzerland, as primary pupils (under-12s) are not considered primary transmitters of the coronavirus by the Swiss authorities. On March 13, the Swiss government took the unprecedented move of ordering the nationwide closure of all schools. Compulsory schoolsExternal link (kindergartens, primary schools and lower secondary schools for pupils aged 12-15) re-opened on May 11 (some cantons re-opened fully, some had staggered schedules at first, in another example of cantons deciding their own measures). Higher education establishments, as well as upper secondary and vocational schools followed on June 8, although in practice many of these schools continued with distance learning until the summer holidays, also because they were only allowed to teach smaller groups of pupils. According to SRF, canton Jura in the French-speaking part of Switzerland is also considering compulsory mask wearing for older pupils, but no official decision has yet been made. SRF said that according to its research, ten further cantons were discussing masks for certain schools. The cantonal conference of educational directors (EDK) - which represents the cantons in education matters – said that there was no obligation to wear marks in Swiss schools and it was up to the cantons to decide on which measures they take. There is no recommendation on masks planned from the EDK, spokesman Alexander Gerlings told the Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA. The University of Fribourg also plans to impose a compulsory face mask rule from the start of the autumn semester, SRF reports. In principle, every second seat in lecture halls and seminar rooms should remain free, as well as the front row of seats in order to protect the lecturers. If a minimum distance cannot be maintained, masks will become compulsory in lecture halls and seminar rooms. The rule will come into force on August 1. According to Radio Fr, Fribourg will become the first Swiss university to introduce such a rule on hygiene masks. The decision follows guidelines drawn up by the University Rectors' Conference.
2020-07-14;Swatch sales plummet as company hopes for post-pandemic rebound;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swatch-hopes-watch-sales-to-pick-up-quickly-after-coronavirus-pandemic-slump/45901814;Swatch Group said it expected sales and profits to improve quickly in the months ahead after the coronavirus pandemic caused a “massive decline” in business for the first half of the year. The watchmaking industry has been hit hard by the pandemic this year as stores closed across Asia, Europe and the United States. Swatch recorded a drop in sales of -46.1% to CHF2.2 billion ($2.34 billion) in the first six months of 2020, it said in a statementExternal link on Tuesday. It posted a net loss of CHF308 million, after a net profit of CHF415 million francs in the previous year. However, Swatch said the group had returned to a positive operating result in June. It said it was observing very high demand in markets which had come out of lockdown, including double-digit sales growth in mainland China in May and June. “The Group’s management is convinced that the sales and profit situation will improve quickly in the coming months, parallel to the further easing of Covid-19 measures in the countries,” it said. “This positive outlook is strengthened by new products which will be launched in the second half of the year, as well as the lower cost base. This will lead to increased production capacity in the third and fourth quarter 2020.” Swatch said it expected a positive operating result for the full year. Despite the postive outlook, Bloomberg news agency reported on Tuesday that Swatch Group had cut 2,400 jobs, a record cull, and trimmed its store network due to the financial pressures. The company said it had accelerated plans to shut stores permanently in Hong Kong as well as shops that sell its Swatch brand and Calvin Klein timepieces.  The job cuts were mainly at stores, as Swatch held on to production workers, Bloomberg reported. The company closed 260 stores and now has about 1,800.
2020-07-13;Swiss watchmaking: where things stand;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-watchmaking--where-things-stand/45896950;"Heavily impacted by the coronavirus crisis, watchmaking nonetheless remains a symbol of Swiss know-how and “Made in Switzerland” precision manufacturing. Can it keep up its dominance in the luxury sector and compete against the likes of Apple? A primer on a key Swiss industry which exports its products all over the world. Switzerland produces just over 20 million watches per year, or just over 2% of global timepiece manufacturing. However, it commands more than a 50% share of the global watch industry in value terms, with turnover for all Swiss brands combined estimated at more than CHF50 billion ($53 billion) in retail sales value. In the high- and mid-range segments, Switzerland leaves just a few crumbs for its French or German competitors: more than 95% of watches sold for CHF1,000 or more are produced by Swiss companies. In recent years, the average value of exported Swiss watches has continued to climb, reaching around $1,000. Multiply that number by two or three and you have an idea of the average price payed by clients who wear those watches. In contrast to the spectacular success of Swiss watchmakers in the luxury market, the drastic fall in the total number of watches manufactured is a trend that worries many industry specialists. In 2019, Swiss watchmakers exported almost 10 million fewer watches than they did in 2016. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic will see sales decline to just 14 million watches in 2020. Such dismal figures take the industry back to volume sales equivalent to those of the 1940s. Aside from competitive difficulties, the watchmaking industry is facing significant structural challenges. The first amongst them is competition from smartwatches —notably the Apple Watch — which has delivered a heavy blow to “Swiss Made” watches in the entry-level segment (under CHF200). Apple alone sold more watches in 2019 than the entire Swiss watch industry, although the company only began selling watches five years ago. The celebrated Swatch brand has been the hardest hit by the downturn in volume, with estimates by Swiss public broadcaster RTS suggesting that the brand today produces between three and seven million watches annually, compared to some 15 to 20 million produced during its heyday in the 1990s. Together with entry-level brands such as Mondain, Festina, Victorinox or even Raymond Weil, Swatch has also been hit by the introduction in 2017 of tough new rules governing the attribution of the “Swiss Made” label. The new rules forced the brands to use more components made by Swiss suppliers which in turn forced them to increase prices, with the result that sales volumes declined by several hundreds of thousands of units. “If, by the age of 50 one does not own a Rolex, one has failed at life,” goes the celebrated quote uttered by French advertiser Jacques Séguéla more than a decade ago and which still serves to illustrate the outsized symbolic dimension the Rolex brand occupies within the luxury universe. Rolex timepieces adorn the wrists of personalities from Roger Federer to Brad Pitt, Donald Trump or Jay-Z. It is also the best-selling Swiss watch brand with an estimated turnover last year of more than CHF5 billion. At least, that is the figure estimated by the American bank Morgan Stanley and Swiss consultants LuxeConsult. Because while Rolex has developed an unparalleled notoriety across the globe, it also operates its business with total discretion. Privately owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation (founder of the brand) Rolex is not listed on the stock exchange and its securities are not negotiable. It is an arrangement that enables the Geneva-based brand to control its communications in the manner it sees fit, outside of transparency rules imposed by stock markets. There are some 350 watch brands which bear the “Swiss Made” label but they are far from all operating in the same league. The top five most powerful brands together account for a 50% share of watch sales. Behind the untouchable Rolex are Omega (Swatch Group, CHF2.34 billion per year), Longines (Swatch Group, CHF1.65 billion), Cartier (Richemont, CHF1.59 billion) and Patek Phillippe (CHF1.35 billion). The exclusive club of billionaires is completed by Tissot (Swatch Group, CHF1.05 billion) and Audemars Piguet (CHF1.03 billion). Alongside the successful independent brands — Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille — three companies dominate the Swiss watchmaking market: Watchmaking accounts for around 1.5% of Swiss gross domestic product (GDP). It is the country’s third-largest export industry behind the pharmaceuticals and machine tools sectors. Its companies are mainly located in Neuchâtel, Bern, Geneva, Solothurn, the Jura and Vaud cantons where the industry generates more than 90% of the sector’s added value. The watchmaking industry is a major generator of jobs in these regions, with the 700 companies active in the industry employing nearly 60,000 people. When indirect employment linked to the sector is added, it is estimated that nearly 100,000 Swiss jobs are dependent on the watchmaking industry. But the salaries earned by the industry’s employees are much more modest than the value of the timepieces they work to produce. In 2018, the average salary in the watchmaking industry was just over CHF5,400 per month; that’s CHF1,000 less than the average salary of the country’s workers. The watch sector peaked at the end of the 1960s, when it counted almost 90,000 employees in 1,500 companies. In the early 1970s, however, the arrival of Asian-made quartz watches disrupted the market and sent the Swiss watchmaking industry into a profound crisis. By the mid-1980s, just 30,000 employees in around 500 to 600 businesses had survived the crisis. Switzerland’s watchmaking industry was revived by the production of mass-market models, especially by Swatch watches. Beginning in the 2000s, this was followed by exponential interest from emerging markets in luxury models. As a result, by 2019, Swiss watchmaking generated more than CHF21 billion annually in exports. The coronavirus pandemic has nonetheless delivered a brutal blow to the smooth operation of the industry. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FH) estimates exports will decline by 25% to 30% in 2020, making it worst economic crisis in the sector’s history. The Epinal image of the Jurassian watchmaker bent over his workbench with a magnifying glass is still widely used in publicity materials by the industry. The reality, however, is much less bucolic. Since the 1960s the Swiss watchmaking industry has enlisted cheaper foreign workers to power its factories. At that time, workers were often Italian women recruited to undertake the repetitive actions of the assembly lines. Today, many cross-border workers from France are employed in watchmaking factories located in western Switzerland’s Jura Arc, the historic cradle of the sector. In this region, they account on average for one in three employees, a proportion which can reach more than 80% in factories situated close to the French or Italian borders. Historically, Switzerland’s watchmaking industry owes its very existence to foreigners, thanks to the French Huguenots (Protestants) who fled their country in the wake of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685. During the 2000s, the progressive opening of the Chinese market provided a massive boost to Swiss watch exports to the Far East. Since then, the value of watch exports to China has been multiplied by a factor of 100. When shopping tourism is included, it is estimated that approximately one in two “Swiss Made” luxury watches is purchased by a Chinese customer. But China’s economic slowdown, the anti-corruption campaign instigated by Xi Jinping — watches are greatly appreciated gifts amongst the regime’s officials — and the political crisis in Hong Kong have put an end to the honeymoon period between Swiss watchmakers and China."
2020-07-11;Swiss Abroad want to keep freedom of movement;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-abroad-want-to-keep-freedom-of-movement-_swiss-abroad-want-to-keep-freedom-of-movement/45896780;The Swiss Abroad community opposes an initiative of the rightwing Swiss People’s Party (SVP) seeking to curb immigration from the European Union into Switzerland. The SVP initiative, which reflects worries among some Swiss about immigration in general, demands that the government scrap the freedom of movement agreement with the EU within a year. Accepting such an initiative would be disastrous for Switzerland and the 460,000 Swiss citizens who live in the EU, the Congress of the Swiss Abroad said on Friday. The freedom of movement agreement between Switzerland and the EU allows Swiss citizens to work and settle in any country of the bloc, noted the organisation. Restricting these rights would hamper the mobility of all Swiss and damage Switzerland as a business destination, it added. For Swiss people abroad, geographical and occupational mobility, the coordination of social security systems and the right to remain in the EU after finishing their professional activity are essential. In total, there were 770,900 registered expatriate Swiss in 2019. Most Swiss Abroad citizens live in Europe, notably in neighbouring France, Germany and Italy. The Swiss will vote on the SVP initiative on September 27, the first nationwide vote since the start of the coronavirus crisis.
2020-07-11;Martin Suter: when the writer becomes the story;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/martin-suter--when-the-writer-becomes-the-story/45894582;Martin Suter is one of the most prolific Swiss writers. His work spans novels, screenplays, theatre plays, songs, short stories, and newspaper columns. Success permitted him to live between Ibiza, Morocco, Guatemala, and his hometown Zurich, where we caught up with him.  Suter is in Switzerland right now to revisit his past and present in a docufiction that carries his name. In it, the writer also explores scenes of some of his fictional body of work, meeting the characters he created, reenacted by professional actors. “My books are not about me, I try to keep out of my books”, said Suter, during a break in the shooting of the film. But being the author, Suter concedes that his words are the product of what his eyes see.  Suter has always been a keen observer of the Zurich elite and its mores – not losing sight of the underclasses over which this elite steps on. He gained local prominence when he decided to leave behind a successful career as creative director of an advertising agency to pursue literary work, including his online column, Business Class, in the late 1990s.  The column was a fictional but stinging chronicle of Switzerland’s managerial upper strata. Business Class first appeared in Weltwoche, a weekly with antifascist roots in the 1930s, before its more recent rightward turn.  The column then moved to the Tages-Anzeiger, where it appears in the paper’s weekend supplement. It also turned into two books before he took a hiatus of more than a decade. In 2018, Suter resurrected the column on his website. The business elite, he pointed out in the interview, hasn’t changed even after the financial crash of 2008 and the coronavirus pandemic. The commercial success enjoyed by his books did not win him many compliments from the critics. But it is the plot that makes his stories so gripping, rather than their characterizations or social awareness. But these are not necessarily literary sins. Suter’s characters struggle with identity crises and life’s twists and turns, and his sets – be it a restaurant kitchen or a prestigious law office – are crafted not in lengthy descriptions, but through the interactions of his characters. The choice of names for his characters is also very peculiar, even for a French or English reader. There’s the lawyer Blank, who goes through a mid-life crisis and develops personality disorders after consuming psychedelic mushrooms. His counterpart, a sexless, amoral and impious business shark goes by the name of Pius Ott. And then there’s the detective Johann Friedrich von Allmen, the protagonist of a series of six books that Suter has worked on over the last ten years. The aristocratic preposition “von” is an obvious joke for German-Swiss ears since Allmen denotes a lowly, commoner’s status. When asked about the names of his characters, Suter smiled. “I never thought of my names carrying any special meaning,” he said. “I just wanted to make them short and easy to be pronounced in translation”.  One thing, though, is clear: Suter is a writer who loves all of his characters, so much so that the concept behind the production filmed right now in Zurich doesn’t sound too far-fetched.  But from what we could see on the set, the narrative could prove challenging. If it works out or not, we will see next autumn, when the film is scheduled to debut on the silver screen. 
2020-07-10;Basel study: hydroxychloroquine not effective;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/basel-study--hydroxychloroquine-not-effective/45895486; Basel scientists have confirmed that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the HIV medication lopinavir do not work against Covid-19. The concentration of the two drugs in the lungs is not sufficient to fight the virus. In February 2020 the University of Basel and the University Hospital Basel started to monitor a range of diagnostic means and potential treatments for Covid 19, including the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir. In particular, the research group investigated how the virus-induced inflammation affected the concentration of lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine in the blood. Scientists also worked out how high the concentration of both drugs must have been in the lungs - the main infected area for Covid-19. Results strongly suggested that it was unlikely that both drugs reached sufficient concentrations to inhibit the virus replication in the lung, a Basel University statement said on Friday.External link The study, which has been published in the Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal, confirms the view taken by the World Health Organization (WHO). On July 4 it decided to discontinue trials of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 after the drugs failed to reduce mortality. Manuel Battegay – co-leader of this study and head of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology at the University Hospital in Basel – said that the results of the Basel study provided important pharmacological and antiviral insights to the rationale of discontinuing the lopinavir/ritonavir trials. “In fact, they explain why hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir are not effective against the SARS-CoV-2,” the statement said. Hydroxychloroquine has been caught in a political debate after United States President Donald Trump promoted it, even though there was no scientific evidence that it helps against the new coronavirus. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who on Tuesday announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19, said he was taking hydroxychloroquine. He has previously urged his government to make the malaria drug widely available and encouraged Brazilians to take it, both to prevent the disease and to treat it.
2020-07-10;Can big pharma’s money solve the antibiotics crisis?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/can-big-pharma-s-money-solve-the-antibiotics-crisis-/45893430;More than 20 major pharmaceutical companies are investing nearly $1 billion (CHF940 million) in a fund to bring new antibiotics to patients. But some say it’s merely a band-aid for underlying problems in the industry. This is the first time a fund to address a public health issue has been created exclusively by a group of pharmaceutical companies, including Swiss firms Novartis and Roche. Launched on Thursday, the so-called Antimicrobial (AMR) Action FundExternal link aims to bring two to four new antibiotics to market in the next decade.Thomas Cueni of the Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), which brought the pharmaceutical industry together to back the venture fund, said it was “a historic and unique initiative for more than 20 pharma companies to step up and address a major public health crisis”. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led bacteria to develop defenses against the drugs, creating the need for new antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some 700,000 people die every year from antimicrobial resistance, and it’s expected that if new drugs don’t come on the market, some 10 million worldwide could die by 2050.The announcement of the pharmaceutical fund during the coronavirus pandemic underlines the gravity and urgency of the crisis. Antibiotics use is on the rise as prolonged hospital stays among Covid-19 patients raise the risk of bacterial infections. Speaking at the launch event for the fund, WHO Director General Tedros GhebreyesusExternal link called antibiotic resistance  a “slow tsunami that threatens to undo a century of medical progress”. The timing also reflects the position big pharma has found itself in during the pandemic: praised on the one hand for developing vaccines and treatments, while demonised on the other for not investing enough in tackling infectious diseases. The antibiotics crisis is part of a larger problem facing the for-profit pharmaceutical model where drugmakers avoid research and investment in certain public health issues that don’t offer attractive returns for shareholders. “This is a new model for public-private partnerships, using private sector investment to address public health challenges with guidance from the public sector,” said the WHO’s GhebreyesusExternal link on Thursday. Cueni underscored that the fund is not about pharmaceutical companies cross-subsidising themselves and there is no intention for big companies to make money on their investments. The fund is a welcome step forward for global health authorities. Discussions have been ongoing for years at global and regional levels on how to bridge the financing gap to prevent the antibiotics pipeline from drying up completely. The new project puts drugmakers in the seat of venture capital investors or donors in an area where most don’t have active research pipelines. Smaller companies and biotech firms with antibiotic drug candidates in all stages of development will receive financing and technical support from big companies. Several big pharmaceutical companies, including Basel-based Novartis and Allergan, recently stopped novel antibiotic research altogether and two antibiotic start-ups went bankrupt last year. On Thursday, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan said that “finding a new drug for a resistant bacteria has proven incredibly challenging” and that he hoped that the fund would catalyse new innovation. Novartis’ generics division Sandoz remains one of the world’s biggest suppliers of antibiotics but the company has not indicated any plans to get back into novel antibiotic research. Basel-based Roche is one of the few large companies that recently returned to antibiotics R&D and diagnostics after exiting decades ago. According to a reportExternal link by Pew released in April, some 95% of the antibiotic products in development are led by small companies. Nearly 75% of the companies are considered pre-revenue, meaning that they have no products on the market. Swiss start-ups including Bioversys, Polyphor, Basiliea and Actelion are heavily engaged in antibiotics researchExternal link and development, some of which could benefit from the fund. “It’s not a secret that big pharma has pulled out of antibiotics for economic reasons. They feel a sense of responsibility. We need new antibiotics and there is growing concern that remaining SMEs can’t survive,” said Marc Gitzinger, CEO of Bioversys, a biotech start-up based in Basel that is working on an antibiotic to fight highly resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. While Gitzinger is pleased at the fund’s potential for helping companies like his with their research, he believes larger industry reforms are needed in the long term to give companies incentives to make antibiotics.   “This fund is really bridging the gap for SMEs and drug developers, but it will not be the solution. The solution in the end is a valid marketplace,” he said. Cueni explained that selling antibiotics doesn’t offset the research and development costs. “Right now, the worst that can happen to someone who invests in antibiotics is that they succeed because then they will lose more money than if they just have to write off the research expenditures.” While everyone agrees the overall antibiotics model is broken, there is no agreement on how to fix it. Some ideas have been floated such as a Netflix subscription modelExternal link being tested in the United Kingdom that pays companies upfront in exchange for access to antibiotics. But there remain divisions on how to ensure global access while also providing incentives for firms to continue to develop drugs. At Thursday’s launch, Ghebreyesus offered the full assistance of the WHO to ensure access and appropriate use are included in the new fund’s vision. These issues are priorities for Manica Balasegaram, who is the Executive Director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDPExternal link), which is focused on late stage clinical development and ensuring treatments are used responsibly and made accessible in low-income countries. He worries about the ‘valley of death’ that exists after marketing approval, which remains largely underfunded and neglected. Michael Altorfer, who heads the Swiss Biotech Association, argues that governments and global health authorities – in particular the WHO – need to recognise that new antibiotics are valuable and warrant a higher price. “As long as the WHO communicates that antibiotics must be cheap so that people in developing countries also have access, investors will leave the market.”
2020-07-10;James Murdoch set to invest in Art Basel organiser;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/james-murdoch-set-to-invest-in-art-basel-organiser/45894128;An investment firm belonging to James Murdoch, media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s son, is poised to take a 30-44% stake in the Swiss exhibitions company MCH Group. The group organises the Art Basel and Baselworld watch and jewellery fairs, both of which were badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Lupa Systems, an investment company founded by James Murdoch in 2019, has been in negotiations with MCH Group for several months. On Friday, MCH Group reported that Murdoch’s company is keen to become an “anchor shareholder” in the MCH Group and take a 30-44% stake in the Basel-based exhibitions firm. Murdoch will also be given a seat on MCH Group’s board of directors. Lupa Systems has signed a long-term relationship agreement and is fully committed to the strategic direction, MCH Group said in a statementExternal link. The deal still needs to be validated at an extraordinary general meeting on August 3. MCH has moved to “strengthen its capital structure and shareholder base to cope with the consequences of the coronavirus crisis and to be able to embark on the process of future-oriented transformation”, it said. The exhibitions company is boosting capital by CHF105 million ($111.51 million). MCH Group has faced a stormy year after the cancellation of its Baselworld watch and jewellery fair in April, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the exit of several big watchmakers. The group said the 2021 edition would also be temporarily shelved. The Baselworld organisers said they would be taking a decision on possible follow-up formats by the summer and would then provide information on the new concept and scheduling. Last month it was also announced that this year’s edition of Art Basel, the world’s biggest art fair, initially rescheduled until September due to the Covid-19 pandemic, had been cancelled altogether. The next edition of the Basel fair will take place from June 17-20, 2021. A version of the show in Hong Kong was also cancelled this year and is due to be held on March 25-27, 2021. Art Basel Miami Beach, meanwhile, is scheduled to take place from December 3-6. Events of up to 1,000 people have been possible in Switzerland since June 22. A ban on events of more than 1,000 attendees will remain in place until at least the end of August.
2020-07-09;Quarter of new Covid-19 cases are people entering from abroad;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/quarter-of-new-covid-19-cases-are-people-entering-from-abroad/45892566;A quarter of the cases recorded in Thursday were attributed to travel to high risk countries. With 88 new cases recorded on Thursday, the spread of the coronavirus has “slightly stabilised”, said the country’s top health official. Stefan Kuster, head of infectious diseases at the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH), said at a press conference on Thursday that he was glad to see the number of new cases sink again below three figures. Wednesday had seen 129 new positives recorded. However, he added, the reproduction rate – how many other people a sick person infects – still stands at 1.38. The objective remains to lower this below one, Kuster said. The new cases are spread around the country, with the larger cantons recording larger growth, and most transmissions happening in nightclubs and discos, but also at funerals and in workplaces, Kuster said. He also said that a quarter of the new cases were people who had visited “at-risk” countries where the virus is more widespread than in Switzerland. In order to stem the further spread of such cases, Kuster said that more information would be provided for people coming from abroad about the need to self-quarantine upon arrival in Switzerland – but there would be no systematic controls at airports or border crossings. Last week, Switzerland published a list of 29 “high risk” countries, from which travellers need to go into quarantine for 10 days after entering Switzerland. Under Swiss law anyone who breaks the regulations could be liable to a fine of up to CHF10,000 ($10,668).  Some 3,000 people in the country are currently in quarantine. Cantonal authorities, who also conduct contact tracing to track the chain of infections, check in with quarantined people to see if they are following the rules. At the press conference, Linda Nartey, the chief doctor in Canton Bern, said that her staff had faced some “unpleasant experiences” from travellers such as quarantine not being respected, or being insulted during check-ups.
2020-07-09;Robots will help us manage Covid-19, but not in the way we think;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/robots-will-help-us-manage-the-covid-19-crisis-but-not-in-the-way-we-think/45890172; Brad Nelson, a robotics professor in Switzerland, had been planning to install a robotic catheter system in China at one of the world’s largest hospitals when the Covid-19 crisis hit. Soon after, Nelson and his team at the federal technology institute ETH realised that the robotic catheters designed to protect surgeons from harmful x-rays during brain operations had unintended benefits against the novel coronavirus. “We discovered that using remote robotic systems that allow the surgeon to perform procedures outside the operating room could also prevent the transmission of Covid-19”, Nelson told swissinfo.ch. Surgical robots have been around for decades to perform minimally invasive surgeries that can help patients recover faster. Similarly, industrial robots have been assembling cars in factories for years. But amid the pandemic, robots could bring back some sense of normalcy by doing essential tasks that have become too risky for humans, and relieve us from other, much more mundane chores. “It became clear very early on that the reason to have robotics in the first place is exactly because of situations like Covid-19. This has put even more focus on the types of robots and services we can provide”, Peter Fankhauser, CEO of theSwiss start-up ANYbotics, told swissinfo.ch. His company is one of many catering to humanity’s new need for robotic help. The Robotics for Infectious Diseases,External link a new consortium of roboticists addressing Covid-19, found reports of more than 150 waysExternal link robots are being used in Covid-19. In different countries, disinfecting robots with UV lights have been sweeping through hallways in hospitals and schools, four-legged robots have been delivering packages to doorsteps, and robotic dogs have been spotted monitoring social distancing in parks. The pandemic arrived at a time of huge advances in the robotics field with the rise of AI and machine learning. In Switzerland, the field has been booming. Researchers and start-ups like Sensars and MyoSwiss are developing wearable or prosthetic robots. Flying robots like Dronistics can undertake rescue missions. Educational robots are teaching computational thinking and engineering. When the pandemic spread, Dario Floreano, who heads the National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics, and colleagues gathered to think about ways Swiss researchers could contribute to tackling the global scourge. “We could develop a lot of technology solutions, but the last thing people need is to figure out a new technology,” he said. “What we need is to figure out how to apply the ones we have. It wasn’t the time to send experimental prototypes into the field.” Some of these reservations to push robotics too hard stemmed in part from some of the misconceptions about where robots can really make a difference and where they’re mere gimmicky hype. Earlier this year, the Idiap Research Institute in Martigny in Canton Valais showed off a robot that makes raclette cheese at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It grabbed attention, but the intention was never to replace the person who makes the raclette, said Sylvain Calinon, the team leader. “It started as a joke. Living in the Valais, I know that a robot can never replace that special interaction you have with the person who makes your raclette.” But the point was to start a conversation about the technology that is powering the robot in a way that was easy for people to understand. As the cheese melts and is scraped off onto a plate, the robot must adapt to the changing weight and shape of the cheese. The robot is programmed to learn from demonstration whereby a person guides the robot by hand, or the robot observes a person’s gestures, and then imitates them. The technology could be applied to many areas such as getting dressed. The Idiap team has been working on such a use case as part of I-DressExternal link, a project that uses robot assistants to help someone dress, including health care workers, who have to limit physical contact with garments to avoid contamination. “The robot has to adapt to the needs of an elderly person, which are different than a young person who was injured in a sports accident,” Calinon explained during a visit to the research institute. ANYbotics' four-legged walking robots have been used for routine inspections and to solve maintenance problems in industries such as offshore and onshore energy, chemical production and construction sites. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, it has been receiving requests for their four-legged robots to disinfect spaces in public buildings such as schools and hospitals that have stairwells. There, previously harmless tasks carry serious health risks. This makes autonomous robots designed for places too dangerous for humans more reliable, and cost-effective. “Routine inspection in industrial environments continues to be our focus but the sky is the limit in terms of applications,” Fankhauser said. The company is also working on using the robot for delivery services for packages from warehouses to customers’ homes in difficult to reach areas. Demand for such services has been given a boost by the rise in use of teleconference and telepresence during the pandemic. The initial impetus for building teleoperating functionality was to keep surgeons safe and out of warzones. This eventually led to the creation of the Da Vinci surgical system that is used in more than 60 countries. About a decade ago, there was some effort to make telepresence robots that essentially move around, monitoring patients and allowing them to talk to their family. However, the idea hadn’t really taken off until Covid-19 said Nelson. With the pandemic, this changed. In Italy, robots named Tommy have been doing the rounds with nursesExternal link to help take patients’ blood pressure and check oxygen levels. Despite the potential, experts warn that developing robots exclusively for the purpose of tackling the pandemic is the wrong approach. The robotics industry learned this lesson during the Ebola outbreak when the United States government and the US National Science Foundation discussed ways robotics could help stop the transmission. “As the pandemic waned, the ideas became less interesting and didn’t get any traction,” Nelson said. But Covid-19 is different as it has restricted daily activities much more, opening the door for robots. Another challenge is finding investors other than governments. The economic downturn has already complicated financing for robotics start-ups as investors focus on keeping existing companies afloat. This is one of the reasons Calinon’s team is prioritising flexibility both in the back-end programming and its robots’ range of use. “We don’t want to put all of our efforts in one specific application,” he said. “Maybe tomorrow there is another problem, but something completely different.” What is challenging, Calinon said, is that there is an immediate widespread need. “When something is at the stage of a research project, usually it's quite complicated to move it to the terrain in the same week or the same month.” It took 15 or so years for the Roomba vacuum cleaning robots to come on the market. The development timeframes has shortened to five to seven years in many cases, but robots still require lengthy testing and safety inspections before they are ready for use, especially when they have to interact with humans. Robotics perhaps more than many other fields has had to fight back images of robots that are out of control. One malfunction in a hospital or a school could have lasting consequences for people’s acceptance of robots. “For start-ups, accidents can be disastrous from a business perspective,” said Floreano. They are just starting to grow their business so it can be difficult to absorb the blow.” The robotics industry also has to contend with concerns about making some jobs obsolete at a time when unemployment is skyrocketing in many countries, including Switzerland. In a recent op-ed, J. Jesse Ramírez at the University of St Gallen argued that robots have not actually saved us in this pandemic because they can't truly replace essential human labor. The pandemic has underscored how important essential workers are, many of whom have been underpaid and undervalued for a long time, he said. He is suspicious of the idea that our problems afford a technical fix. “I’d like to see the people who do the work leading discussions about if and how their work can or should be automated,” said Ramírez. Robot experts dismiss fears of mass unemployment from robots. Fankhauser said that people often ask him when they would see robots on the streets or delivering food. But he didn’t think that was the way robotics would evolve anytime soon. “I think it's going to be much more that someday you'll have ten robots in the sewage systems in Zurich instead of having people down there,” he said. “They are going to be out of sight a lot of the time.” He admits that there is also more apprehension about robots everyday life in Switzerland than in countries like Japan. He tries to describe robots more like smart tools and to be transparent about what they can and can’t do. Some experiences and interactions in life are irreplaceably human. Using robots might have benefits from an infectious disease standpoint but humans need physical contact. “We need touch. We have that sensitivity to touch and feeling, that tells us how we can expect someone to behave,” Nelson said. “To encode that in a machine is challenging for engineers.” 
2020-07-09;Artist Harald Naegeli receives 2020 Zurich city award ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-artist--harald-naegeli-receives-2020-zurich-city-award-/45891820;The 80-year-old “sprayer of Zurich”, has received this year’s city art prize for the gangly stick-figure graffiti that he has been leaving on walls and buildings for decades. The “exceptional artistic personality” will receive this year’s CHF50,000 ($53,303) prize for his “pioneering” work from the 1970s to today, the Zurich authorities announced on Thursday. Significantly, some of his older work – six figures which he sprayed in Zurich parking lots almost five decades ago – will also be elevated to “artistic” status. Naegeli, though enjoying an international reputation (he also left his mark in Germany), has often been pursued by the law, and he was handed a nine-month prison sentence in 1981 for vandalising buildings. Even now, for his most recent graffiti on a schoolhouse in Zurich, Naegeli has a fine hanging over him. Another of his coronavirus-period figures, a “dance of death” design he painted on wall of the city’s art gallery, was since removed and charges dropped. The Zurich authorities said in their announcement on Thursday however that their attitude towards unauthorised graffiti remains the same as ever – that is, it is officially punishable. As the Keystone-SDA news agency put it, “in short: if your name isn’t Naegeli, then you won’t be getting an art prize from the city, you’ll be getting a fine for vandalism”.
2020-07-09;Swiss army ‘ready’ for second virus wave;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-army--ready--for-second-virus-wave/45891406;The Swiss army says it is ready to tackle a possible second wave of coronavirus cases and has planned accordingly, says spokesman Stefan Hofer. It can provide soldiers to help if called upon to do so by the government, he said on Wednesday, adding that the army will only carry out services that society can’t provide. Specific units or entire battalions are also ready to provide support to the authorities within three or four days. According to the army spokesman, the army has sufficient personnel for a second wave or in an emergency. The army got a historic call-up in March to help tackle the initial wave of coronavirus infections. After nearly three months of a declared “emergency situation” and national semi-confinement, the number of coronavirus cases and deaths dropped sharply and restrictions have been gradually eased. However, the number of cases has recently been creeping up again and the government has responded notably by imposing the wearing of masks on public transport nationwide. Since the cantons have reassumed their traditional decision-making powers, some have taken further steps to contain the spread of the virus, such as compulsory wearing of masks in shops in western cantons Vaud and Jura. On Wednesday, four north-western cantons (two cantons of Basel, Solothurn and Aargau) also stepped up protective measures, following the example of Ticino in the south. They are now limiting the maximum number of guests in restaurants, bars, clubs and events to 100 instead of the previous 300. Only those establishments and events that guarantee a minimum distance of 1.5 metres between people and require their customers to wear masks are exempt from the new limit there.

However, the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic have had a major impact on their fortunes.  The number of high net worth individuals  (HNWIs) in Switzerland - with assets of at least $1 million (CHF936,557) excluding their main residence - jumped by 13.9% to 438,000 in 2019. The size of their assets increased by 14.1%, according to the Capgemini World Wealth Report 2020 published Thursday.  Globally, the number of high net worth individuals increased by 8.8% to 19.6 million people and their fortunes grew by 8.6% to $74 trillion.  Last year, growth was particularly strong in North America, with the number of HNWIs increasing by 10.9% to 6.3 million. This was followed by Europe with an increase of 8.7% to 5.2 million and the Asia-Pacific region with an increase of 7.6% to 6.5 million.  In the hierarchy of the richest, millionaires with assets between $1 million and $5 million represent the bulk of the HNWIs with 17.7 million people worldwide. This is followed by those with assets between $5 and $30 million, who numbered about 1.8 million. At the top of the list are the 183,000 or so ultra-HNWI who hold sums of money in excess of $30 million.  In the first quarter of 2020, the economic impact of Covid-19 resulted in the evaporation of $18 trillion from the markets. Between January and the end of April, global wealth contracted by 6% to 8% over one year. 
2020-07-08;Virus crisis has negative effect on mental health, says survey;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/virus-crisis-has-negative-effect-on-mental-health--says-survey/45890054;The coronavirus crisis has had a negative effect on Switzerland’s mental health, a survey in the German speaking part of the country has confirmed. Out of 9,279 people questioned, 47% said that the crisis had adversely affected their morale, 31% said it had not really had an impact on their mental health, and 22% replied that it had had a positive effect. A majority of women (51%) considered the impact negative, compared with 45% of men. It also found that the younger people were, the more they felt their mental state negatively affected by the crisis. The older they were, the less they felt it had an effect in this way. The survey was conducted by the Sotomo institute for the NGO Health Promotion Switzerland, as part of a mental health campaign that also encourages people to express their feelings. This survey found that people had experienced a greater range of emotions than usual in recent months, although still only a minority felt comfortable talking about them. An analysis of 46 emotions covered by the survey found that love, joy and feelings of internal security were the most frequently mentioned positive emotions, while mistrust and despair were the most frequently felt negative ones. While the survey covered only German-speaking parts of the country, “one may wonder whether the emotions and feelings of people in the French and Italian speaking regions were different”, commented Florence Nater, director of the Coordination for francophone mental health associations. She told Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA that the level of negative emotions and feelings of insecurity may have been greater in those regions, which were hit more strongly by the pandemic.

According to the company, the resulting 70 job cuts will be implemented as far as possible through measures such as early retirements or reductions in working hours.   TUI Switzerland currently employs 468 people. Like other companies in the tourism sector, it has not been spared the effects of coronavirus confinement measures and border closures, which prevented people travelling abroad between mid-March and mid-June.   At the end of June, Swiss tour operator Hotelplan announced it was cutting around 430 jobs, including 170 in Switzerland.  Media reports also said airport ground services and baggage handler Swissport was set to cut more than half of its workforce in Britain because of coronavirus.   
2020-07-08;Provide free masks for the poor, say welfare groups;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/provide-free-masks-for-the-poor--say-welfare-groups/45888532;Charities and welfare organisations in Switzerland have warned that many underprivileged people can’t afford to buy face masks to protect against coronavirus. The national association of welfare groupsExternal link on Wednesday urged local authorities to provide welfare beneficiaries with free hygiene masks. The association, which represents state-run and private services, said the cost of masks was too much of a financial strain on the health budgets of poorer people, amounting to some CHF40 ($42.5) per month. Some of the more than 2,000 municipalities in Switzerland say they are following the recommendation by the welfare association, or they that they are willing to increase the welfare payments. The church charity Caritas says it is handing out free masks to customers in its shops. A report by public radio SRF has found that a single mask might cost up to CHF0.7 in major retail shops. Protective masks have become mandatory in public transport across the country since the beginning of the week, following months of debate over the effectiveness of face coverings to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
2020-07-08;Lisbon's outcasts take centre stage in groundbreaking Swiss film ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/portugal-reboleira-o-fim-do-mundo/45886414;Filmed in the poverty-ridden Reboleira district of Lisbon with a non-professional cast, Basil da Cunha’s second feature O Fim do Mundo is an impressive example of a generational shift in Swiss cinema, an injection of vitality brought by filmmakers with immigrant backgrounds. After a series of delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, it premiered in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. O Fim do Mundo (The World’s End) was the only Swiss production included in last year’s Locarno Film Festival main competition. Its most obvious references are Spike Lee’s Do the right thing (USA, 1989), John Singleton’s Boyz in the Hood (USA 1991), or La Haine (France, 1995): films centred in the lack of perspectives of the youth stranded in the periphery of society, looking for a way out.  Its Swissness is all behind the camera. For the director Basil da Cunha, the film is part of a long-term project he started to devise when he moved to Reboleira in 2009, in between his cinema studies in Geneva, where he finished his first long feature, Até ver a luz (Until I see the light). “I didn’t end up in Reboleira with a plan then, he told swissinfo.ch in Locarno.  I was a cash-strapped student looking for a place to live, and that was the only place I could afford to rent in Lisbon.” It didn’t take him long to integrate into the community. “Reboleira is like a small village, everyone knows everybody else, he recalled.  Thanks to rap music – there are a lot of rappers there – I became friends with the young folks, and familiarised with their problems . These problems are common to all disenfranchised communities all over the world: drugs, teenage pregnancy, gang fights, but in O Fim do Mundo there is another, faceless, threat: the real estate speculators who are little by little dismantling the poor, but vibrant Reboleira community. Da Cunha began writing a story that could be performed by his then adolescent friends, but reality surpassed his initial plans. The main character, Spira, can be hardly distinguished from the real-life Spira (Michael Spencer), who spent eight years of his adolescence in a reformatory because of some petty crime. The final script starts with Spira’s return to Reboleira, a kid who had already lost his innocence. Together with Spira, all the other non-professional actors play their own real selves, and this closeness to the Reboleira human dynamics confer an outstanding dramatic effect. This nucleus roaming around da Cunha had already taken part in other self-produced short films, and the high profile enjoyed by the film in Switzerland and abroad gave da Cunha a renewed impulse to continue working with the Reboleira crew. “Each life there is worth a film, so I could say that I have at least some 40 potential stories to develop”, he said. Da Cunha’s dual nationality, Swiss and Portuguese, is not a source of any identity crisis, on the contrary. He feels at ease in Switzerland and in Portugal, and in both settings, his life has always been marked by a cultural blend. He grew up among immigrants in Morges, in the French-speaking Swiss Canton Vaud. In Reboleira, the majority of the population are or descend from immigrants from the Portuguese former colonies in Africa (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and especially from Cape Verde). They represent a layer of Portuguese society that only recently has begun to appear on the local screens. It was also strongly present in Pedro Costa’s Vitalina Varela, the first Portuguese film to receive the Pardo d’Oro or Golden Leopard, the main prize in Locarno, in 2019. (It was also spoken in a mixture of Portuguese and Cape-Verdean creole) These outcasts of Portuguese society, segregated not only economically but along racial lines, still have a hard time to be accepted as part of the same country, as da Cunha explains in this video interview:
2020-07-08;Countries ‘have to cooperate’, says top Swiss diplomat ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/countries--have-to-cooperate---says-top-swiss-diplomat-/45886204; Valentin Zellweger, head of Switzerland’s mission to the UN in Geneva, is leaving at the end of July to take up a new post as Ambassador to Kenya. After four years in Geneva, how does he see the international stage there? Press briefings organised by Zellweger before sessions of the UN Human Rights Council have always attracted many international as well as Swiss journalists, for he has a knack for outlining the international climate and fault lines around the Council’s agenda. Zellweger spoke to swissinfo.ch as he prepared to leave his Geneva post. swissinfo.ch: How have you found your role as a Swiss diplomat during these four years in Geneva, which have seen significant international turmoil?   Valentin Zellweger: It is in Switzerland’s interests that the world continues to resolve its problems collectively, and the means for dialogue is multilateralism. The values spelled out in the United Nations Charter are also enshrined in the Swiss Federal Constitution and in the objectives of Switzerland’s foreign policy.   For a country like Switzerland — whose prosperity is founded on the respect of common rules and which has an economy strongly dependent on exports — the better our neighbours and the world are, the better Switzerland is.   The major challenges facing the world do not stop at the borders. It’s banal to say it, but countries have to cooperate.   Switzerland therefore has every interest in promoting this multilateral cooperation, which takes place notably in Geneva.   How are relations between the actors of International Geneva, including on the human level?   V.Z.: It is an ensemble of actors that is more and more integrated. They work towards the same objectives. You have, of course, the diplomats and administrative staff of the international organisations, but also the academics (EPFL, University of Geneva, The Graduate Institute) and representatives from the private sector.   This desire to cooperate across different sectors is what distinguishes International Geneva, and the growing habit of talking to each other outside immediate circles. In New York, where I have worked, there is the same diversity of players, but they do not interact like they do in Geneva.  It is one of the factors that will determine the future of International Geneva, because it is the ensemble of players that will resolve the problems we face.   Some criticise the socialising that goes with diplomatic life in Switzerland. But isn’t it essential for fostering integration between the different players of International Geneva?   V.Z.: We worked throughout the coronavirus crisis without the possibility of meeting physically. We only had contacts by telephone or video conference. It was no longer possible to have informal, confidential meetings. It was a serious obstacle to the smooth running of our diplomatic work.   When we are invited to receptions, to informal meetings, it always has a professional aim. I go with a list of questions and contacts, with precise objectives. These meetings are precious for my work, as I have again realised after three months of lockdown.   You are leaving Geneva for Nairobi, to be Swiss Ambassador to Kenya. What motivates you to return to this African capital where you began your diplomatic career?   V.Z.: There have been a lot of changes in the 25 years since I was in Nairobi for the first time. And there have been a lot of changes in our perceptions of Africa. Today we see this continent as a strong, important partner with a lot of potential. The average age in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa is around 20, the lowest average age on any continent.   In Nairobi, there are remarkably interesting developments occurring in the digital arena. Kenya is one of the nations that is very advanced in financial technology. I am going in a spirit of discovering an Africa with which we want to strengthen our ties, create partnerships and resolve an array of problems, such as the management of Covid-19 which has not so far impacted sub-Saharan Africa as it has other regions around the world.   In recent years, younger generations all over the world have mobilised to protest violence against women, environmental destruction or racism. Does the emergence of these issues present an opportunity for the UN?   V.Z.: I don’t think any of this is a revelation for the UN. This shows that the UN concentrates on the issues that are most important for human beings, whether it’s security, economic well-being or human rights. It is a trio of values that the UN has defended since its founding. All the movements that you mention — to which I would add the question of social justice — show that the UN is asking the right questions and defending the right values. In fact, these movements reinforce the actions of the UN.   Have you noticed that these demands expressed in the street have had an impact on debates at the UN in Geneva, in particular at the Human Rights Council?  V.Z.: Take the fight against racism. The Human Rights Council quickly held an urgent debate on the issue and adopted an ad hoc resolution. UN organisations follow not only the pulse of the news, but also know how to react to it, especially during these times of a global pandemic when the issues at stake are even more important.   All the themes that you have raised are at the heart of the debates in the Human Rights Council. It is here in Geneva that one finds the forum where all the States of the world and civil society can discuss and develop the means to make the protection of human beings possible.   When you tackle the issue of climate change and the environment from a human rights perspective, you are putting all human beings at the centre of the debate. It is about evaluating what the implications are for individuals and knowing how they can protect themselves from the effects of environmental change, whether it’s in relation to food security, health, or economic well-being, for example. The discussion develops around how citizens can react and overcome the dangers.   
2020-07-06;Motorway station supplier goes into liquidation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/motorway-station-supplier-goes-into-liquidation/45884422;A company that supplies Swiss motorway service stations and convenience stores has gone into liquidation after failing to find new investors. Some 144 jobs at Lekkerland Switzerland are now at risk of disappearing by the end of the year. The company on Monday said it was concentrating on finding new suppliers for the 2,700 stores that it currently services. It is also making social arrangement for its employees, including trying to find them new positions elsewhere. A spokeswoman told the AWP news agency that an investor had pulled out of a financing deal at the last minute, meaning the company could no longer hope to survive beyond the end of this year. Lekkerland will gradually wind down its supply services in Switzerland in the coming months. There was no mention in the statement on the enterprise’s website of coronavirus playing a role in the demise of the firm. The wholesaler was established in the Netherlands in 1956 and rolled out its services to Germany before expanding to Switzerland in 1998. Lekkerland Switzerland span out of the parent group in 2019 to become an independent company. It supplies a range of stores with food and tobacco plus an array of other products such as electrical and household goods.
2020-07-06;Face masks now compulsory on SWISS flights;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/face-masks-now-compulsory-on-swiss-flights/45883700;Swiss International Air Lines says it is making it compulsory for passengers to wear face masks during flights. The government has ordered face masks to be worn on trains, buses and trams in Switzerland and SWISS has decided to voluntarily follow this precaution on its aircraft. The airline had until now highly recommended wearing masks throughout the duration of flights – passengers had only been obliged to wear them when boarding and disembarking from planes. However, practically all passengers have been wearing masks for the whole flying time so the new directive should have little impact, the airline said. With more than 30,000 coronavirus infections and some 2,000 deaths, Switzerland is taking measures to try to stave off a second wave of the pandemic. Over the last two weeks, numbers of new infections have been rising, causing some concern. From Monday, passengers on all trains, trams, buses, cable cars and boats are obliged to wear face covering masks. Few commuters bothered to wear masks on public transport when the precaution was voluntary. But Swiss Federal Railways said on Monday morning that people were obeying the new rules. Also from Monday, people arriving into Switzerland from “high risk” countries must go into quarantine for ten days. An initial list of 29 countries, including the United States and Russia, was published last week and will be continually updated. Airports have also introduced a range of new measures to make flying safer. These include the distribution of disinfectant handwash dispensers, floor markings and opening extra passport control booths to help social distancing and the installation of plastic screens. 
2020-07-05;Artist, curator and architects win the Swiss Grand Award for Art;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/artist--curator-and-architects-win-the-swiss-grand-award-for-art/45882354;The award worth CHF40,000 ($42,341) went to artist Marc Bauer, architects Barbara Buser and Eric Honegger and curator Koyo Kouoh. Also known as the Grand Prix d'art or the Meret Oppenheim Prize, the honour is awarded to individuals in the fields of art, art education and architecture whose work is particularly topical and relevant to Swiss artistic and architectural production. The laureates were selected in late 2019 by the Federal Art Commission and the decision was announced on Friday by the Federal Office of Culture. Marc Bauer from Geneva, a professor of painting and drawing at the Zurich University of the Arts, has been working for more than two decades with a focus on contemporary history. A graduate of the École supérieure d'art visuel in Geneva and the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam, Bauer has presented his work in numerous national and international exhibitions. He has already received the Swiss Art Prize three times in 2001, 2005 and 2006. “Drawing is not only the primary medium of Marc Bauer, it is also the message. Sketch-like or hatched passages, subtle chiaroscuro, stark black and white contrasts form imagery which appears and hints at history. Imagery which follows the medium’s ambivalence: precision in the formal realization and the circling of the imaginary. This is what makes for the specific quality of the work of Marc Bauer,” said a jury statement released on Friday. Fellow laureates, architectural duo Barbara Buser and Eric Honegger, are known for their pioneering work in the field of sustainability. In the field of building transformation and renovation, they have reimagined the urban structure of entire neighbourhoods. “Modesty and a focus on the essential characterise their interventions which, in an intelligent and innovative manner, put into practise principles of modularity, recycling and restructuring and have thus entered into the zeitgeist,” said the jury. Internationally active curator Koyo Kouoh was born in Cameroon and grew up in Switzerland. She reflects on cultural institutions in emerging countries in her curatorial work. Kouoh was director as the Raw Material Company contemporary art centre in Dakar, which she founded in 2008. Since 2019 she has been director of the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town. “As a curator and critic, as well as a founder of cultural institutions, she has devised new ways of presenting and disseminating art and made a lasting contribution to bringing the art from the African continent into a global context,” said the jury. The Swiss Art Awards exhibition, which normally takes place as part of Art Basel, was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. All the finalists of the Swiss Grand Award for Art and their works will be presented on an online platform. The winners will be honoured together with those of the Swiss Grand Prix for Design at an event this autumn.
2020-07-04;Switzerland retains ‘AAA’ credit rating despite coronavirus impact;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-retains--aaa--credit-rating-despite-coronavirus-impact/45880788;The Alpine nation’s ‘stable outlook’ earned it the highest rating from the Fitch ratings agency. The announcement, made on Friday, praised Switzerland’s “diversified and high value-added economy”. The country also benefited from its traditional strengths such as very large net external creditor position, high current account surpluses, and the global reserve currency status of the Swiss franc.  Fiscal prudence on the part of the government was also an important factor with the low government debt/GDP levels being one of the lowest across Fitch’s AAA economies. However, the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to swing the general government fiscal balance into a deficit of 8.5% of GDP in 2020 from a surplus of 1.2% last year largely due to fiscal stimulus packages.  “While the COVID-19 pandemic is having a substantial impact on the Swiss economy and the sovereign's fiscal position, the solid starting position and institutional framework underpin our view that its policy response will support the economic recovery without eroding its 'AAA' credit fundamentals over the medium-term,” stated Fitch.  However, Switzerland’s large banking sector represents a large liability risk even though it did not affect the rating thanks to “sound credit fundamentals” like strong solvency ratios and high reserve requirements. Fitch forecasts that Switzerland’s GDP will contract by 7% in 2020 and unemployment rate will rise from 2.3% in 2019 to 3.7% in 2020 and 4.3% in 2021. 
2020-07-03;Rise in new corona cases sparks concern;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/rise-in-new-corona-cases-sparks-concern-in-switzerland/45879414;Swiss officials have expressed concern over the slow increase in coronavirus infections in Switzerland over the past few weeks. On Friday there were 134 confirmed cases, the third day in a row cases were over 100. It was “not possible to predict how fast the number of cases would rise again”, declared Patrick Mathys of the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) on Friday. On Wednesday cases rose to 137, more than double the number on Tuesday. On Thursday, 116 cases were recorded. Switzerland, which has lifted many of its lockdown restrictions, has registered a total of over 32,000 positive tests for Covid-19 so far, while 1,965 people have died. But the number of infections has started to again increase since mid-June, triggering concerns about a second wave. The number of people hospitalised for Covid 19 has also risen slightly, FOPH said. Currently, 12 people are on ventilators in intensive care in Swiss hospitals. The international situation also does not look very optimistic added Mathys, who is the head of crisis management and international cooperation at the FOPH. “There are several hotspots around the world where cases are exploding,” he told reporters at a weekly press conference in the capital Bern. He mentioned the United States, Brazil and Russia in particular. The situation in Switzerland’s neighbouring countries was also causing concern. Mathys said two new national measures had been announced in Switzerland from next Monday July 6 to counter the rise in Switzerland: the obligatory wearing of masks in public transport and a ten-day quarantine for people arriving in Switzerland from 29 “at risk” countries, which includes the United States and Brazil. As part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, the federal authorities have handed the responsibility for any additional local measures over to the cantons. “It’s not our aim to reintroduce national blanket measures,” Mathys said, referring to the unprecedented step taken for the lockdown, where powers temporarily moved from the cantons to the federal government (under Switzerland’s federal constitution, it’s normally the cantons in charge of daily business). Cantons must “work with the scalpel and tweezers in the areas where we know that there are problems in terms of transmission”, he added. Some cantons have already announced their own targeted measures. Canton Ticino, which has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic due to its proximity to hard-hit Italy, said on Friday that gatherings of more than 30 people were now forbidden. It set a limit for bars and clubs to 100 people. Currently the limit for nightclubs and pubs is 300 for the whole of Switzerland. But questions have been raised after a “super-spreader” infected several people at a club in Zurich, forcing hundreds into quarantine. There have been several other cases of infections at other clubs as well as at schools in Jura and Vaud. On Friday, cantons Vaud and Jura in French-speaking Switzerland also announced that from next week residents would have to wear masks when they go into local shops and businesses.
2020-07-03;Mandatory face masks should not pose problems, says Swiss train boss;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mandatory-face-masks-should-not-pose-problems--says-swiss-train-boss/45879254;The obligation to wear a mask on trains from next Monday will not dissuade passengers from using the network, says Vincent Ducrot, the new head of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB/CFF). This week the government announced that from July 6 all passengers using Swiss public transport will have to wear face masks. The decision is a response to the rising number of coronavirus infections and demands from cantons for such measures. “We count on our clients being a bit more disciplined. It works in France and Germany so there is no reason for it not to work here in Switzerland,” Ducrot told reporters on July 3. Switzerland, which has lifted many of its restrictions, has registered over 32,000 positive tests for Covid-19 so far, while 1,965 people have died. The number of infections has started to again increase in recent days, triggering concerns about a second wave. The new mask requirement on public transport applies to everyone aged 12 or older. It will be in place in trains, trams, buses, mountain railways, cable cars and boats. The Swiss Federal Railways said conductors will ask anyone not wearing a mask to leave the train and anyone refusing will be fined. Until now, the recommendation was to wear a mask during rush hour on public transport, or when the 1.5 metre social distancing could not be maintained. However, only about 5% of passengers in trains have been wearing masks, even in crowded trains. A recent survey nonetheless showed that 74% of people wanted to make face masks mandatory on public transport. Ducrot told reporters at Friday’s press conference that around 60-70% of rail passengers had returned after the coronavirus lockdown. But he warned that the national network faces a “very serious” financial situation, without detailing the damage caused by the pandemic that resulted in empty trains and cancelations over several months. In a recent Sunday newspaper report, Alliance SwissPass, the national public transport organisation, said it expected a drop in the number of local train and bus passes and individual train and bus tickets this year to result in an overall loss of CHF1.5-1.8 billion ($1.6-1.9 billion) in turnover. To help the railways cope, the government recently extended the loan limit for the operator from CHF200 million to CHF750 million. The proposal is now available for consultation until July 22. Despite the worrying financial situation, Ducrot said there would be no impact on the future prices of train tickets or passes. During the press conference, which marks 100 days since Ducrot took over as head of the federal railways, he also promised improvements to train punctuality and new innovations on the network, such as real-time information on occupancy levels.
2020-07-03;Switzerland misses its emissions targets ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/climate_fewer-cows--more-cars--switzerland-misses-its-emission-targets-/45876054;Switzerland’s emissions have declined over the last 30 years, but not enough to meet the national targets set for 2020. What’s behind the gap?  By 2020, greenhouse gas emissions in Switzerland should be down by 20% from what they were in 1990. That’s the target outlined in the federal CO2 law.  While figures are only available until 2018, the federal environment office expected that, based on current projections, Switzerland will fail to meet its national targets. Not even the temporary slowdown of activity caused by the coronavirus crisis will help.  Since 1990, Switzerland’s emissions have declined by 14%, whereas the population has increased by 27%. The level of emissions varies depending on the economic sector involved, as the chart below indicates. One trend that has emerged over time is that the bulk of emissions no longer come from the building sector, but rather from transportation. Note too the increase in the rate of “synthetic” gases, which includes products used in refrigerators and spray cans, considered alternatives to products that harm the ozone layer.  A closer study shows that there has been a marked reduction of emissions in the building sector. Improved energy efficiency and replacement of old oil-fired heating systems have reduced the emissions from houses and buildings by 34%.  Despite more use of heat pumps and solar heating, the potential to bring down emissions from buildings, especially older buildings, remains considerable.  Among countries in Europe, Switzerland uses oil for heating the most, and at present only 1% of houses are adapting to new energy standards each year. At this rate, it would take another hundred years to convert all the buildings in Switzerland.  Agriculture, which generates a seventh of emissions in Switzerland, has also made reductions since 1990 (-10%). Over the years, there has not only been a decline in the total land area used for agriculture, but also in the numbers of cattle being raised, which contribute to the greenhouse effect by producing methane gas.  The decline in animal herds and in use of mineral fertilisers brought down the emissions from agricultural production by about 8% between 1990 and 2011, according to Hannah Hofer, who is head of energy and environmental affairs for the Swiss Farmers’ Union. At the same time, she told swissinfo.ch that emissions from the agrifood sector have gone up (by 15%). Due to the sheer complexity of biological processes, whether in the digestive system of large animals or in organisms that live in the ground, it is not easy to achieve major reductions in emissions from agriculture, Hofer insists. For farms, climate protection goals may conflict with other goals being pursued by the farmer, such as animal welfare, security of food supply or reduced use of plant health products. According to the farming industry association, major reductions in agriculture are feasible only at the expense of food production. For example, a reduction in the number of cattle would would require a drop in consumption of animal products, says Hofer.  Offsetting the reductions achieved in the building sector, agriculture and manufacturing – where there has been a drop of 14% – is road traffic, where emissions have increased somewhat (+1%).  There are several reasons for this. Most of all, there are more vehicles on the road than there were 30 years ago. There are 4.6 million cars in the country, which is an increase of around 50% compared to 1990.  In contrast with other countries in Europe, Swiss drivers favour bigger and more powerful vehicles. In Switzerland, SUVs now make up about half the number of cars on the road, whereas the European average is about a third.  The increase in the proportion of diesel engines, which emit less CO2 than petrol engines, technological innovations in the auto industry and an increase in the number of electric cars have all played a role in bringing down emissions. However, the failure to meet CO2 standards in new cars, as well as the increase in the number of kilometres being clocked by drivers on roads, have put the emissions reduction target from transport (-10% compared to 1990) out of reach.  Fear of catching the coronavirus on public transport has put many citizens back behind the wheel or on motor scooters, as reported in a study by the Deloitte Switzerland consulting firm published in April. It is likely that there will be an increase in personal motor transport in the near future, which presents challenges for the national climate policy.  Greenhouse gas emissions generated in Switzerland make up no more than 0.1% of emissions worldwide. Switzerland’s effect on the international level is greater, though, when one considers its per capita emissions, which are more than those of developing countries like Brazil and India.  Switzerland may not be top of the class, but it is at least among the countries that have reduced emissions from what they were in 1990.  Researchers say that the next ten years will be decisive for the planet. It is not about looking back with regrets, but focusing on the future, in particular the year 2030. This is when Switzerland intends to halve its total emissions.  Reaching that target, which was part of the Paris Agreement on climate change, requires an amendment of the federal CO2 law, currently being debated by parliament.  According to the federal government, the 2030 targets can still be reached by improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy and compensating for the unavoidable emissions, including with projects abroad. In the longer term, Switzerland among many other countries have set their sights on net zero emissions by 2050. 
2020-07-03;Downwards trend for train accident deaths continues;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/downwards-trend-for-train-accident-deaths-continues-trains/45878518;" There were 17 deaths due to rail accidents last year, a slight drop on 2018. The number of fatalities and accidents has been falling since the 1970s, despite more trains running.  Overall there were 60 rail accidents last year, down by 11 on 2018, the Federal Statistical Office said on Thursday.External link   The 17 people who were killed in 2019 were mostly crossing tracks or were employees of the Swiss Federal Railways who were on the tracks. No passengers were affected. Suicides were not included in the statistics.   The number of deaths was 15 in 2018 and over the past ten years this figure has oscillated between 13-27, the stats office said. There has been a steep fall in the number of accidents, fatalities and serious injuries on the railways in the past 50 years. In 1970 there were almost 620 accidents, with more than 100 deaths and 400 serious injuries; by 2000 this stood at 220 accidents, 29 deaths and 61 serious injuries. The Swiss are heavy railway users. In December 2019 – pre-coronavirus – the average Swiss took the train 71 times a year travelling 2,398 kilometres by rail, according to the European Statistical Office, Eurostat. Measured by distance travelled per capita, Switzerland was found to be a European leader. However, public transport use is currently down in Switzerland due to the coronavirus, although most trains are now running."
2020-07-02;Switzerland publishes list of ‘high risk’ travel quarantine countries;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-publishes-list-of--high-risk--travel-quarantine-countries/45877556;The United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil are among 29 countries listed as posing a high risk of coronavirus infection by the Swiss authorities. From July 6, travellers entering Switzerland from these countries must go into quarantine for ten days. The Federal Office of Public Health published the listExternal link on Thursday as part of new measures taken by the Swiss authorities to prevent a second wave of the pandemic. After flattening the peak in March, infection rates have been creeping up over the past two weeks, sometimes rising to above 100 on certain days. The authorities fear that the rise in infections may in part be explained by people arriving from abroad or Swiss people travelling to high risk countries and bringing the virus back when they return. Serbia and Kosovo are also included on the list because large populations of migrants from these countries have settled in Switzerland and regularly return to visit relatives. The full list,External link in alphabetical order, is: Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Iraq, Israel, Kosovo, Kuwait, Moldova, North Macedonia, Oman, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, Sweden, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States. The list of high risk countries will be continuously updated by the health authorities. Visitors who have spent time in the named countries in the previous 14 days must notify the Swiss authorities immediately on arrival and then go into quarantine for 10 days, the government said. According to Swiss public radio, SRF, under Swiss law anyone who breaks the quarantine regulations could be liable to a heavy fine of up to CHF10,000.  Travellers affected will be notified during the flight, on board coaches and at border crossings. People arriving into Switzerland from these countries are required to report to the cantonal authorities after entry. Airline and coach companies are instructed not to transport sick passengers. Full information about entering Switzerland and quarantine rules can be found hereExternal link (French and German). On March 25 the Swiss government imposed strict entry restrictions at its borders and airports due to the spread of the coronavirus. These are being progressively eased and adapted. After improvement to the coronavirus situation, on June 15, the government allowed travel between Switzerland and all European Schengen states as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union but is in the 26-nation Schengen area which normally has no frontier checks. Unrestricted travel has been allowed between Switzerland and all the other Schengen members, apart from Sweden which appears on the government list. On July 20, travelers from the following countries, deemed as safe , will be able to enter Switzerland: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, Montenegro, New Zealand, South Korea, Rwanda, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. At the same time, EU states not belonging to the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania), whose citizens have been allowed to enter Switzerland since June 15, 2020, will also be removed from the list of countries as risk. China will also be added to the safe list in accordance with EU recommendations, provided that reciprocity is guaranteed to Swiss residents, the government said. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to citizens rather than travellers from safe countries. This has now been corrected. A clarification has also been made regarding Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania.
2020-07-02;Switzerland fast-tracks antiviral medication against Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-fast-tracks-antiviral-medication-against-covid-19/45877424;The Swiss health authorities have granted approval for the remdesivir drug in “record time” for treating coronavirus patients. The temporary authorisation to widen the use of the antiviral drug will be closely monitored in case of adverse side effects. Swissmedic, the agency that oversees the use of medicaments in Switzerland, took days to fast-track approval of the drug, which is produced under the brand name Veklury by US biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. The application for its extended use was only received on Monday. It can now be used for a limited period of time to treat patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia who also require oxygen. The drug has been authorized for emergency use in the United States, India, Singapore, South Korea and Japan and has been recommended by the European Medicines Agency to treat coronavirus patients in the EU. Swissmedic said on Thursday that it had conducted a “careful review in record time” of the drug. Hospital doctors have now been given the green light to administer the treatment. “Adverse reactions to the drug will be closely monitored in order to ensure patient safety,” read a statement. “The product will also be made available to patients outside approved clinical trials and the approved compassionate use programme while the submitted authorisation application is being reviewed,” it added. Clinical trials in the US on medicaments containing the active ingredient remdesivir found that the hospital stay of severely affected Covid-19 patients was shortened in almost a third of cases.
2020-07-02;New cars on Swiss roads failed to meet emissions targets;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-cars-on-swiss-roads-failed-to-meet-emissions-targets/45877066;Fuel consumption and emissions limits for new cars in Switzerland missed their target in 2019 for the fourth year in a row. This resulted in sanctions totalling CHF78 million for car importers. Last year, the 314,000 new cars registered in Switzerland spat out CO2 emissions of about 138.1 grams per kilometre, a rise of 0.2% on 2018, the Federal Office for Energy said on Thursday. This means new cars have overshot their emissions targets of 130g per kilometre every year since goals were set in 2015. As a result, car importers were hit with sanctions of CHF78.1 million ($82.7 million), money paid to the Swiss fund for national roads and traffic (FORTA). The energy office said that the increase last year was due to the growing number of 4x4 vehicles on Swiss roads (over half of all cars bought), a slight increase in the total dry weight of cars, as well as the downturn in the number of diesels on the road. The slight increase in the number of electric or part-electric cars (from 3.2% to 5.6%) wasn’t enough to significantly lower the emissions stats. According to the Swiss Transport and Environment Association, the sanctions are too light. They represent around CHF250 for every new car sold – a figure too low to be even registered by a buyer shelling out an average of CHF43,000, the association said on Thursday. It also opposed calls by importers to waive the sanctions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which dealers claim has hindered moves towards climate-friendliness. “Various highly effective [from an environmental point of view] car models will now only come on the market later,” said Christoph Wolnik of the Swiss Auto association. He also said that “massive subventions” for low-emissions vehicles in countries like France and Germany means that carmakers will be more incentivised to do business there, rather than to in Swiss market. For 2020, meanwhile, the maximum emissions targets have dropped even lower, at 95g per kilometre.
2020-07-02;Senior Swiss medical official recommends wider mask obligation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/senior-swiss-medical-official-recommends-wider-mask-obligation/45875654;Masks should be worn not only in public transport, but in all public spaces, the president of the Swiss cantonal doctors association said on Thursday. “From an epidemiological perspective, widening the obligation to the entire public space would be possible, and we would welcome it,” Rudolf Hauri told Swiss public broadcaster SRF. On Wednesday, the government announced that a general obligation to wear protective masks on public transport would enter into force next week. Beyond public transport, a recommendation is still in place to wear a mask when the minimum social distancing of 1.5 metres can’t be maintained – but there is no rule in place. Also on Wednesday, the Covid-19 task force – a scientific group advising the government on the pandemic – recommended that the authorities take more measures. Up to now the wearing of masks has not been widespread in Switzerland, while the government has been reluctant to enforce this on the population. It could be made mandatory in settings “where distancing cannot be ensured and the presence of individuals is not entirely a matter of choice for them”, the task force wrote. As well as public transport, they mentioned medical institutions and food stores. Not taking such measures, the task force said, “is, we believe, likely to contribute to the emergence of a second intense wave of Covid-19 in Switzerland”. The number of daily new coronavirus cases climbed above three figures to 137 on Wednesday. Since mid-June, the task force said, the reproductive rate for Covid-19 has been well above 1: meaning that every person infected then spreads the virus to more than one other. Commenting on these figures on Thursday, Hauri said that cantons are still able to manually carry out contact tracing for each new case reported, although it is a “big challenge”. An SRF survey of cantonal doctors found they could still manually trace the chain of infections even if new numbers were to climb above 200.
2020-07-01;Swiss government extends coronavirus economic support;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-government-extends-coronavirus-economic-support/45874472;The government is extending short-term unemployment benefits by another six months and plans to help cushion financial losses faced by public transport. On Wednesday, the government announced that it is extending the maximum period for receiving partial unemployment support from 12 to 18 months to counteract a rise in unemployment. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said this was important to “stabilise the situation”. Since April, over 190,000 companies have applied for short-time compensation for nearly two million employees - around 36% of the workforce in Switzerland. The government also submitted a proposal on Wednesday to provide rent relief on commercial properties that had to close as a result of the pandemic. Under the billExternal link, tenants will only be expected to pay 40%, with landlords absorbing the remaining rent. Landlords that suffer hardship as a result will be able to apply for financial compensation from the government. Parmelin indicated that additional stabilisation measures are being considered, for example for the travel industry. In a reportExternal link released on Wednesday, the United Nations estimated that the pandemic could cost Swiss tourism as much as over CHF31 billion or around 5% of GDP, if restrictions stay in place for one year. The government also proposed earmarking CHF800 million to help public transport and rail freight. In a statement, the government wrote that the industry is unable to compensate for all of the financial losses as a result of coronavirus restrictions. Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency, underscored the importance of public transport in Switzerland: “They are central to our country,” she said. The government also extended the loan limit for the Swiss national railway operator from CHF200 million to CHF750 million.The proposal is now available for consultation until July 22. Finance Minister Ueli Maurer announced on Wednesday that he expects a budget deficit of at least CHF1 billion next year as the government shells out money to prop up businesses affected by the pandemic. Without the virus, the 2021 budget was expected to have a surplus of CHF2.2 billion. It is estimated that coronavirus debt will eventually reach CHF20-35 billion. The government doesn’t plan to submit the 2021 budget until September and will not decide how to pay back the debt until later this year. He doesn’t anticipate this will require raising taxes. Maurer expressed confidence in an economic recovery and the country’s market attractiveness. “We will come out of this with a black eye,” he told the press. 
2020-07-01;Switzerland re-opens its European borders;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_what-s-happening-at-swiss-borders-and-airports-/45727184;"On June 15 Switzerland re-opened its borders with many other European states after improvements to the coronavirus situation. Since midnight on June 14, the Swiss governmentExternal link has allowed travel between Switzerland and all Schengen statesExternal link and the United Kingdom. The Schengen area operates control-free crossings, but they have been mostly closed for three months to all but goods traffic and critical workers due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, all passengers on direct flights from Sweden to Switzerland are being tested for possible fever on entry into the Alpine nation. Travellers from Sweden are the only ones affected by this measure for now. Until recently, Switzerland has said it is not yet possible to allow travel from outside the Schengen zone. For example, a visitor from the US will not be able to enter Switzerland. However, on July 1 it announced that on July 20, travelers from the following countries, deemed as safe , will be able to enter Switzerland: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, Montenegro, New Zealand, South Korea, Rwanda, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. At the same time, EU states not belonging to the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania), whose citizens have been allowed to enter Switzerland since June 15, 2020, will also be removed from the list of countries at risk. China will also be added to the safe list in accordance with EU recommendations, provided that reciprocity is guaranteed to Swiss residents, the government saidExternal link. From July 6, anyone entering Switzerland from 29 at risk countries must be quarantined for 10 days. The public health office will regularly update its list of the risky regions. Full information about entering Switzerland and quarantine rules can be found hereExternal link (French and German). Previously, some border easing had already taken place. Austria decided to open its border with Switzerland on June 4. And in an earlier move, on May 15, the borders between Switzerland, Germany and Austria opened again just for unmarried couples, and for those wishing to visit relatives or attend important family events.  Previously only couples who were married, in registered partnerships or who had children together were allowed to travel to see each other under restrictions imposed in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.   Since May 11, Swiss authorities have also been processing the backlog of applications made by non-Swiss citizens to work or rejoin family in Switzerland. From this date, business executives could also enter Switzerland for very important business meetings or the signing of contracts that cannot be re-scheduled.  Switzerland’s frontiers were closed and strictly controlled from March 13, when the government limited land border crossings from Italy to curb the spread of the virus. Restrictions on entryExternal link by land and by air were later extended to all Schengen and non-Schengen states. Strict entry restrictions were imposed: only Swiss citizens, Swiss resident permit-holders, those entering the country for professional reasons (e.g., those who work here and have a permit to prove it), essential health workers, those transiting through or “in a situation of absolute necessity”,  were able to enter the country.External link The restrictions hit cross-border traffic, which  fell by 70% compared to pre-crisis levels. Vehicles had to be channelled through the largest customs postsExternal link for checks, as many of the major border crossing points across Switzerland were closed. Switzerland’s main airports – Zurich, Geneva and Basel-Mulhouse – now hope to slowly ramp up their operations after being at a standstill for several months. Zurich Airport said on May 28External link that airlines such as Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Edelweiss Air plan to restore a substantial part of their services in the next few weeks to offer over 350 flights from Zurich and Geneva to some 70 European destinations.  EasyJet aircraft will take to the skies on Monday for the first time since March 30. The company plans flights between Geneva and Lisbon, Porto, Nice, Bordeaux, Nantes and Brindisi. Over the past three months airplanes have stood idle. In April and May, there were roughly eight flight movements (departures and arrivals) a day in Geneva. Meanwhile, Zurich Airport traffic was reduced to around 25 flight movements a day in April; on Monday there are planned to be around 50. Basel-Mulhouse airport’s activities fell by 99.8% over April and May. It expects all its normal European destinations to be available by the end of the year. The airport forecasts 1.8 million passengers to use the airport in 2020, compared to 9.1 million in 2019. The re-opening of borders follows agreement between European interior ministers for a coordinated step-by-step lifting of travel restrictions between Schengen states while reaffirming the priority of protecting citizens against the virus.  “Initially, the progressive re-opening of Europe’s internal frontiers must take place. Only after that will a step-by-step re-opening of the Schengen external borders be possible to allow the entry of people from third states,” the Swiss justice ministry said in a statementExternal link.   Andreas Wittmer, head of the Center for Aviation Competence at the University of St. Gallen, predicts European air traffic to slowly pick up in the second half of the year. By contrast, it is likely to be 2021 before the long-haul networks are up and running again, and it will then take several months to years before the entire network is reactivated, depending on how demand recovers and develops, he told the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper."
2020-07-01;Masks declared obligatory on Swiss public transport ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/masks-declared-obligatory-on-swiss-public-transport-/45873920;From Monday passengers on Swiss public transport will have to wear face masks, the government has announced. It will also impose a quarantine requirement for individuals entering the country from regions at high risk of Covid-19. The decision is a response to the rising number of coronavirus infections and demands from cantons. “Following the lifting of measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, more people are using public transport,” the government said in a statement on Wednesday. “In many cases the recommended distance cannot be maintained.” The mask requirement applies to everyone aged 12 or older. It applies in trains, trams and buses, mountain railways, cable cars and on ships. The Swiss Federal Railways said conductors will ask anyone not wearing a mask to leave the train and anyone refusing will be fined. Until now, the recommendation was to wear a mask during rush hour on public transport. However, the government admitted that few people have been doing so. “We want to prevent a second wave,” said Interior Minister Alain Berset at a press conference. He said Switzerland had so far been out of step with its neighbours in not imposing such a requirement.  Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, said: “We’ve seen in recent days how quickly the virus can spread again.” Some public transport operators expressed relief over the government's decision on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Bern regional transport company BLS told Swiss public television, SRF, that it welcomes  the uniform decision, since the BLS runs its trains through seven different cantons .  The public transport employee union was also pleased with the decision but said it was problematic that train and bus conductors and staff were responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirement. On Wednesday 137 new cases of Covid-19 were reported to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), compared with 62 on Tuesday and 35 on Monday. Also from Monday, anyone entering Switzerland from risk areas will have to undergo a ten-day quarantine. The FOPH keeps a corresponding list, which is updated regularly. Those concerned must report to the cantonal authorities after entry. Airline and coach companies are also instructed not to transport sick passengers. The public health office is in the process of finalising its list of the risk areas. In a statementExternal link, the government acknowledged the European Union recommendations on lifting entry restrictions for 15 specific countries starting July 1. It added that Switzerland is expected to follow these recommendations, but from July 20 and with the exception of Serbia. 
2020-07-01;Coronavirus: A turning point for telehealth in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus--a-turning-point-for-telehealth-in-switzerland/45870678;The Covid-19 pandemic has given a new impetus to telehealth, with lockdown leading to an increase in remote medical consultations. Patients are now returning to doctors’ practices, but the digitisation of health has become standard – even if not all are persuaded of the benefits. Booking a doctor’s appointment or receiving test results online has been commonplace for years. Remote medical consultations, however, were still a peripheral phenomenon. Patients and doctors were sceptical: How do we build a rapport? How do we guarantee the privacy of data? How do we reach the right diagnosis? So many questions that remained unanswered for a long time… In March the coronavirus crisis changed all of this. Given the risks, remote consultations became the de facto norm for doctors, says Arthur Germain, the director and founder of the website OneDoc, which specialises in arranging doctors’ appointments online. “We have wanted to develop a video consultation tool for a long time, but we always got the impression doctors weren’t ready for it, so we shelved the project,” Germain says. “Covid-19 was a massive impetus however: our developers worked hard for a week to build a coded video platform.” With the virus, demand exploded. “Within two months, it increased tenfold,” Germain says. He has registered almost 2,000 specialists on his website, 500 of them for this new service. Until the end of the pandemic, the service is free for all those in the medical professions who register. The Geneva start-up hopes to convince doctors of its method, and aims to be more efficient than the telephone and more secure than other video services such as Facetime, Skype or Zoom. “If the quality is good, then video is a real bonus,” says Eric Bec, a general practitioner and head of the Teomera health centre. “At the beginning of the crisis, I had patients on the telephone, but it was complicated to give a diagnosis without seeing them. So I used Whatsapp at first, then OneDoc, to decide who could stay at home and who needed to come to the centre for a consultation.” Other doctors are more negative about their experiences with remote consultations. “We had to fall back on them when necessary,” says Mouncef Berrada, the leader of the medical and surgical centre in Cornavin. “But we won’t introduce them permanently. You can’t solely rely on what a patient says without examining him physically. A video is not enough.” At the Geneva University clinic, Sanae Mazouri, a doctor, didn’t wait for the coronavirus to clear the path for telehealth. She had already launched the project HUG@home in May 2019: a platform with a chat, audio- or video-calling system connecting the doctors at the hospital with caregivers at the Spitex nursing home. “Our goal was to encourage patients to stay home to regulate the flow of emergency cases, and to save time and reduce the costs of transfers back to the hospital,” says Mazouri. “We tested our application for six months with patients who had been discharged from the university hospital and were being cared for at the Spitex. The experiment was conclusive – in nine out of ten cases, we could avoid a transfer back to the hospital.” Given the encouraging results, she had the idea of extending the service from 2021 to patients undergoing treatment for chronic illnesses. And she added a remote consulting service that is directly accessible for all patients after triage to assess their care needs. The pandemic accelerated the process… “In order to react to the health emergency and avoid overwhelming the hospital, we spent two days working to offer all the doctors in the city a new version of our application which was renamed Docteur@home,” Mazouri says. Since then, the service has gained more than 900 professional users at the university hospital and almost 400 doctors in the canton of Geneva. The Fribourg hospital is also laying emphasis on telehealth. In April, medical director Ronald Vonlanthen presented a project supported by the canton: a suitcase with medical equipment to allow the remote treatment of patients. “Coronavirus revealed two big risks to our health system: the risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed and the isolation of patients who are deemed at-risk. With our suitcase, we bring the medical treatment they need to them at home,” says Vonlanthen. “We give the patients treatment in advance to limit the number of transfers to the hospital resulting from complications.” During the crisis, trainee nurses were deployed as mediators to support patients during the remote consultation. But this ambitious project costs CHF50,000 and Vonlanthen is still looking for investors to develop it for the long term. The digitisation of health is not met with enthusiasm everywhere by medical staff. Most practising doctors have taken up physical consultations in their practices again. “Telehealth can give you an idea of the patient’s symptoms,” says Gilbert Geinoz, a GP in Geneva. “But face-to-face health is in my view a better way to reach a diagnosis and above all, appropriate treatment.” Many doctors, nursing staff and therapists even worry about their professional future and complain about “over-digitisation” in health. “This is not my idea of medicine,” Berrada says. They all emphasise the importance of human contact between doctors and patients. This is particularly important in the area of mental health, where telehealth has made some inroads in recent years, especially in the United States. “Analysing the non-verbal body language is a matter of fundamental importance in our profession,” says Pierre-André Mayor, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist in Geneva. “Remote consulting has allowed me to maintain a therapeutic connection to my patients during the crisis, but in my view it worked primarily because I had already built a rapport with them.” It’s too early to say if the coronavirus has delivered a death blow for traditional medicine. According to Arthur Germain, however, the health professions will inevitably develop further towards digitisation. “Medical staff will have to adapt in order to meet patients’ new expectations,” he says. Ronald Vonlanthen remains optimistic about the human contact inherent to medicine. “New technologies and artificial intelligence will change the way medicine is practised and new medical careers will open up. But in order to make a diagnosis, we will always need a human brain behind the machines,” he says.
2020-06-30;Three quarters of Swiss want face masks and more distance;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/three-quarters-of-swiss-want-face-masks-and-more-distance/45871274;A survey has found that the majority of Swiss residents want tougher measures against Covid-19. Many of those questioned said that the relaxing of anti-coronavirus measures had gone too far. For example, most said that people should still keep two metres apart, even though the government recently reduced the distance to 1.5 metres. Throughout Switzerland and across all ages, 74.2% of survey participants said two metres was still “rather to very necessary” in the current situation. Another 73.8% percent wanted to make face masks mandatory on public transport even though a clear generation gap exists on the subject. The approval rate among those over 60 years of age was 82.5%. Among those under 30, it was 68.2%. Regarding the ban on demonstrations with more than 300 participants, 76.6% said it was rather to very necessary to maintain the ban. Published on Tuesday, the representative survey was carried out by market research institute MarketAgent Switzerland on behalf of comparis.ch in June. It included 1,000 people and covered all regions of Switzerland.

Between March 16 and June 14 – when border restrictions were in place – cross-border traffic dropped by 80%. As soon as the restrictions were lifted on June 15, movement across the border rebounded sharply with current levels – to just 10% less than the pre-coronavirus crisis period.   While 112,049 people were prevented from entering Switzerland during lockdown, exceptions were made for 16,854 for whom entry was an absolute necessity. Customs agents fined 8,848 people for non-essential excursions; most of these involved attempts to go shopping over the border.   During the border tightening period, crime dropped by over 40% compared to the same period last year (15,400 violations related to migration, narcotics and arms compared to 27,125 in 2019). The lifting of border controls and the resumption of traffic has led to a significant increase in criminal cases in all areas, according to the FCA. "
2020-06-30;How Switzerland’s ABB plans to shake off ugly duckling image;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-switzerland-s-abb-plans-to-shake-off-ugly-duckling-image/45870618;The first job Björn Rosengren ever applied for was an internship at manufacturer Asea. He did not even get an interview. Now, at 61, he has been appointed to run the sprawling multinational it grew into: ABB. For more than a decade, the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate, which created the first industrial robot in 1974, has been an ugly duckling among the top tier of high-tech industrial engineering companies. ABB is a paradox: a business that is dominantly positioned in some of the highest growth — and sexiest — high-tech engineering markets, and yet has a share price that has only inched upwards while those of competitors have soared. It is the market leader in making and selling industrial robots in China, yet it is also a company for which earnings per share have decreased by an average of 6 per cent annually every year since 2009.  “Many competitors have doubled their share price in the last 10 years,” said ABB’s new chief executive Mr Rosengren, in an interview with the Financial Times — his first since his management team unveiled its new strategic plan for the company this month. “This is a big question mark for me: how can a company with such good technology, such good products, be underperforming for so long?” Mr Rosengren was appointed with a brief for radical change after years of shareholder disquiet. It adds to the size of the challenge facing him that his tenure started on February 1, as coronavirus began to shut down the global economy. Global manufacturing PMI, a good proxy for the health of ABB’s customers, is at 42.4, according to data from IHS Markit — its fourth consecutive month indicating a contraction. The Swede, a veteran of the engineering industry, is undeterred. “When I look at the group, and the areas we are operating in, I would say that any company in the world would envy ABB for being positioned so well when it comes to taking advantage of [long-term] global trends which are taking place,” he said, citing themes such as automation, electrification and sustainability in which ABB excels. He pointed to ABB’s three factories in Bergamo, the north Italian town that has been one of the single hardest-hit localities worldwide by the virus: “They have been at full speed during the whole crisis . . . Our factories are showcases,” he said. “The business opportunity is enormous.”  The substance of Mr Rosengren’s vision for ABB’s future, however, is about whipping the company into financial shape, rather than chasing visions of a technologically gleaming, and high growth, future. Past chief executives have lent hard on such promises — and failed to deliver. “Delivering financial focus is priority number one,” he said. To do so, he can draw comfort from the support of the company’s two biggest shareholders over his new strategy, not least because they devised it, to radically decentralise the group and look at spinning out some of the businesses in its sprawling empire. Johan Forssell, chief executive of Investor AB, the investment vehicle of the Wallenberg family, which owns 12.1 per cent of the company, told the FT he was “fully supportive of ABB’s new strategic direction”. Europe’s largest activist investor, Cevian Capital, which owns 5.9 per cent of the company, has meanwhile been pushing for changes since it bought into ABB in 2015, an investment it is yet to make a return on. Cevian is understood to be closely involved in discussing with Mr Rosengren which divisions ABB should put on the market. The investment group has already scored a victory in a decision taken by ABB two years ago to hive off its giant power grids business, an $11bn sale to Hitachi, which will close at the end of this month.  “Continued portfolio optimisation is vital,” Cevian co-founder Christer Gardell told the FT. Mr Rosengren, he said, was “one of the best industrial CEOs in Europe” and will rationalise ABB in a “fact-based and unemotional manner”. The question is whether, as some analysts fear, such radical plans to refocus the business deprioritise growth for ABB at precisely the moment, in a post-Covid world, when the opportunities offered in areas such as automation and electrification are greatest. “If I were the CEO of Siemens or Schneider Electric I would have opened a bottle of champagne,” said Andreas Willi, a veteran analyst of the capital goods industry at JPMorgan. “ABB is effectively saying it is not going to fight them in these growth areas for now but focus on financial performance. “But by the time you have put your house in order,” he added, “it might be too late to compete.”  Mr Rosengren’s decentralisation plan is certainly radical, covering everything from marine technologies to datacentre power systems.

2020-06-30;Swiss army ends coronavirus deployment;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-army-ends-coronavirus-deployment/45870134;The military has officially ended its involvement in relief measures associated with the coronavirus pandemic after 107 days on duty.   On Tuesday, the last 50 military personnel still serving in the CORONA 20 taskforce – which supports border control and customs operations – will be released from their duties. This marks the official end of the support of the Swiss Armed Forces, ordered by the governing Federal Council on March 16.   Approximately 6,000 military personnel were temporarily deployed across the country and carried out more than 300 missions at the request of the cantons. These included military health workers, as well as regular army soldiers who assisted cantonal police forces and border guards. In total, those deployed completed some 320,000 days of service.   In addition to the army, around 24,000 men and women from the civil defence force participated in the pandemic response. They assisted medical and nursing staff in hospitals and took on tasks including triage, cleaning and disinfection work, and the provision of protective equipment.   They also set up emergency hospitals, consultation centres and telephone hotlines for the population, and provided transportation for people and equipment.  The civil defence force was especially active in densely populated cantons that were seriously affected by the coronavirus, namely the canton of Vaud (about 70,000 service days), Geneva (40,000), Zurich (32,000) and Ticino (12,000). In April, at the height of the mission, some 5,000 civil defence personnel were deployed each week. 
2020-06-29;Resisting Covid-19 ‘fake news’ with a high dose of public trust;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/resisting-covid-19--fake-news--with-a-high-dose-of-public-trust/45859742;"Misinformation about Covid-19, like the pandemic itself, has gone global. And like the virus, it has affected some countries more than others. Where does Switzerland, which has seen alternative media and conspiracy theorists gain in popularity, sit on the “infodemic” spectrum? Is the novel coronavirus a bioweapon created in a Chinese lab or something Microsoft founder Bill Gates created in order to profit from an eventual vaccine? Or did the virus even exist in the first place? One leader of anti-lockdown protestsExternal link in Switzerland doubts it did. In recent months the voices of Swiss conspiracy theorists and alternative media have been amplified, as they exploit both the crisis and social media platforms to spread rumours and reach a bigger audience. It’s all part of an “infodemic”, a term used by the World Health Organization (WHO) during the global coronavirus outbreak to describe “an over-abundance of information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources”. Unverified claims about the origins of the virus, symptoms and potential cures have had fact-checkers and public health authorities on alert, regularly debunking them. Yet new research suggests that misinformation on Covid-19 in Switzerland, though present, is not as widespread as it is in countries where polarisation, low levels of trust in public institutions, and the weaponisation of science are leading people to click “share” on unverified claims. In a sign of just how widespread Covid-19 misinformation is, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that more than a quarter of the most popular YouTube videos on the coronavirus contained misleading information. Videos by conspiracy theorists in French-speaking Switzerland, including a fashion heiress in Geneva urging her followers to reject protective face masks, have gained hundreds of thousands of views altogether, according to Le Temps newspaperExternal link. But a single video by a consultantExternal link “living in the Swiss mountains”, claiming a second Covid infection would be lethal, reached nearly two million views. “There’s been a lot of uncertainty [about the virus] among authorities and researchers, and so that creates uncertainty among the population,” said Edda Humprecht, a senior research and teaching associate in communication at the University of Zurich. People were prone to share rumours, especially in the early days of the outbreak. The theory that Bill Gates was involved in the origins of the virus convinced 8% of Swiss respondents to a Tamedia pollExternal link. A whopping 30% believed the virus was created in a lab. Information overload could be seen across social media. The Covid-19 Infodemics Observatory, which has collected millions of tweets worldwide in the last six months, shows a sharp increase in Twitter chatter about Covid-19 in Switzerland early in the outbreak. From 1,770 Covid-related tweets on February 20, activity jumped to 8,600 tweets on the 25th – the day the first confirmed case of the disease in the Alpine nation was announced –and to 10,000 by early March. Twitter activity remained relatively strong throughout the lockdown, never dipping below 6,000 posts per day. Many of these tweets – about 40% on some days – came from unverified bots, or automated agents with no “verified” status on Twitter. “On average, unverified bots are responsible for sharing and circulating, [and] I would say even 'amplifying', unreliable news,” said Manlio DeDomenico, who runs the observatory at the Complex Multilayer Networks Lab of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy.   Although disinformation on the virus had spread worldwide, some countries were more affected than others, De Domenico and his team concluded in a report published in March. Exposure to unverified bots and unreliable news (such as fake news sites or clickbait) was lower in Switzerland than in Italy, Germany and the US, for example. “You can have thousands of accounts with just one follower, sending only one unreliable message, and [therefore] have a low ‘infodemic risk’,” he explained. In other words, even if thousands of bots are posting false information, few people may actually be seeing it or engaging with it. Humprecht found that people in Switzerland were more reluctant than others to share misinformation. According to a six-country survey she and colleagues at the University of Zurich and the University of Antwerp carried out, the Swiss were the least likely to share false information about Covid-19 on social media (11%); people in the United States were most likely to do so (27%). The researchers explain that this “resilience to fake news” may come down to several factors. One is the availability of reliable news sources. The Swiss trust news outlets at a higher rate (44%) than the global average (38%), the latest Reuters Digital News Report shows. During the lockdown, many turned to mainstream media and the federal authorities for information, driving up online traffic for these sites. Although the media in Switzerland are sometimes criticised by politicians, they have not been systematically de-legitimised or branded as “fake news”, political tactics that can drive trust in news further down, Humprecht pointed out. “When you don’t have trusted sources, there’s a lot of emotionalised content that gets shared,” she said. Simple black-and-white narratives with someone – such as the government – to blame for a problem are typical of the stories created by alternative media. Users share them to signal how they feel; whether they are accurate is of little importance. Her research also revealed that consumers of alternative media are more willing to spread misinformation. But although these sites have become more visible during the pandemic and grown their audience, overall, they remain “a niche phenomenon” in Switzerland, she said. Active social media users too are more likely to engage with false or misleading information, according to Humprecht and her colleagues. Research by a Canadian team, for example, found that people who spend time on social media, where misinformation circulates, tend to have more misperceptions about Covid-19. In Switzerland, 44% of people say they get their news from social media, according to the Reuters report, below the global average of 55%. But their awareness of misinformation is also high: over 70% of those surveyed by the Zurich-Antwerp researchers said they were worried about inaccurate information on the virus circulating online. In some countries, people use social media more as an entertainment than a news platform, where “you’re browsing and come across news and it’s easy to click ‘share’ because of an emotional response,” said Humprecht. This behaviour is more prevalent in the US than in Switzerland, she added. Polarisation, which is comparatively low in the Alpine country, also plays a role in the public’s resilience to disinformation. In highly polarised societies, people mainly trust their preferred news outlets, which can offer “deviating representations of reality” and make it difficult for consumers to tell accurate information from falsehoods or distortions, according to Humprecht. In such an environment, science can become weaponised. Politicians may question the authority of medical experts, for example, and during a pandemic this can encourage people to seek out alternative explanations or cures. The Swiss, on the other hand, have a high degree of trust in science, according to surveys, and largely approved the crisis-management efforts of the government, which early in the outbreak struck up a scientific task force to coordinate advice and research on Covid-19.

2020-06-28;Migration office plans job cuts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/migration-office-plans-job-cuts/45866388;As the number of asylum seekers dwindles, so does the need for staff at Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). “In view of the persistently low number of new asylum applications, the Federal Council has decided not to allocate the financial resources to extend 45 temporary posts in the SEM,” a spokeswoman for the Federal Department of Justice and Police confirmed to the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper. SEM has 1,100 employees, about half of whom work in the asylum department. The cuts represent about 8% percent of that department’s team. Employment contracts due to expire at the end of 2020 will not be extended. This summer, SEM will inform its temporary employees whether or not their contracts will be terminated. In 2015, some 40,000 people applied for asylum in Switzerland – as many people as work for the federal government. In 2019, there were 14,000 asylum seekers. The reason is tighter European border controls. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has reduced the flow of migrants everywhere. 
2020-06-26;EU regulation hampers cross-border workers’ home office ambitions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eu-regulation-hampers-cross-border-workers--home-office-ambitions/45863576;The coronavirus pandemic has instigated a work-from-home culture with many employees wanting to extend the experience. However, as lockdowns ease cross-border workers at Swiss firms may be hamstringed by the return of a strict European Union regulation. The pandemic has caused many people to rethink their so-called home office situation. According to a survey in May, half of the Swiss labour force worked from home during the lockdown. Many Swiss companies and staff would like to continue or extend the work-from-home experience. In the future it will be up to employers to decide and put the necessary safety measures in place. However, the conditions imposed by the EU risk acting as a brake for cross-border workers in regions like Geneva, which borders with France, Swiss public radio (RTS) reports. The reason is that beyond a certain threshold, different tax and social security rules apply if an employee is domiciled abroad. This has an impact on the estimated 330,000 cross-border workers employed at Swiss-based firms but who live in France, Italy, Germany or Austria. The EU regulation in question was suspended during the coronavirus crisis, but observers say this is likely to be short-lived. “For now, companies and employees are subject to an emergency regime. But as soon as this regime is over, we will return to the rules that are applicable in this area,” Olivia Guyot-Unger, director of the legal service at the Federation of Businesses in French-speaking Switzerland (FER), told RTS on June 22. “That means that anyone who works 25% or more of their hours at home in a country other than Switzerland will be subject to that regime and the social security system of their country of residence.” Geneva, which employs some 87,000 cross-border workers from France, is especially affected. “Depending on the profession, teleworking is not possible. But for other professions that we have, you could imagine two or even three days a week working from home,” said Claude Devillard, boss of Geneva-based Devillard SA, which provides documentation and printing services. “But we won't be able to do that with cross-border workers: it's not possible, because social security charges in France are three or four times higher than in Switzerland.” These additional staff costs are simply inconceivable for companies that have taken a huge economic hit due to the pandemic. “This European regulation is not a new problem,” explained FER Director General Blaise Matthey. “Fortunately this regulation was suspended… the situation is being monitored on a day-to-day basis, and there is still a lot of uncertainty as to how long the suspension will last.” As the pandemic has affected neighbouring countries in Europe, “there is a chance that Europeans will realise that their regulation is not adapted to the reality of teleworking”, said Matthey. “Hopefully we can manage to soften the measure in place, but I’m not sure to what extent,” he added.
2020-06-26;Swiss army chief wants more women in military;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-army-chief-wants-more-women-in-military/45862658; Switzerland’s head of the army Thomas Süssli has said that he wants to increase the number of women in military roles from the present 0.8% to 10% by 2030. The army already does a lot to integrate women but does not have an overall strategy. This is currently being drawn up, he said in an interview with Tamedia newspapers on FridayExternal link. But it would be wrong to see women as the solution to the current worrying lack of army recruits, he added. “In our experience, women in the military are especially motivated and involved. They often bring in fresh ways of thinking,” Süssli said. The gender issue is only one aspect. “My aim is to have a Swiss army that is open for everyone,” Süssli said. There should be a place in the army for anyone who wants to help protect Switzerland’s security, no matter which faith, language or gender, he continued. Süssli did not rule out having foreigners serve eventually. At present the Swiss constitution rules out foreigners as you need Swiss citizenship for military service. But he this may be reviewed in the future, he said. The army chief, a cyber-defence specialist who took up his post at the beginning of the year, recently warned that the service would be down by around 30,000 soldiers - a quarter of its size - by 2030. Parliament’s rejection of the civilian service law has made the situation a bit more difficult, he said. This would have made access to civilian service - the alternative to military service - more difficult. The aim of the reform had been to boost dwindling army numbers. The government is planning to issue a report later this year on the role of the army and civilian service. All able-bodied Swiss men are called up to do military service from the age of 19. If declared fit for military service - as on average two-thirds of conscripts are –-the only way out is to opt for civilian community service on ethical grounds.  The Swiss army was deployed to support healthcare workers during height of the coronavirus outbreak in Switzerland.
2020-06-26;Wage gap widening in Switzerland, says trade union;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wage-gap-widening-in-switzerland--says-trade-union/45862384;Top company chief executives took home an average of 148 times more in salary than the lowest paid workers at the same firms last year, says Swiss trade union Unia. The wage gap at Switzerland’s largest 37 companies increased from a ratio of 142:1 ratio in 2018. Pharma firm Roche’s CEO Severin Schwan was the worst offender with his CHF15.1 million earning ($15.9 million) weighing in at 308 times greater than the lowest salary in the group. Bank UBS’s Sergio Ermotti was in second place with a wage gap ratio of 241:1, followed by Ulf Mark Schneider of food company Nestlé who got 230 times more than the lowest wage earner. Unia also says that some companies are bending rules that ban excessive severance packages. So-called “golden handshake” deals have been outlawed in Switzerland following the acceptance of the “Minder initiative” by a nationwide vote in 2013. The trade union accuses both Credit Suisse and ABB of twisting the spirit of the popular vote by awarding departing CEOs excessively generous parting gifts. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam is likely to receive some CHF30 million in deferred bonuses after leaving the bank under a cloud following a “spygate” scandal. Former CEO of ABB Ulrich Spiesshofer will be paid CHF13 million two years after stepping down, because of a non-compete contract, says Unia. The trade union also sharply criticised some companies for awarding the lowest paid workers so little. This could be as low as CHF4,000 per month, which Unia considers below the minimum level to subsist in Switzerland. In contrast, shareholders enjoyed a bumper year in dividend payments and share buyback schemes totaling some CHF63 billion among the companies surveyed. Nestlé led the way with just over CHF17 billion while Novartis paid out CHF12 billion. In some cases, the payments went into the pockets of family owners who are also the largest shareholders. Unia reserved its most stringent condemnation for companies that put workers on shortened working hours during the coronavirus pandemic yet still paid out dividends.
2020-06-25;SwissCovid tracing app launched ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/tracking-the-virus_swisscovid-tracing-app-launched-/45860402;A contact tracing app is now available in Switzerland for newer smartphones to help tackle Covid-19. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, everyone with whom that person was in contact in previous days – within two metres and for more than 15 minutes – is alerted via the app to isolate themselves and get tested. SwissCovid was developed by the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich. Smartphones use Bluetooth technology to communicate with each another anonymously. The system is decentralised with contacts and data stored on devices rather than on an external server. It is the first in the world to use the OS updates from Apple and Google. But people with older phones won't be able to access the app. You need an iPhone 6s or a more recent model, or an Android 6. The larger mobile phone providers Swisscom, Salt and Sunrise say approximately every fifth smartphone will be excluded. There’s no exchange with tracing apps from other countries although this is technically feasible. 
2020-06-25;Hotelplan cuts jobs amid coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hotelplan-cuts-jobs-amid-coronavirus/45859882;Swiss tour operator Hotelplan has announced it is cutting around 430 jobs, including 170 in Switzerland as the coronavirus crisis takes a toll on the travel industry. “The effects of the corona pandemic have shaken and practically paralysed the entire travel industry around the world,” Hotelplan announced on Thursday. The company is part of the Migros Group and currently employs some 2,277 people around the world. With no rapid recovery in sight, the company said that it has had to take “painful and unavoidable” measures. In addition to job cuts, the company is scaling back its branch network. Business units in Switzerland, Germany and Great Britain are all expected to be affected. In Switzerland, 12 of its 98 travel offices will be closed. “The developments in the travel industry are a nightmare for all of us. It hurts that we can no longer offer employees a perspective,” said Hotelplan Group CEO Thomas Stirnimann. The company says the measures aim to help secure as many jobs as possible in the long term, and to maintain competitiveness. A social plan has been put in place for affected employees in Switzerland. The company is also in consultations with employee associations in other countries. Several media outletsExternal link have also reported that airport ground services and baggage handler Swissport is set to cut more than half of its United Kingdom workforce as airlines deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The firm, which is owned by the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, announced that it plans to cut some 4,500 jobs in the UK. Swissport employs around 64,000 people in 300 airports in 47 countries. This includes ground service personal baggage handlers and check-in staff. Chief executive Jason Holt said that the business has weathered other crises but has “never experienced anything like Covid-19 in our lifetimes.” “We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world.” While some airlines are expanding travel routes as lockdowns are lifted, Swissport has said its revenue is forecast to be almost 50% lower than last year due to the crisis.
2020-06-25;Switzerland launches SwissCovid tracing app for residents;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-launches-swisscovid-contact-tracing-app-for-residents/45859778;"Swiss residents will be able to download the new SwissCovid smartphone app from June 25. The contact-tracing system aims to prevent the spread of the virus while guaranteeing privacy and control over personal data for users. SwissCovidExternal link, the Swiss coronavirus contact tracing app, can now be downloaded on the smartphones of over eight million residents, after parliament passed a legal amendment to govern its use and data protection. From June 25, the app will be available from the Apple App and Google Play stores for the public to test it. This concludes an experimental test phase which, since May 25, has involved 15,000 users in the federal administration, the army, hospitals and the federal technology institutes. They were recruited to test the app’s functionality and safety. One of the biggest remaining challenges is to convince large numbers of the public to use the app to ensure it works properly, say federal public health officials and researchers at the Zurich and Lausanne federal institutes of technology. They developed the app in collaboration with a team of scientists and experts around Europe, and the federal government’s computing science and telecommunications department and the Swiss company Ubique. We want to reassure citizens that this app ensures maximum protection of data and privacy, thanks to the decentralisation of the information and the Bluetooth technology, which blocks geolocation,” Sang-il Kim, head of the digital transformation division at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), told swissinfo.ch. Kim stressed the voluntary and non-discriminatory nature of this approach to coronavirus tracing, as required by Swiss law. He pointed out that the app can only be used in containing the epidemic and confers no particular advantage or disadvantage on anyone who decides to use it. SwissCovid works via a decentralised system of data storage, designed to respect users’ private life and prevent any improper use of personal data. All operations potentially affecting privacy, like analysing contacts to find who might have been infected – smartphones will exchange coded, anonymous signals known as 'Ephemeral IDs' every 2.5 or 5 minutes – and notifications will be done directly on the cell phone and not via a central server, as would happen with centralised apps. This crucial feature ensures that data collected by the app remain on the user’s device for no more than 14 days. Only where infection has been confirmed by a test will information (in anonymous and encrypted form) from the infected user be moved to the federal government’s central server. And the user first has to decide to share his or her information with the app using a code received from the cantonal government. This information will not be tagged with a precise identity and will not say anything about the individual; it will just say that the person is infected. The SwissCovid app is the first in Europe to use the application programming interfaces (API) of Google and Apple. These allow devices using Android and iOS to work together and give users direct control of their own data from their own device. The approach uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption to establish contact between two smartphones that are within at least 1.5 metres of each other for a period of at least 15 minutes, ensuring both privacy and low power consumption. According to Carmela Troncoso, who heads the security and privacy engineering laboratory at EPFL which is leading the DP-3T project (decentralised tracing to ensure privacy), this system means a significant change in the way mass technologies are designed and developed. “For the first time, a solution was designed for the use by millions of people with a built-in privacy guarantee right from the start. This never happened before – until now,” she told swissinfo.ch. Troncoso said the pressure for change came from lively public and political debate about safeguarding personal data and from the transparent approach adopted by Google and Apple, which in this case worked together in a very open way. We are looking at a cultural transformation in the making. At last we are realising that technology is an indispensable part of our lives and that computer architecture and infrastructure are crucial because they define power relations , Troncoso added. Although the try-out phase verified the solidity of the system in ensuring anonymity and safeguarding of data, there are some critical issues that might frustrate tracing. The first concerns the risk of creating “false positives” or “false negatives”. Bluetooth technology, which is used to make contact in close proximity, may be affected by various extraneous factors. For one thing, physical obstacles like walls and other people or objects between two smartphones could affect the accuracy of signal pickup. In such cases it is hard to tell if the contact really came from within 1.5 metres away. The use of masks or other protective devices not recognised by the app might falsify results too. Nontheless, Kim is confident that calibration testing has provided very positive results, although complete accuracy in measuring distance cannot be guaranteed, and the 1.5-metre calculation is in fact an approximation. For Troncoso, it’s not really a problem: There’s not much real difference between 1.5 metres and 1.75 metres, let’s say. The really decisive factor for infection is the time-length of exposure to the virus . The second big challenge is getting the Swiss system to work with apps from other countries. “We’ve done all we can to develop a solution that will ensure smooth operation with systems elsewhere. On this point, the APIs of Apple and Google have been of enormous help,” explained Kim. However, system compatibility is not yet conclusively established, due to the lack of an agreement between countries that would specify the same degree of data protection and cyber-security. In an attempt to create a common basis to work on, the European Union recently published  guidelinesExternal link specifying a basis for compatibility of tracing apps in different European countries. There is also a risk that at some time in the future Apple and Google might change the whole game in their own corporate interests by altering their standards. “So far, Google and Apple have been nothing but transparent in this situation, and they took the route of standardising and implementing the solution that was least invasive of people’s privacy. But who knows if this gesture of goodwill might turn out to be a double-edged sword that could be wielded to justify new data-gathering standards or future abuse of data gathered, say, for example, so as to get to the stage where they can dominate the market in telemedicine?” wrote Matthew Dennis and Georgy Ishmaev, two researchers on the ethical aspects of emergent technologies and data at the Technical University of Delft."
2020-06-25;Audit office denies ‘mass phenomenon’ of Covid-19 credit abuse;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/audit-office-denies--mass-phenomenon--of-covid-19-credit-abuse/45859758;An interim report on government pay-outs to businesses during the Covid-19 crisis has revealed that there is suspected abuse in less than 1% of cases. The Federal Audit Office investigated some 94,000 coronavirus loans amounting to CHF11.4 billion ($12 billion). It found indications of abuse in about 400 cases, which amounts to about CHF88 million in guarantees. This doesn’t represent a “mass phenomenon”, according to the reportExternal link released this week. As of May 20, the government had committed CHF72 billion to help cushion the blow of the coronavirus pandemic. The audit office report analysed the dual goals of speed and limiting abuse in the distribution of government relief package. There had been media reports of suspected Covid-19 credit abuse, but this is the first representative analysis of the situation. In late May, the Office of the Attorney General of canton Vaud opened an investigation into suspected fraud and money laundering linked to financial aid given to several Swiss firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Most of the abuse concerns dividends that have been paid despite a ban, double payments or incorrect information on revenue. In one in ten applications the declared turnover deviates by more than 25% from the amount that was specified for the calculation of value added tax.  The report also looked at partial unemployment pay-outs, which as of May 6 amounted to CHF1 billion. More than 700,000 employees, or every seventh person in the workforce in Switzerland, were affected by some unemployment during the crisis. The average amount paid to businesses was CHF122,000. About 43 reports of alleged abuse in partial unemployment benefits were forwarded to the Federal Audit Office by the end of May. Brigitte Christ, deputy head of the Swiss Federal Audit Office, told Swiss public television, SRF, that in order to get the money to people as quickly as possible, some checks were reduced or not done at all. However, she cautioned that these cases still need to be fully investigated. “It will only be possible over time to determine how many abuses are hidden behind the funds allocated,” she said. The audit office has now sent its report to the Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).
2020-06-24;Government to pay for Covid tests to contain pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-to-pay-for-covid-tests-to-contain-pandemic/45857796;The Swiss government has agreed to foot the bill for medical tests for coronavirus infections to encourage the population to participate in prevention efforts. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the government would take over the costs for an average of 8,000 tests daily for a total of about CHF290 million ($307 million) this year. “Cost must not be hurdle for anybody,” he told a news conference on Wednesday. Berset stressed the importance of testing as part of the policy to respect hygiene rules, including keeping a 1.5-metere distance from other people and tracking of cases of infections. He added that it is key to seek a test even in cases of light symptoms. It is currently possible to test about 15,000 people daily or even more, if necessary, both to find out if somebody has the been infected or not, but also for virus anti-bodies, according to Stefan Kuster of the Federal Health Office. The tests cost CHF169 and CHF113 respectively. The government decision takes effect on Thursday and is aimed at ending a dispute between the cantonal authorities and the health insurance companies. Berset also announced that a tracing programme will be available to the public across Switzerland as of Thursday. He called for a widespread use of a smartphone application, known as SwissCovid, to complement the conventional tracking of infections by the cantonal authorities. “It is key that a maximum of people download the app but its use remains voluntary,” Berset explained. Parliament earlier this month agreed the legal basis for the use of the app amid concerns about data protection. It follows a technical trial phase of several weeks. The app uses Bluetooth waves to allow smartphones to communicate with each other anonymously, allowing app stores users to be notified if they came into contact with infected people.
2020-06-24;A Swiss-Japanese alliance that has thrived in the crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/a-swiss-japanese-alliance-that-has-thrived-in-the-crisis/45857366;It was the start of one of the most unusual cross-cultural marriages when Roche bought a controlling stake in Chugai Pharmaceutical for $1.4bn back in 2002, promising arm’s length management.  In the course of the 18 months of negotiations it took to reach a deal, Chugai, a Japanese pioneer in biotechnology, presented a single sheet of paper with a list of conditions it would not budge on, the main ones being management autonomy and the continued listing of its shares in Tokyo. If anyone described the deal as a merger, Chugai, with annual revenue less than a tenth of its Swiss parent, quietly corrected this to “strategic alliance”, but few took those words at face value.  Nearly two decades later, the partnership has not only survived but has prospered during the coronavirus crisis, with the two companies now trialling their rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra as a potential treatment for people who are critically ill with Covid-19. With investors pinning their hopes on the drug, Chugai passed a new milestone this week, replacing Sony as Japan’s fifth most valuable company as its shares hit another all-time record. The stock has risen more than 70 per cent since the start of the year, adding $40bn to its market capitalisation. Roche has added nearly $30bn.  The success of the Roche-Chugai partnership stands out in an industry where deals at far bigger prices — such as Johnson & Johnson’s $30bn purchase of Swiss biotech group Actelion in 2017 — have struggled to impress investors, but also because cross-border deals are particularly challenging in Japan. Companies can be resistant to foreign ownership and their natural instinct is to imagine themselves as buyer rather than bought.  Many alliances, even long-enduring ones such as that between Nissan and Renault, have faltered when faced with pressures such as a full merger, deeper technology transfer or, naturally, testing times of flagging financial performance. Chugai says it had its own merger scare in August 2014. According to Tatsuro Kosaka, chief executive, that summer still brings back bitter memories of a panicked midnight call at a hot springs resort, informing him of media reports that Roche was set to offer $10bn to take full control. Cutting his holiday short, he drove back to company headquarters in Tokyo the next day. Regardless of Roche’s intentions at the time, Mr Kosaka insists no talks about any such deal took place. He also rules out a full merger in the future.  Instead, Roche has its 60 per cent stake and three executives on Chugai’s nine-member board, but continues its hands-off approach. There is no one from the Swiss parent, for example, in the senior management team. This type of alliance is now being touted as a model for cross-border deals, but autonomy does have a cost. Chugai needs to keep on developing innovative drugs — not just to boost the financial performance of both companies but also to maintain trust within Roche that it can leave its Japanese business alone. So far the relationship has worked well. Chugai has delivered three key drugs — Actemra, haemophilia blockbuster Hemlibra, and lung cancer drug Alecensa — that have made a meaningful contribution to Roche’s global sales. At Chugai, sales have tripled and profits have increased more than 10-fold in the past 18 years, thanks in large part to Roche’s global sales network. Royalty fees from the Swiss parent have also allowed the Japanese company to focus on decades of costly research it would not have been able to afford if it had gone it alone.  Actemra may be in the global spotlight now but Japan’s first monoclonal antibody drug was created with Osaka University after 20 years of research dating back to the 1980s. When it was first approved by Japanese authorities in 2005, it was to treat the rare Castleman disease before it was launched a few years later to treat rheumatoid arthritis.  During the current crisis, the Roche-Chugai alliance will be able to make use of combined manufacturing resources to ensure it can meet global demand for Actemra, depending on trial results. In addition to Chugai’s plant in Japan, special permission has been granted for Roche unit Genentech’s site in Oregon to undertake part of the drug production process. The alliance has had a huge boost this year because of the hopes for Actemra, but investor enthusiasm is likely to wane without firm scientific proof of its effectiveness against Covid-19. And in the longer term, success will hinge more on whether Chugai can deliver another blockbuster.  The case of Nissan and Renault, although in a different industry, shows trust built over decades can abruptly collapse especially when a relationship is tied to certain individuals. But the Roche-Chugai alliance certainly provides useful lessons in these uncertain times for what it might take to keep a cross-border relationship intact. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020
2020-06-24;Swiss health official warns Covid-19 outbreaks inevitable;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-health-official-warns-covid-19-outbreaks-inevitable/45857296;Switzerland risks new outbreaks of coronavirus cases similar to those in neighboring Germany, a senior health official has warned. Stefan Kuster who heads the unit of communicable diseases at the Federal Health Office, said it was illusory to believe that Switzerland “can prevent clusters” of the disease. His remarks were published on Wednesday’s newspapers from the Tamedia publishing group. Kuster compared the current situation in Switzerland with a smouldering fire that triggers fresh flare-ups that need to be put out. Kuster said the solid economic situation of Switzerland was probably a factor which helped prevent the worst. He was referring to a major case of Covid-19 contagions at a meat factory in northern Germany where hygiene and living conditions for many employees were critical. The health expert refused to rule out a new spike of coronavirus infections in the next few months, noting that scientists still don’t know enough about the virus to combat it successfully. He also said mandatory hygiene masks on public transport were “a valid possible option” if the population was not willing to respect official recommendations. He said it was up to cantonal authorities to act if necessary. The Swiss government has stopped short of making the wearing of protective face coverings mandatory but recommended people do so in cases where passengers can’t keep a minimum distance from others. There are currently about 200 Covid-19 patients in isolation in Switzerland and more than 600 in quarantine. The daily rate of infections has dropped to between about ten and 35 cases in the past few weeks despite a staggered easing of restrictions on public life. A new online survey found that nearly 80% of 10,519 respondents are in favour of masks in public transport. The poll was published by the Tamedia group on Wednesday, but the results are not representative according to the newspapers. Previous polls by other organisations did not find a clear majority in favour of mandatory masks in trains and buses. 
2020-06-24;Swiss Scientific and Medical Corps: a new idea to fight pandemics;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-scientific-and-medical-corps--a-new-way-to-fight-pandemics/45855892;"Switzerland should create a new type of scientific-military collaboration to address public health challenges like the one we are now experiencing, argues Rudolph Thomson. The response of many countries to the Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized by calls for a “war footing”, and rightly so, for this is war even though the enemy is unarmed and invisible. It therefore behooves us to expand our philosophy and approach to armed conflict with complementary scientific and medical capabilities and resources to fight unarmed conflicts. In an extraordinary move on March 16, the Swiss government deployed up to 8,000 troops to help in the combat against the coronavirus. It was the first deployment of the Swiss army since the Second World War. Accounts of the deployment have not dwelt on battlefield strategy and tactics, nor on military hardware or munitions; instead, the talk and action have centered on intensive care units, hospital beds, medical equipment and supplies, and various medical equipment including masks, gloves, and disinfectant gel for frontline healthcare workers and the rest of us. That is the point. These are some of the assets required to fight an unarmed conflict such as Covid-19. If the Swiss Epidemic Act had more clearly defined a collaborative role for the military and public health, and if we had invested in the required infrastructure, the response to Covid-19 would have been more efficient and cost-effective. Widespread lockdowns and immobilization of the country and economy may have been avoidable. I fervently support the continuing existence of the Swiss army and its conscription policy to defend the population should it be necessary. I do not propose curtailing the functions of the army. But we can and should seriously consider its composition to include a sizeable corps of scientific and medical personnel encompassing numerous types of expertise and disciplines. Under such an arrangement, the Swiss army and the Federal Office of Public Health would jointly serve as competent authority, the former focusing on security and logistics and the latter on detection, containment and eliminating the disease. The enterprise would be funded from the budgets of the army and the Federal Office of Public Health. Private sector entities with a vested interest in public health would contribute both financial and human resources. A new Swiss Scientific and Medical Corps (Swiss Sci-Med Corps) could include up to 20,000 “medical personnel” including scientists, epidemiologists, immunologists, virologists, cardiologists, radiologists, disease investigators, nurses, medical technicians and other professionals. Personnel would be recruited (as well as conscripted) from technical schools and universities and be stationed throughout the cantons. The Swiss Sci-Med Corps would be structured as a public-private partnership with Swiss scientific and medical research labs, universities and medical schools. Associations and collaboration with agencies such as the World Health Organization and various centers for disease control would be undertaken as deemed appropriate by political, military and medical authorities. Aside from rogue attacks on Switzerland by both sides during the Second World War, it has been some 170 years since we have experienced fatalities from an armed conflict, in the Sonderbund War which cost us fewer than 100 lives. In the time since, another unarmed conflict, the Spanish Flu, cost our country more than 25,000 lives in 1918. But Switzerland’s reputation as one of the wealthiest and healthiest countries in the world and as the second-ranked nation in healthcare expenditures did not impede the invasion by the coronavirus. In fact, it has also forced us into economic and financial support measures representing more than 9% of GDP. Notwithstanding the valiant response of Swiss authorities, the overall costs will weigh heavily on the nation for years. The social costs in terms of stress, depression and other mental health issues will be profound and exacerbated by a lingering fear that a resurgence or new outbreaks would be devastating. A competent, well-organized Swiss Sci-Med Corps would have the potential to become a new pillar of the Swiss economy by providing its expertise and available capacity to multilateral agencies, countries or regions when not needed domestically. This endeavor would build on and enhance Switzerland’s world renown for quality, reliability and efficiency. Thus, epidemiological and other large-scale medical services could become important contributors to the nation’s GDP. The Corps would join tourism, hospitality, watchmaking, precision tools & equipment and chocolates as key pillars of the Swiss economy. Now is the time to build on the rich heritage and peaceful institutions that so define the Swiss nation. A Swiss Sci-Med Corps would invoke the proud legacy of the Red Cross of Henri Dunant, Henri Dufour and their eminent co-founders. It would also honor and advance the legacy and efficacy of Dufour’s “gentle” army in its conduct of the Sonderbund War. This inspired our 1848 constitution which revealed how the collective spirit of our cantons could form a Switzerland that is ‘one for all, all for one’. Can we renew that spirit and share it with the rest of the world?"
2020-06-22;Government re-launches campaign against immigration curbs;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-re-launches-campaign-against-immigration-curbs/45852238;Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter has warned of the damage of an initiative to scrap a free movement of people accord with the European Union. Re-launching the government’s campaign ahead of a nationwide vote on September 27, Keller-Sutter said approval of the right-wing initiative would seriously undermine relations with Switzerland’s main trading partner. “It is not the time for political experiments, certainly not now. Our economy needs a clear perspective to be able to recover from the coronavirus crisis,” Keller-Sutter told a news conference on Monday. The People’s Party argues the free movement deal, allowing workers from the EU access to the Swiss labour market, leads to lower salaries and unemployment. The vote was initially scheduled for May but had to be rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions on daily life in Switzerland. Keller-Sutter presented the government’s position alongside representatives of the main trade union umbrella organisations and employers’ associations. She repeatedly stressed the cooperation of employers and unions with the government and the joint efforts to protect the domestic workforce, notably those above the age of 60, against unfair competition. “We need certain social measures in a direct democracy to maintain the system of free trade,” she said. Hans-Ulrich Bigler, director of the Association of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises, warned of a lack of skilled workers if the initiative is accepted by voters. “It would destroy jobs and threaten the foundation of the Swiss economy,” he said. Pierre-Yves Maillard, president of the Trade Union Federation, accused the People’s Party of targeting a series of measures that seek to protect workers’ rights and salary levels. Adrian Wüthrich of Travail Suisse added that approval of the initiative would worsen the economic crisis. He called for a clear legal basis to prevent uncertainty. For his part, Valentin Vogt of the Swiss Employers Federation argued that immigration restrictions would lead to a “worst case scenario for the country”. People’s Party parliamentarian Céline Amaudruz dismissed the arguments as false. “For more than 20 or 30 years, our opponents keep repeating the same story that Switzerland could not exist without the help of the EU,” she told Swiss public television RTS. She said Switzerland was much better on its own and that the trade balance with the 27-nation bloc was becoming more negative. The People’s Party and the conservative Group for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland handed in enough signatures nearly two years ago for a nationwide ballot on immigration curbs. Many right-wing critics were disappointed by parliament’s perceived slow implementation of a previous initiative to cap immigration from EU member countries in 2014. “We respect the people’s will,” Amaudruz said and referring to growing unemployment she added: “Our priority is to put the Swiss population first.” The People’s Party argues Switzerland should be able to regulate immigration on its own and deal with the risks of the EU cancelling a series of bilateral treaties negotiated 20 years ago on labour, transport, trade, science and agriculture. Most political parties, the 26 cantons and parliament have recommended that the initiative be rejected in September – in what has been dubbed as one of the key votes for Switzerland in the near future. The People’s Party says it has launched its campaign to win support for its initiative at the beginning of this year, but it declined to give further information about planned events.
2020-06-22;Switzerland eased lockdown measures too soon, warns top official;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-eased-lockdown-measures-too-soon--warns-top-official/45850834;The head of the Swiss Covid-19 taskforce has warned that the lifting of lockdown restrictions last Friday was premature. “We are not ready for the most recent easing,” Matthias Egger, who leads the scientific task force set up by the Swiss government to coordinate advice and research on the virus, told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper. “We are still lacking, like previously, a functioning monitoring system for the whole of Switzerland. It’s also unclear how good the contact tracing system is.” On June 19 the Swiss government announced that it was simplifying and lifting most of the remaining restrictions introduced to combat the spread of coronavirus, as of June 22. The recommended social distance is being reduced from two to 1.5 metres with immediate effect. From Monday, events drawing up to 1,000 people will be allowed (as opposed to 300 at present), provided contact tracing can be guaranteed. Only gatherings of more than 1,000 remain banned until the end of August. Restrictions on when businesses such as bars and restaurants can be open will also be lifted. People will no longer be required to sit down inside. From tomorrow civil and political gatherings and demonstrations will be allowed but people are required to wear masks. The government is also ending its recommendation that people work from home wherever possible. It will be up to employers to decide and put the necessary safety measures in place.  Egger remains cautious, warning that from a scientific point of view there is a high risk that the easing could endanger the Alpine country if the virus again spreads. The number of new infections has fallen from the peak of 1,000 cases a day in mid-March to 10-35 in the past few weeks. Hospitals have shown their ability to cope and have not been overwhelmed as feared.  The head of the taskforce said the fight against the epidemic had gone well so far. But he warned that the number of new infections appeared to have increased in the past two weeks and that it is likely that the reproduction rate is 1 or higher. The reproduction rate, or 'R' value, estimates how many people an infected person passes the virus on to. Experts say that number needs to stay below one for the spread to remain low. Egger said there is a risk that the number of cases may increase sharply in the future. The Covid-19 taskforce considers it premature to lift new restrictions, he added. He said the recent increase in new cases and rate of contagion was probably due to the easing announced on May 11. The effects of further lockdown easings on May 28, June 6, and June 15 are not yet clear he added. The official stressed the importance of contact tracing and quarantine measures in the cantons, as well as extensive data collection. Tests must also be carried out quickly and on a large scale in high-risk situations. If an outbreak is suspected, the individual’s entire entourage must be tested, not just close contacts.
2020-06-22;SwissCovid app will be available for download this week;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swisscovid-app-will-be-available-for-download-this-week/45852228; Swiss residents are encouraged to participate in Covid-19 contact tracing via mobile phones from June 25. “Using the SwissCovid app is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively it can help us to contain the new coronavirus,” announced the Federal Office of Public Health on its website. There will be Android and iPhone versions ready for download from the Apple Store and Google Play. The app complements the classic method of contact tracing employed by the cantons. It anonymously measures how long and how close a phone was to others that have the app. “It records any encounters that it has with other phones (closer than 1.5 metres and for longer than 15 minutes in any one day), as these are the situations in which you are most likely to become infected with the virus,” explains the health office. Parliament approved the app’s legal basis earlier this month. Developed by the government and the two federal technology institutes, the app has been tested for security loopholes. 
2020-06-22;Massive decline in foreign investment in Switzerland expected;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/massive-decline-in-foreign-investment-in-switzerland-expected/45852164;An increase in foreign direct investment in 2019 is likely to be followed by a drop of up to 50% in 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19.  In a European comparison, Switzerland has risen four places and is ranked 17th in terms of investment projects by foreign companies, according to the Ernst & Young (EY) study published on Monday. The Alpine nation attracted 73 new projects last year, registering an increase of 20%. France took the lead followed by the UK and Germany, with Europe attracting a total of 6,412 projects by foreign companies in 2019.  Switzerland was also busy returning the favour. In 2019, Swiss companies announced 258 foreign investment projects – which is 12% fewer than in 2018. Most of these investments were made in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.   Ernst & Young predict a rather grim outlook for 2020 with inflows of foreign direct investment expected to fall between 30% and 50% in Europe depending on the country and sector.   For the countries of Europe, this means that competition between them for foreign investment will continue to increase. In order to be successful, they must be prepared to the challenges that are currently evolving due to the coronavirus pandemic – including the redesign of supply chains, the introduction of innovative technologies and the development of new ways of processing customers, said Fabian Denneborg, Partner and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions at EY in Switzerland.  
2020-06-22;How horses helped create a faster Covid-19 diagnostic test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-horses-helped-create-a-faster-covid-19-diagnostic-test/45845832;When Covid-19 interrupted one Swiss start-up’s plans for diagnosing respiratory diseases in horses, it decided to apply the technology to testing Covid-19 in humans. If you’ve never heard of ender diagnostics, there’s a good reason for that. Before April, the company didn’t exist. Earlier this year, Swiss start-up LiVET was about to ramp up field testing of its isothermal test designed to diagnose four of the most common respiratory diseases in horses when the coronavirus shutdown happened. Travel plans were put on hold and some machines LiVET planned to test diseases in horses were needed for Covid-19 testing. With several bright scientists twiddling their thumbs, LiVET CEO Tim Pfister wondered if the company could apply some of its knowledge and resources to developing a test for Covid-19 in humans. “We didn’t know how long the lockdown would last so we started asking ourselves if we could take what we know about diagnosing respiratory diseases in horses to develop a test for Covid-19,” Pfister told swissinfo.ch. Pfister’s team doubled in size and, with existing investors and some additional private financing, created a new company: ender diagnostics. Earlier this week, less than two months after establishing the company, it received the CE mark – the European certification for compliance with safety and performance standards – for its first rapid Covid-19 diagnostics testExternal link called ender LAB. With the CE mark, ender can now sell its test to hospital labs in Europe and Switzerland. In July, it plans to launch a faster test and is also working on the “mobile ender test” which pairs the technology with a hand-held, portable device that would allow testing to be done anywhere such as an airport without the big machines found in labs or hospitals. The mobile device could run eight or 16 samples simultaneously. Ender isn’t the only start-up throwing its hat in the ring. After test shortages at the outset of the pandemic, there was a boom in the number of manufacturers developing tests to diagnose the coronavirus infection. Some, like ender, are start-ups whose plans have been sidelined because of Covid-19 but have the scientific expertise and are agile enough to seize a good business opportunity. The easing of regulatory requirements for Covid-19 testing has also helped companies like ender. Recognising the need to make tests available as quickly as possible, European Union and US authorities made it easier for manufacturers to get tests on the market. A new, stricter medical device directive was supposed to go into effect on May 26, but in early April the European Commission agreed to postponeExternal link this until 2021 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. This meant the old directiveExternal link (98/79/EC) applied to in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, which makes manufacturers such as ender responsible for ensuring compliance with standards without third-party verification. The Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products – Swissmedic – confirmed to swissinfo.ch that it has received documentation from the company but cautions that the CE mark indicates neither approval nor authorisation and that the full responsibility for the test’s effectiveness rests on the company. As of early April, the EU reportedExternal link that 78 PCR tests and 13 rapid antigen tests had the CE mark. According to the EU databaseExternal link, there are now more than 100 PCR tests. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also issued over 100 Emergency Use Authorizations for both diagnostic and antibody tests. But faster regulatory approvals have had consequences, such as when the US Food and Drug Administration was forced to revoke more than 40 antibody testsExternal link (used to identify past infection). The European Safety Federation also identified falsified documentsExternal link for protective equipment and testing. How was ender able to transition its technology so seamlessly from horses to humans?  Pfister said that working with nasal swabs, as opposed to other testing material such as blood, makes it relatively easy to transfer know-how. “What we have done is mastered the nasal swab test type,” he says. “That has helped us be fast with the development of the Covid-19 [test] and achieve good results.” Other veterinary diagnostics companies such Germany-based AniCon have also applied their expertise to the human coronavirus. Despite ender’s detour to use its technology on humans, Pfister doesn’t plan to give up on horses and potentially other species. “Diagnostics for horses is a niche market and a perfect start for a start-up in the veterinary market as there are lower regulatory hurdles and a good return on investment.” 
2020-06-22;France to honour Switzerland at national day festivities;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/france-to-honour-switzerland-at-national-day-festivities/45852078;To express its gratitude for treating French Covid-19 patients during the height of the coronavirus crisis, France is including Switzerland in its national celebration. French President Emmanuel Macron has invited Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset to attend the French National Day ceremony in Paris on July 14. With this gesture, Macron wants to thank Switzerland for admitting 49 French Covid-19 patients in its local hospitals. France has also invited the health ministers of Austria, Germany and Luxembourg. This year, the French national holiday ceremony will take place on the Place de la Concorde rather than the Champs-Élysées. The military parade will be limited to a flying squadron. There will also be a tribute to nursing staff. Some 2,000 participants and 2,500 guests are expected.
2020-06-22;Swiss public transport expected to lose CHF1.5 billion due to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-public-transport-expected-to-lose-chf1.5-billion-due-to-covid-19/45850844;The collapse in the number of commuters and other passengers on Swiss trains and buses due to the pandemic is likely to leave a big hole in the finances of public transport companies. The Le Matin Dimanche and SonntagsZeitung newspapers reported on Sunday that Alliance SwissPass, the national public transport organisation, expects the number of yearly national train passes to fall by 6% and half-price annual passes to drop by 1% by the end of the year. This should result in a financial loss of CHF119 million for passes alone. If this is added to the fall in local passes and individual train and bus tickets, SwissPass expects an overall loss of CHF1.5-1.8 billion in turnover for 2020. Despite pupils returning to school as part of the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, trains and buses remain only half full, transport companies say.  Passenger numbers have increased very gradually, and currently stand at around 55% of normal capacity in regional trains and 45% on intercity trains.  At the height of the pandemic, passenger volume dropped by 90%.  Post Bus – the yellow buses seen on many Swiss roads – also said that passenger numbers were well down compared with before the coronavirus crisis, but were slowly picking up. There was also an 80-90% drop in passenger numbers at Post Bus during March and April, the company added. Now the buses are about half full. On Monday, train company BLS announced that it had transported about 60% fewer passengers than normal since the start of the lockdown. It predicts a loss of CHF40 million on its regional lines this year. Next Wednesday, the Swiss government is expected to discuss a project to compensate public transport companies. A parliamentary transport committee will then consider the issue in order to finalise plans before autumn.
2020-06-21;Thousands more Swiss residents claim welfare due to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/thousands-more-swiss-residents-claim-welfare-due-to-covid-19/45851254;Nearly 8,300 residents, in particular the self-employed and others on short-term work, have been forced to claim welfare benefits in Switzerland since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of new welfare claimants in Switzerland has risen by 8,300 to 280,000, according to the Swiss Conference for Social Welfare (SKOS). Christoph Eymann, the president of SKOS, told NZZ am Sonntag that the number of new claimants increased by 3% between the beginning of March and end of May. The numbers increased especially in “hotspots” such as French- and Italian-speaking regions, and in central Switzerland, he added. According to SKOS’s median scenario, the total number of new welfare claimants may increase by 75,000 by 2022. Of these, one third are likely to be self-employed and one quarter refugees and asylum seekers who have been given temporary residence in Switzerland. This should result in an additional financial burden for the cantons and communes estimated at CHF3-4 billion, which Eymann hopes will be shared between the different regions. He said if the SKOS’s scenarios are confirmed the cantons will require additional federal funds over the next two years.
2020-06-20;Switzerland organises humanitarian aid flight to Venezuela;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-organises-humanitarian-aid-flight-to-venezuela/45849706;Switzerland has flown nearly 100 tonnes of relief aid, mainly medical supplies, to Venezuela to help with the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The Swiss government chartered a cargo plane to support the efforts of nine organisations - United Nations agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and NGOs - which had gathered supplies worth CHF2 million ($2.1 million) to help people in Venezuela. The relief aid included personal protective equipment for use in combating Covid-19, medicine, emergency equipment, hygienic articles and equipment to prepare drinking water to help around 1.2 million people, the Swiss foreign ministry said on June 19External link. The organisations shipped the relief supplies to Switzerland where they were reloaded at Zurich Airport and flown to Caracas on June 19. A team from the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit was also on board. Along with representatives from the Swiss embassy in Caracas and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the team supervised the handing over of the supplies to the organisations taking part on the ground.  “The operation demonstrates Switzerland's firm commitment to humanitarian principles and practice. It also makes it possible for Switzerland to lend support to extremely vulnerable populations in a highly polarised environment,” the ministry said. Since 2017, the Swiss authorities have provided aid worth CHF24 million to alleviate suffering in Venezuela. This year, it has allocated an additional CHF12 million in response to the humanitarian needs in the South American nation. The aim is to also have an impact on the neighbouring countries, where millions of Venezuelan citizens reside. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Switzerland has delivered relief supplies to several countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. In total, the Alpine nation has earmarked over CHF203 million for the global fight against Covid-19.
2020-06-20;Novartis ends hydroxychloroquine clinical trial ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/novartis-ends-hydroxychloroquine-clinical-trial-/45849700;Swiss drug giant Novartis is ending its trial of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19 after failing to find enough participants, it said on Friday. Basel-based Novartis began the clinical trial in April. Some 440 hospitalised patients with the virus were expected to participate in the study. But the pharma company said on June 19External link that it had decided to halt the trial due to “acute enrolment challenges that have made trial completion infeasible”. Novartis' move follows this week's US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to revoke emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19 on grounds it and a related drug, chloroquine, are unlikely to help patients. Hydroxychloroquine, also used to treat inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, has been caught in a political debate as US President Donald Trump promoted it, even though there was no scientific evidence that it helps against the new coronavirus. Several studies of the decades-old malaria drug including in Britain were recently halted after scientists concluded it was useless against COVID-19. Last week the World Health Organization halted the hydroxychloroquine arm of one of its trials. The recruitment challenge facing our hydroxychloroquine trial has made it unlikely that the clinical team will be able to collect meaningful data in a reasonable time frame to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with COVID-19, Novartis said. The pharmaceutical company said its study, so far, raised no safety issues and drew no conclusions about hydroxychloroquine's efficacy. Novartis had donated up to 130 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, including millions in the United States, and Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan two months ago claimed the drug was the company's biggest hope against the new coronavirus.
2020-06-19;Swiss could lead WHO coronavirus inquiry, suggests top official;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-could-lead-who-coronavirus-inquiry--suggests-top-official/45848514;The investigation into the World Health Organization's response to the coronavirus pandemic should be led by a national of a country like Switzerland, says former WHO boss Gro Harlem Brundtland. It should be someone who is not a party to the conflict between the major powers, she said, referring to the row between the US and China over WHO’s handling of the crisis. Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who now heads the WHO’s Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), was addressing a news conference in Geneva on Friday. US president Donald Trump announced in April he was cutting off funding to the WHO, accusing it of having promoted China's disinformation about the virus. WHO member states agreed at a virtual meeting in May to a review of how the organization handled the crisis. Many leaders may not have fully believed that a real pandemic like this could take place during their term of office, Brundtland told UN correspondents. I think that now many will realize that it can happen again in the coming years and all countries will have to be better prepared, she added. Last September, the GPMB called on governments and international institutions to invest more in pandemic preparedness. It believed the threat of a pandemic that would kill tens of millions of people was real . In total, it noted that only 59 countries had developed national plans. Many leaders now understand the implications of such a crisis for the entire society and economy, Brundtland said. The former WHO boss is calling for reform of the International Health Regulations, which guide the multilateral response to health crises, including the issue of travel restrictions. The GPMB will propose recommendations in its next report in September.
2020-06-19;Access to civilian service will not be restricted after all;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/access-to-civilian-service-will-not-be-restricted-after-all/45848372; The House of Representatives has scuppered plans to make access to civilian service - the alternative to military service - more difficult. The aim of the reform had been to boost dwindling army numbers. Earlier in the month the House of Representatives, like the Senate, had approved making access to civilian service more difficult, especially for people who have already completed part of their compulsory military service (by making them wait 12 months). But the chamber changed its mind when it came to the final vote on Friday. Supporters of the reform, including the government, had argued that the increasing popularity of the civilian service undermined the number of conscripts in the Swiss militia army. Opponents had slammed the proposal as a purely arbitrary measure. Pacifists and several political parties mainly on the left of the political spectrum had already announced that they would challenge the reform in a nationwide vote – a move that will now be dropped. “This is excellent news which we were not expecting,” Fabian Fivaz of the leftwing Green Party told Swiss public television RTSExternal link. Fivaz said that the coronavirus crisis had likely contributed to a change of heart, especially among some in the centre-right. “There were around 4,000 civilian volunteers who were supporting the emergency services and hospitals. I think this had an effect on the final result,” he said. Jacqueline de Quattro of the centre-right Radical party was concerned that military service numbers were falling. “Young people are turning away, preferring civilian service where they feel more useful. This is understandable but we still need and have the desire for an army for the defence and protection of our country,” she said. The army needed to become more attractive: being a soldier was not just marching and being present for duty, but also learning new skills and professions. This needed to be taken into account, she said. Civilian service was introduced in 1992 as an option notably for conscientious objectors who refused to serve in the country’s militia army. Access to civilian service was eased in 2009, leading to a temporary surge in applications. All able-bodied Swiss men are called up to do military service from the age of 19. If declared fit for military service – as on average two-thirds of conscripts are – the only way out is to opt for civilian community service on ethical grounds. This lasts 50% longer than military service. Switzerland is one of only a few European countries to continue with military service (like Austria). Neighbouring France has said that it is planning to reintroduce national service for all 16-year-olds.
2020-06-19;How Switzerland kept in touch during Covid-19 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-people-communicated-during-covid-19-in-switzerland/45848330;Researchers from the University of Zurich share how the coronavirus led them to redirect their research in order to better understand people’s communication habits during the pandemic, and what they found. When lockdown measures spread across Switzerland in mid-March, everyone’s lives were thrown into disarray. Like many others, we scrambled to figure out our home office situation while keeping tabs on far away family members. Work meetings, school classes, conferences, exercise regimes, birthday parties and happy hours were all moving online. As scholars who study people’s digital media uses at the University of Zurich’s Department of Communication and Media Research, much of society’s reaction to the pandemic was directly related to our research expertise. Suddenly everyone was interested in how people were using digital media to connect with family, friends, and colleagues. While busy finding our bearings, we also wondered: ‘Should we launch into a study on all this or is it more realistic to focus our energies on coping with the unprecedented situation?’ We were genuinely unsure at first given that we were all facing big unknowns about how to work from home and so much else in our lives. Topics we had been studying for years as communication scholars were suddenly taking centre stage for everybody. It felt like we needed to be part of the conversation. We could not lend a hand in the medical realm, but we could contribute as social scientists to understanding how people were coping. Were people increasing communication with those outside their household, and if yes, using which digital methods? How were people learning about of all of the government rules and health recommendations related to coronavirus? Was everyone experiencing the lockdown similarly or were there differences in how people were adapting? These were just some of the questions we were pondering as we watched lockdowns sweep across the globe. Eventually, our scientific curiosity won out and we launched into constructing the survey. We spent days and nights researching relevant questions, scouring prior scientific literature for appropriate measures, reaching out to dozens of colleagues elsewhere for their input, and eventually testing the full questionnaire to make sure it made sense and was not too arduous for respondents. To coordinate our research team’s collaborative efforts, we relied on some of the same digital tools that we were studying. Fortunately, we had started using Slack years earlier and were thus already used to sharing documents and communicating effectively - even when not in physical proximity. We held lots of video meetings, making sure some of them focused on social catch ups, rather than work, to keep our sanity intact. A few weeks later, working with an online survey firm that helped us reach a diverse sample of Swiss people, we distributed our questionnaire on how people in the country were experiencing the pandemic. All our sleepless nights had been worth it. Rather than wondering about how people were coping, we now had beautiful fresh data. In mid-April, we surveyed 1,350 people in German, French and Italian speaking regions across the 26 cantons of Switzerland. Here are some of the findings. We asked whether communication (voice calls, video calls, text messaging, email, and social media) with friends and family (but not work contacts) had increased, decreased or remained the same compared to before the coronavirus pandemic. More than two-thirds of respondents had stepped up the use of at least one method of communication to keep in touch with those outside their household. Across all modes of communication, the number of people who increased activity greatly outnumbered those who slowed down. The highest activity increases could be observed with video calls, text messages and voice calls. Italian-speakers were most likely to make more use of video calls and social media. Text messaging became more popular among French-speaking participants. Only a small minority of people cut down communication.   Since social media are generally popular for communication (over 95% of participants in this survey use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube), we were curious to see how many people were using them to source information about the pandemic. Overall, 70% of Swiss obtained coronavirus information from at least one of these platforms. There were pronounced differences between language groups, particularly for Instagram and Twitter. Italian-speakers were most reliant on social media as coronavirus information sources. German-speaking respondents were significantly less likely to use WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube. Given that the Federal Office of Public Health uses various media channels to communicate public health recommendations, it is important to know which segments of the population can be reached through the various platforms. Public broadcaster SRF was the most frequently cited source of pandemic information, with 89% of respondents turning to this source at least some of the time. Of the remaining 11%, three-quarters went to social media. This suggests that a diversified communications strategy is the wisest means of reaching the population during times of crisis. People used multiple sources to follow the pandemic. Two-thirds of respondents checked websites for information on both the local and global spreading of the virus - with more than a third of them doing so daily. Interestingly, Italian speakers were much less inclined to keep track of the local situation while German speakers were somewhat less likely to check Web sites about global statistics. About three-quarters of all respondents used purely online news media, although French speakers were considerably less likely to do this than other language groups. In our diverse media ecosystem, most people use multiple channels to keep abreast of pandemic news and information. Indeed, more than half of respondents followed news of the outbreak very closely with an additional 42% following “somewhat closely”. This is encouraging as it suggests that people want to understand the situation. It is also imperative to identify how people educate themselves about the pandemic. This shows government agencies how to reach the population with recommendations as the lockdown measures loosen and social distancing measures change - or in case we ever face such unfortunate circumstances again.
2020-06-19;Switzerland lifts most remaining coronavirus restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-lifts-most-remaining-coronavirus-restrictions/45847950;The Swiss government has announced that it is simplifying and lifting most remaining restrictions introduced to combat the spread of coronavirus, as of June 22. The recommended social distance is being reduced from two to 1.5 metres with immediate effect. From Monday 22, events drawing up to 1,000 people will be allowed (as opposed to 300 at present), provided contact tracing can be guaranteed. Only gatherings of more than 1,000 remain banned until the end of August. Restrictions on when businesses such as bars and restaurants can be open will also be lifted. People will no longer be required to sit down inside. From tomorrow civil and political gatherings and demonstrations will be allowed but people are required to wear masks. The government is also ending its recommendation that people work from home wherever possible. It will be up to employers to decide and put the necessary safety measures in place.  Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga and health minister Alain Berset told a press conference on Friday this was possible because statistics on deaths and new cases were currently good and we are better prepared . But they stressed the need for continued prudence and individual responsibility. Business sectors should now harmonise their protection plans . They are required, for example, to make available soap or disinfectant for hand cleansing,  respect the new social distancing norm, oblige the wearing of masks if this is not possible (for example in night clubs). Ministers also stressed the importance of contact tracing in the case of new infections. The extraordinary situation necessitated by the crisis, which allowed the federal government to take powers normally the domain of the cantons, is now being lifted. Cantons will now be able to take measures according to local situations. The government plans to put the federal coronavirus-related ordinances that are still necessary into a federal law which will go to parliament in September. Sommaruga said the situation had been extremely difficult in March, requiring the federal government to assume extraordinary powers. Now, however, she said the situation is different, with 10-35 new cases par day reported in Switzerland in the past few weeks compared with more than 1,000 in mid-March. Hospitals have shown their ability to cope and have not been overwhelmed as feared. There is more scientific knowledge about the virus, cantons are ready to do contact tracing at their level , and people know to follow hygiene rules such as hand washing, she told the press conference. Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, said the government had always kept its focus on protecting the population and reconciling this with the needs of the economy. Switzerland has chosen a middle ground , without imposing a strict lockdown as in some other countries. But she stressed the need for continued vigilance, the necessity for testing and contact tracing. The Swiss Covid-19 tracing app on mobile phones has an important role to play here, she added. The figures are good, but we are not immune, agreed Berset, pointing to the current situations in the US, Brazil and in China where there has been a new wave of coronavirus cases in recent days.  Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr told the press conference that if there were to be a serious deterioration of the situation, a new extraordinary situation would be possible according to the Constitution.  Meanwhile World Health Organization (WHO) directorgeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the global coronavirus pandemic was accelerating, with Thursday's 150,000 new cases the highest in a single day,  Reuters reported on Friday.  Almost half of the cases reported were from the Americas, he told a virtual briefing. The world is in a new and dangerousphase ... the virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly,and most people are still susceptible.   
2020-06-19;Covid-19 Task Force calls for better data ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-task-force-calls-for-better-data-/45847872;Switzerland needs to improve the speed and quality of its coronavirus data to deal efficiently with a possible second wave of the virus, say government experts.  The country still does not have adequate information on the way the virus spreads, according to the government’s Covid-19 Task Force. Cantons need to coordinate better with the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) to provide a central data bank, but this is currently far from being the case, according to Task Force head Matthias Egger.  Data also needs to be sent more quickly to the FOPH, to allow the pandemic’s development to be tracked in real time, he told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in an interview published on Friday.   Egger said it was also important to conduct genetic analyses of the virus in all infected people. This would allow better tracking of the chains of transmission.  With an effective monitoring system, targeted measures could be put in place in the event of a local resurgence of the disease. Regional authorities could provide accurate information to the affected population or even temporarily close establishments to deal with an outbreak, according to the expert.  Epidemiologist Marcel Tanner, also a member of the Task Force, shares this view. Speaking in a separate interview with newspapers of the Tamedia group, he said that data entry was not fast enough and that some cantons had not committed themselves as much as others or lacked resources.  
2020-06-19;How a Swiss photographer came to capture Haitian weddings;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/how-a-swiss-photographer-came-to-capture-haitian-weddings/45842268;"Setting out from the peaceful western Swiss countryside, photographer Valérie Baeriswyl criss-crossed the world until arriving in Haiti – now she is preparing a book about wedding ceremonies on the Caribbean island. “When I was young, and we were on holidays, we would visit the market, where we would be allowed choose a gift. My sister would ask for a Barbie doll, my brother would get a toy car, and I would get an African mask or a drum – as long as it was something from far away…” Valérie Baeriswyl can’t say why the call of “elsewhere” has always attracted her. As for the camera, “that came when I was around ten years old”. Her father, an avid photographer, used to develop his photos himself. “He taught me how to do it. We would set up camp in the cellar, which often used to annoy my mother, because it was where she did the washing, and our equipment took up lots of space,” Baeriswyl laughs. Then, until the age of 15 – an age at which young girls are often inventing dance moves to go with their favourite songs – she was inviting friends for photo sessions, usually in the countryside around her native Broye region, straddling the cantons of Vaud and Fribourg. Then, one day, the taste for objects from elsewhere became a desire to see this elsewhere – unless she had always been there. “As far back as I can remember, I never had any prejudices or fears of the unknown. I don’t come from a much-travelled family, but I was always very curious. I want to meet people, to see how they live, what they do, what they eat…” At the age of 17, she took off with a friend – destination Bulgaria. “What an idea! Why are you going there? Where is Bulgaria anyway?” they were asked by their friends. Then, after training as a librarian, she left for Peru – “a choice made a bit randomly. I have a Peruvian aunt, who was living there at the time. And so, off I went, without being able to speak Spanish, nor English really.” For five months she made her way through a good part of South America, with a rucksack on her back, without a care for the comfort or the inevitable hardships of these types of low budget trips. She came back with 40 rolls of film ready to be developed. “While I was there, I had written to the local authorities back home in St Aubin to ask about an exhibition of my photos in the castle in the village. Without even knowing what was on the rolls of film, it was quite an audacious request. But Baeriswyl is like that: wilful, optimistic, and hugely generous. “I began exhibiting, quite a lot, in cafés and libraries throughout the region.” On top of this, alongside her job in the library of a secondary school in Lausanne, she also started to cover regional events for local newspapers. And then she began to cover weddings. “No, it’s not corny to do wedding photos. People invite you into their intimate space, it’s an important gesture of trust. Not everyone wants you to be there for the preparation phase, but when I can, I also go there, because the most interesting photos come from these moments. People are natural, there are lots of little details, things to see, it’s precious”. In 2011, at 26, Baeriswyl decided to go professional. To do this, however, a qualification was needed, and she made for Paris, and a photojournalism degree that “taught her how to build a story”. It taught her well: she won a student competition organised by the prestigious Paris Match magazine, for a feature about a French woman who had converted to Islam. Then it was another series of travels: Albania, Central Asia, North Africa, southern Africa. And in 2015, while travelling in the Dominican Republic, that she almost by accident crossed the border into Haiti – one of the poorest parts of the world. Without planning it, she would go on to settle there, only coming back to Switzerland for a few months each summer. It was a massive change. “Sometimes I had the sense I was becoming schizophrenic, since the two [countries] are so different,” she tells swissinfo.ch, from her temporary and comfortable base of her sister’s apartment in the Broye region. “When you see the wealth we have in Switzerland, the facilities we have… We don’t realise that it’s a blessing to be able to go to school, to have a road to get there, to have working hospitals which were able to manage the coronavirus crisis.” “In Haiti, people can’t stay at home all day, because if they want to have something to eat in the evening, they have to go to work to be able to pay for it. Most of them have no savings. They live from an informal economy. There’s no point even thinking about quarantine.” This year, the pandemic forced Baeriswyl home earlier than usual. She was pulled back by the insistence of her family, even if she would have preferred to stay in Port-au-Prince, to document what was happening. Indeed, through her life choices and her work, Baeriswyl is almost an activist. But she is more involved socially; she is not too interested in politics. “To be a photojournalist is to be quite privileged, as an observer, to be able to tell the small story within the larger one. All reportages are not necessarily incredible, but some day, they will be memories for the next stories.” And what is it like to be a white woman in Haiti, a country that is now part of her, and where she now speaks the language? “It’s not always straightforward,” she says. “But most of the time it’s fine. Due to the history of the country, and the damage caused by international interference, some comments here and there about white people or foreigners are inevitable. Often, a joke made in Creole and things become suddenly more friendly.” “Seen in the context of what black people face daily across the world, it’s not a big deal – just look at what’s going on in the news at the moment.”"
2020-06-18;Will Covid-19 push Switzerland into its worst post-war recession?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/will-covid-19-push-switzerland-into-its-worst-post-war-recession-/45844912;"Switzerland’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by around 6% this year. And that’s the best-case scenario. If the Covid-19 pandemic flares up again, the economy could plunge into a crisis even worse than that of the 1970s. Coronavirus dealt a severe blow to the Swiss economy as early as the first quarter of the year, bringing GDP down by 2.6% compared with the previous three months. But containment measures taken since mid-March mean the economic downturn will be even more severe in the second quarter. For the year as a whole, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) expects GDP to fall by 6.2%, while unemployment is expected to hit 3.8% year-on-year (compared with 2.3% in 2019). Slightly more optimistic is the Swiss Economic Centre (KOF), which forecasts a fall in GDP of 5.1%. The government and the cantons have taken a package of measures worth more than CHF60 billion ($63 billion), which should enable the economy to recover in the second half of the year and regain solid growth in 2021. Provided, that is, that there isn’t another major wave of coronavirus cases and that the main export markets for Swiss goods, starting with the EU, the US and Asia, also emerge from the crisis. If this is not the case, GDP could sink by more than 7% this year, according to SECO. This would be the worst contraction since the Second World War. Here is a summary of the main economic crises that have hit Switzerland in recent decades. After two decades of economic and demographic boom, Switzerland was hit hard by the global crisis of the 1970s. This was triggered by political and energy disputes, which led to an explosion in oil prices almost overnight. However, it was also linked to structural factors. In Switzerland, as in many European countries, it marked the decline of the secondary sector, especially heavy industry, and the advent of an increasingly service-based economy. In 1975, Swiss GDP fell by 6.7%, which remains the post-war record. Employment fell by more than 10%, but the number of unemployed remained below 1%; in the absence of compulsory unemployment insurance, hundreds of thousands of foreign workers were forced to leave Switzerland. After sustained growth in the 1980s, with full employment, the following decade was marked by the “long recession”. GDP didn’t plummet but fluctuated between -0.9% and +0.5% for several years. The unemployment rate reached 5.7%, a post-war record. The real estate market went into crisis and banks were forced to take back thousands of properties and bad loans amounting to CHF40 billion. The terrorist attacks in New York in 2001 shook the world economy and created serious uncertainty for investors. The Swiss economy only flirted with recession, but it experienced anaemic growth in the following two years. Between 2001 and 2003, unemployment rose from 1.5% to 4.3%. In order to support the economic recovery, the major central banks, including the Swiss National Bank (SNB), initiated a phase of low interest rates which continues today. In the United States, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy of low interest rates encouraged the formation of a real estate bubble, which burst in 2007. The subprime crisis – mortgage loans granted to insolvent customers – turned into an international financial crisis the following year. In Switzerland, the government and the SNB had to intervene to rescue the largest bank, UBS. In 2009, GDP fell sharply by 2.2%. But Switzerland recovered better than other European countries from this crisis, and almost too well in terms of currency exchange rates: the strength of the Swiss economy in relation to the eurozone pushed up the franc, threatening the export industry. More than ten years later, the SNB still has to focus much of its efforts on combating the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.  "
2020-06-18;Swiss Covid-19 restrictions burdened working women more than men ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-covid-19-restrictions-burdened-working-women-more-than-men-/45830190;The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a greater toll on Swiss women than men when it came to balancing professional and personal responsibilities, according to a new study.  Women generally shouldered a greater share of the childcare and housework burden than men during the lockdown period imposed by the government to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the  Federal Office for Gender Equality said on Thursday.  Between a quarter and a third of the respondents said they experienced a decline in their ability to work due to additional childcare and home-schooling responsibilities. Highly educated professional women, whose activities could be carried out by teleworking, suffered the greatest decline in work productivity.   The studyExternal link carried out by the Sotomo research institute, is based on four successive surveys conducted between 22 March and 8 June. On average, almost 30,000 people participated in each survey.  The measures taken by the government to contain the epidemic have had an impact above all on people with dependent children. Between a quarter and a third of women living with children under the age of 16 experienced a decline in productivity. As in many other countries, women generally took on the additional load on the home front.  The crisis has also had an impact on the atmosphere in households. Approximately one in five people surveyed reported experiencing more tension and conflict at home compared to before the pandemic. 
2020-06-18;Geneva hotel sector feels devastating impact of Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/geneva-hotel-sector-feels-devastating-impact-of-covid-19/45842168;"The coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc in Geneva’s hotel sector, which relies heavily on international visitors and conferences. “We don't deny the impact of Covid-19. We understand that it can put a hotel in the red,” declared Sylvan*, an employee of the five-star Hotel Richemond. “But when the hotel belongs to a multi-millionaire, we cannot understand that we can be made redundant so dramatically without a social plan. We can’t accept that.” He is one of the 141 staff at risk of losing their jobs at the luxury family-run hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva. Most have been on partial unemployment since March. However, at the end of May they learned that the management was considering temporarily closing the hotel to limit the financial damage caused by the pandemic. In April and May its occupancy rates stood at 10%. Fighting to save their jobs, or to at least get a decent redundancy package, staff have contacted a local union and launched a conciliation process. “The case of Richemond is emblematic and will set the tone for how Geneva wants to address the situation of these people,” said Marlene Carvalhosa Barbosa, union secretary at the Interprofessional Workers’ Union. (SIT). “The message I keep hearing, whatever the hotel, is ‘We’re trying to keep your jobs but you must make sacrifices,’” said Barbosa. Her organisation has been inundated with calls during the Covid crisis. During lockdown, hotel staff have been forced to use up holiday allowances and scrap overtime hours. Some were even asked to work when they were declared partially unemployed, she said. An estimated 13,000 out of the 15,000 hotel and restaurant employees in Geneva are said to have been furloughed and put on partial unemployment during the lockdown, receiving 80% of their wages. But surviving on the notoriously low salaries in an expensive city like Geneva is tough. A monthly gross salary for a hotel employee rarely exceeds CHF4,500 ($4,740); most earn around CHF3,400. Nationwide, the hotel industry is predicted to lose CHF1.8 billion in turnover this year due to the pandemic, with overnight stays expected to fall by one third in 2020.   Cities have been hardest hit and Geneva is one of the worst-affected. In recent years it recorded the second highest number of annual overnight hotel stays among Swiss cities. But during the crisis occupancy rates were close to zero; establishments shut and most reservations were cancelled through to June. “It’s a disaster. Geneva is almost exclusively built on business tourism – big congresses, meetings and international organisations and banks – representing around 75% of its overnight stays,” said Thierry Lavalley, general manager of the five-star Grand Hotel Kempinski Geneva. “Today, business is completely paralysed. All the big conferences at the Palexpo congress centre have been cancelled through December 31. Many big international firms have insisted that none of their staff travel until the end of the year. 2020 is over.” Around 300 international meetings and events have been cancelled in Geneva due to Covid, resulting in the loss of millions of francs. Currently, 60 out of 125 hotels in Geneva remain closed. During the peak of the lockdown, 84% of the city’s restaurants and hotels were shut. A recent study of the impact of the Covid crisis on the Swiss tourism industry revealed that each Geneva hotel lost on average CHF1.7 million in income in March and April, and around CHF1 million in May and June – the highest for all Swiss regions. Beyond the loss in turnover, the study warned that the risk of bankruptcies was highest among Geneva-based hotels and restaurants (35% potentially affected). Several hotels have since opened. But according to Lavalley, who is also president of the Geneva Hotel Association, the vast majority have only a handful of clients and occupancy rates for this summer vary between 5-8%. “Many hotels today are operating at a loss,” he declared. On June 15, Switzerland re-opened its borders with many other European states after improvements to the coronavirus situation. For the moment, Switzerland says it is not yet possible to allow travel from outside the European Schengen zone. For example, a visitor from the US or China cannot enter Switzerland. A gradual reopening to other countries may start from July. At Geneva Airport, which has been at a standstill for months, 2,500 passengers flew in on June 15. But at this time of year the daily number of passengers normally fluctuates between 40,000 and 60,000. The airport predicts 70-80% fewer passengers this year compared with 2019. “Things will probably pick up timidly in July and August. The big question is September-November,” said Adrien Genier, chief executive officer of Geneva Tourism. He said Switzerland’s recent ranking as the safest country for Covid-19  was helpful as a marketing tool to attract visitors. But he remains realistic. “Over 80% of people coming to Geneva are foreign visitors and a large number are from the US, Britain and Gulf states, and they are well closed right now,” said Genier. Swiss tourism officials and government ministers are hoping residents will take their holidays in Switzerland this year rather than abroad. But will they choose Geneva over the mountains of Graubünden or Valais? To try to rescue the situation and boost visitor numbers, the Geneva government wants to propose cut-price hotel rooms (1/3 original price) for Swiss residents to stay in the region this summer. The authorities have set aside a budget of CHF4.5million to finance the idea, which must still be validated by parliament. Lavalley welcomes this measure but he remains pessimistic about the future. “The perspectives of economic recovery are very vague. In general the hotel industry is the first to go into crisis but the last to exit. The crisis is not just three months of coronavirus. Its collateral effects are enormous. It will last several months, even years,” he said. And if the Swiss authorities don’t extend partial unemployment measures beyond September for at least 12 months, there will be an economic disaster with everyone on partial unemployment losing their jobs, he added. *name changed to protect anonymity."
2020-06-17;Pandemic sets scene for parliamentary debate on development aid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parlamentsdebatte_pandemic-sets-scene-for-parliamentary-debate-on-development-aid/45831014;"While some say development aid is more important than ever to help offset the global impact of Covid-19, others call for a reallocation of resources to domestic problems. Amid such debates, Switzerland's parliament has given its initial approval to the government’s new aid strategy. The first debate in the House of Representatives, which happened earlier this week, pitted the conservative right Swiss People’s Party against all the other major political parties and groups. Discussions are set to continue in both parliamentary chambers before the bill comes to a final vote later this year. The strategy, which was announced by the government more than a year ago, earmarks a total of CHF11.3 billion ($11.9 billion) for bilateral and multilateral aid cooperation as well as humanitarian aid over the next four years. This is some CHF140 million more than what was allocated for the current four-year period and accounts for 0.46% of Gross National Income (GNI) – the total income earned by Swiss residents, businesses, and earnings from foreign sources. But it falls short of promises made in the past to raise the aid quota to the 0.7% of GNI set by the United Nations. When outlining its strategy more than a year ago, the government announced it wanted to place greater emphasis on Swiss interests, economic growth and the private sector, prompting criticism mainly from the political left and development aid groups. The geographic focus will also be reduced to four regions instead of six: Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe will benefit, while Latin America and East Asia will be gradually phased out – by 2024, for the former. But strong opposition by the People’s Party and some reservations voiced by the left-wing Social Democrats and Greens – as well as the centrist Liberal Greens – did not succeed in derailing the reform during Monday’s debate in the House of RepresentativesExternal link. Support by the centre-right Radicals and the centrist Christian Democrats ensured the bill cleared the first hurdle in parliament. The debate over the planned amount of development aid was also marked by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, both in Switzerland and worldwide. “A stable situation is particularly important for Switzerland whose prosperity depends largely on foreign trade,” said Tiana Angelia Moser of the Liberal Green Party. Her group called for a higher quota of GNI to be spent on development aid. “It is in our own interest, in the interest of Switzerland as a small country – which most likely benefits from globalisation – that we have peace, rule of law and less poverty on this planet,” added Social Democrat Fabian Molina. Several People’s Party parliamentarians, including Roger Köppel, argued that renowned African experts have criticised the very concept of international development aid. His party colleague, Franz Grüter, pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic should lead to a shift in Swiss development aid and called for the rejection of a proposal to raise Swiss contributions. “Many people in our own country fear for their existence and they have serious worries. They lost their jobs [during the pandemic] and face an uncertain future,” he said. Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis warned that the Covid-19 pandemic threatened to undermine the achievements of development over the past few years and that the crisis could prompt a serious economic downturn and social problems for billions of people. “The impact of international cooperation is particularly significant these days,” he said, adding that the government wanted to “spend less than CHF1 per day per Swiss resident” on aid. Alliance SudExternal link, the alliance of Swiss non-governmental development organisations, made no secret of its disappointment about parliament’s unwillingness to boost aid payments to 0.7% of GNI. “The House of Representatives missed an opportunity to send an urgently needed signal for more international solidarity;” a statement said. It called on the Senate, the other parliamentary chamber, to amend the bill later this year and make Switzerland a model for other industrialised countries. Fritz BruggerExternal link, from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, says right-wing opposition is predictable, as development aid is often the first target of spending cuts in times of crisis. “The current situation is an opportunity to seek closer international cooperation,” says the specialist on development economics. Brugger also hopes that the crisis will further a general understanding that sustainable development is only possible through a global approach."
2020-06-17;Campaigners force vote on fighter jet purchase;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/campaigners-force-vote-on-fighter-jet-purchase/45836654; Voters will have the final say on a CHF6 billion ($6.1 billion) package to buy new fighter jets for the Swiss airforce. A committee made up of members of left-wing parties on Wednesday handed in the necessary signatures to trigger a vote on whether to overturn a parliamentary decision taken last December. The pacifist Switzerland Without an Army groupExternal link said it submitted just under 66,000 signatures to the Federal Chancellery. They argue the price for the new jets - to replace the aging fleet of F/A-18 and Tiger aircraft by 2025 - is too high and the money should better be spent on education, public transport and the state old age pension system. “It is an irresponsible purchase and a waste of money,” said Green parliamentarian Marionna Schlatter. However, an alliance including centrist and right-wing parties as well as employers organisations, have dismissed the allegations, saying the new aircraft were needed to ensure Switzerland’s security, freedom and economic prosperity. In 2014, voters rejected a plan to buy 22 Swedish Gripen jets from Saab for CHF3.1 billion, overturning a decision by the Swiss parliament. The government has scheduled the latest vote for September 27 alongside four other issues, including a right-wing proposal to scrap a deal with the European Union on the free movement of people, which has been in force since 2002. The collection of signatures and nationwide votes - a key element of Switzerland’s system of direct democracy - were suspended until the end of May due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
2020-06-16;Certification bottleneck keeps Swiss-made face masks in the warehouse;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/certification-bottleneck-keeps-swiss-made-face-masks-in-the-warehouse/45831082;"The distribution of long-awaited Swiss-made protective face masks, which were funded by the Swiss government and canton Zurich, has been delayed, it has been reported. Production has started but stocks remain in the warehouse as they have not yet been certified. The supply of face masks in Switzerland to cope with the coronavirus pandemic has been an ongoing headache. Initially, pharmacies and suppliers lacked masks and other protective equipment. The Swiss government and canton Zurich joined forces in April and acquired two machines in an attempt to boost local production. The machines should have started producing 64,000 type II surgical masks a day from the end of April. However, on Tuesday Swiss public radio, SRF, reported that the Swiss-made masks are still not available. The two machines reportedly arrived on April 22. It then took six weeks for a team to assemble them at a production site belonging to the firm Flawa at Flawil, canton St Gallen. The production line has only been running since June 2, SRF said. But masks are still not available as they first need to be officially certified to ensure they meet coronavirus protection standards. “As there is no institute in Switzerland that certifies masks, the certificate is issued by the TÜV Nord testing institute in Germany,” a Flawa spokesperson told SRF. “But this is currently overwhelmed with certification applications.” It is unclear when the first masks will start leaving the warehouse and if they will be used by the public. The Swiss government decided not to impose a general obligation for residents to wear face masks as the country began relaxing coronavirus restrictions. A survey in April initially showed a majority of respondents coming out in favour of a mandatory wearing of masks. However, a poll on June 12 revealed that support for the compulsory wearing of a hygiene mask in public appeared to be losing ground. Thirty per cent of those questioned said they should be worn all the time, while 20% said they should be worn part of the time. Another opinion poll published in May found that more than two out of three respondents would prefer masks to be mandatory in trains and buses to protect people against the infectious Covid-19 virus. However, a report on the use of public transport in Switzerland this month showed that only a small minority of people were reportedly wearing face masks on public transport – it is recommended when busy but not obligatory. Post Bus reckons it’s around 5%; the federal railways did not give a number. "
2020-06-16;Swiss economy to suffer worst downturn since 1975;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-economy-to-suffer-worst-downturn-since-1975/45830944;Switzerland's economy is expected to experience its sharpest downturn in decades this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Tuesday. Gross domestic product will drop 6.2% in 2020, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said on TuesdayExternal link, in the worst downturn since 1975. Government economists predict unemployment to rise to 3.8% this year, as foreign trade suffers, consumer spending shrinks and companies emerge slowly from lockdown. The SECO forecast was nonetheless a slight improvement from the 6.7% GDP downturn predicted in April. The government expects a gradual recovery during the second half of 2020 and into 2021 (expected GDP growth 4.9%). But this will depend on numerous factors such as whether there is a second wave of the disease followed by severe restrictions, and assuming that lay-offs and corporate bankruptcies remain limited and that demand from abroad slowly returns to normal levels, SECO said. Government economist Ronald Indergand told Reuters that Switzerland's economy could lose more than $100 billion in output due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. On a per capita basis the downturn is going to be as bad as the mid-1970s, if not worse, said Indergand. It is going to take years to get over this. The economy is only going to get back to its previous level by 2022. Meanwhile, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute at ETH Zurich said on Tuesday that it expects GDP to fall by 5.1%, compared to an earlier forecast of 5.5% (May estimate). It said GDP should increase by 4.3% in 2021, significantly less than an earlier estimation.
2020-06-15;Outgoing Swiss ambassador praises WHO role during pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/outgoing-swiss-ambassador-praises-who-role-during-pandemic/45830538;The impact of the coronavirus pandemic could have been much worse without the World Health Organization (WHO), according to Swiss ambassador Valentin Zellweger. “The WHO did the work we expected of it,” declared the outgoing Swiss ambassador to the United Nations and other international organisations in Geneva in an interview with Keystone-SDA news agency on Monday. Zellweger is due to leave his Geneva post at the end of July after four years to take up a new diplomatic role in Nairobi. He will be replaced by the Swiss ambassador to the UN in New York Jürg Lauber. The diplomat said the pandemic had underscored International Geneva’s central governance role. Geneva is home to the UN’s European headquarters, over 30 international organisations, including the WHO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and hundreds of NGOs. He insisted that no state should distance itself from the multilateral system and reiterated Alpine nation’s support, as “Switzerland depends on others. It’s in our interest”. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised WHO over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak — notably on its alleged “China-centric” stance. The outbreak first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Late last month, Trump said he was “terminating” the US relationship with the WHO. Two years ago, the US withdrew from the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council, which resumed work on June 15. The council is set to hold an urgent debate on Wednesday on allegations of “systemic racism, police brutality and violence against peaceful protests” in the US. When the coronavirus spread in Switzerland in March, the UN and many international agencies closed their doors, asked staff to work from home and cancelled or postponed conferences and meetings. Zellweger insisted that International Geneva had not stopped functioning during the lockdown thanks to online technologies and virtual meetings. “We could not have done without them,” he said. “In the future it will be much easier to associate delegates from far-off countries and regions.” However, he added that negotiations will still require a physical presence, as “compromise solutions are often found in corridors thanks to informal contacts”.           
2020-06-15;Rights Council in Geneva to debate racism and police violence;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/rights-council-in-geneva-to-debate-racism-and-police-violence/45830492;The United Nations Human Rights Council has decided to hold a special debate about racism and police violence. The discussions, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, follow the death of African-American George Floyd at the hands of the police in the United States last month. This sparked worldwide street protests including in Switzerland. The unanimous decision came as the Geneva-based councilExternal link resumed its 43rd session, which had been put on hold three months ago due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the lead up to the session, Burkina Faso called for an urgent debate on racism on behalf of African nations. More than 600 non-governmental organisations also made an appeal for a debate. “The death of George Floyd is unfortunately not an isolated incident,” said Dieudonné Désiré Sougouri, Burkina Faso’s ambassador to the UN. It is only the fifth time in the history of the council that it will discuss the issue of “systemic racism”. Only some delegates were physically present in Geneva on Monday and they had to wear protective face masks as part of Covid-19 health safety regulations. Others participated in the session via remote link. Among the numerous resolutions to be discussed over this week is the launch of a fact-finding mission to Libya to examine human rights violations. Switzerland has sponsored the resolution.
2020-06-14;Women across Switzerland repeat 2019 demand for greater equality;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/women-stage-small-demonstrations-in-parts-of-switzerland/45830186; Hundreds of women demonstrated on Sunday across Switzerland demanding greater equality between the sexes. Last June 14, Swiss women staged historic nationwide demonstrations that mobilised more than half a million people and sparked debates on issues ranging from equal pay to the allocation of childcare responsibilities in society. The main slogans chanted this year by women in Zurich, Bern, Basel, Lausanne and Bellinzona, once again reflected feminist demands. Others focused on environmental issues and racism, which has become global focal point of protests following the death of an African-American man in police custody in the United States. Due to the coronavirus, the demonstrations took place in a decentralised fashion with activities peppered throughout the day. For example, a feminist race was held in the capital, Bern. In Lausanne, women staged their first rally overnight. About 15 topless women demonstrated on one of the footbridges later on Sunday. People chanted solidarity with women around the world. In the southern city of Bellinzona about 200 people paraded through the Old Town before laying out a large mosaic that spelled out the word “Respect”. In Basel, home to major pharmaceutical companies, about 150 demonstrators ended their strike with a dip in the river Rhine at 15:34. That is the average time that, according to statistics on the wage gap with men, marks the end of paid work time for women. Women also turned out to demonstrate in the French-speaking cities of Geneva, which boasted the country's largest crowd with an estimated 2,000 people, and Fribourg in western Switzerland. Purple was again the official color of these female-led gatherings but its use was not as widespread as in 2019. Last year’s protests organised by trade unions came almost three decades after a 1991 strike, when women demanded that a constitutional article on equality of the sexes be translated into concrete legislation. Women say unequal treatment persists, including lower pay, with women on average earning 20% less than men. Discrimination and the difficulty of combining work and family are also issues preoccupying Swiss women.
2020-06-14;Swiss Covid-19 second wave response plan excludes national lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-response_swiss-covid-19-second-wave-response-plan-excludes-national-lockdown/45830184; The Swiss government is against imposing nationwide lockdown restrictions if a second wave of Covid-19 strikes the Alpine nation, according to the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper. The weekend press also took stock of how Switzerland has handled the pandemic overall. Switzerland’s executive body, the Federal Council, is developing a response plan for a second wave scenario that puts emphasis on a regional approach, with cantons leading the way, reports NZZ am Sonntag, a German-language weekly based in Zurich. Cantonal authorities, according to the crisis management concept, would be able to independently order measures such as imposing quarantines to tackle any future upticks in coronavirus infections. This means if an outbreak develops in a region, shops, restaurants, hotels or even entire villages could be confined. The security directors of cantons Bern, Valais and Graubünden confirmed this change of course in remarks to the newspaper. Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset wrote an opinion piece on Saturday in which he argued that Switzerland, notorious for its non-centralised division of power and attachment to consensus building, had managed the crisis as effectively as nations with more centralised systems of governance. At the end of February, we wondered if our institutions would be robust enough to withstand the shock of this pandemic, if our system known for its slowness would be able to face an exponentially growing phenomenon. Today, we have the answer: Switzerland has proven itself , he wrote. Berset’s assessment was published on Saturday in the French-language Le Temps newspaper and the German-language newspapers of the Tamedia group. The Sunday editions of LeTemps and the SonntagsZeitung, however, carried reports claiming that federal authorities initially underestimated the coronavirus crisis on the basis of the minutes of crisis meetings obtained thanks to the Transparency Act. The virus does not spread as easily as the flu virus, so there is a good chance that the situation is under control, Daniel Koch, head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is quoted as saying in a meeting on February 24. That same day, one of his subordinates argued on the contrary that the new coronavirus represented a particular threat to public health and recommended that the government declare the special situation . That warning was ignored. The newspapers also report that, according to the documents, the FOPH had long believed that there was enough material such as personal protective equipment in the country to face the pandemic. They also note that the strategy on wearing of masks – which eventually became a recommendation in settings where social distancing is not possible but not a requirement – also faced internal criticism.
2020-06-14;SoftBank invests in Credit Suisse funds financing technology bets;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/softbank-invests-in-credit-suisse-funds-financing-technology-bets/45830380;SoftBank has quietly poured more than $500m into Credit Suisse investment funds that in turn made big bets on the debt of struggling start-ups backed by the Japanese technology conglomerate’s Vision Fund. SoftBank made the investment into the Swiss bank’s $7.5bn range of supply-chain finance funds, said three people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse touts these funds to professional investors, such as corporate treasurers, as a safe place to park their cash in the short-term debts of seemingly diversified companies. Marketing documents sent to investors show that these funds have ramped up their exposure to several start-ups in the Japanese group’s $100bn Vision Fund over the past year. This has coincided with a disastrous stretch in which $18bn was wiped off the equity value of these technology bets. At the centre of the circular flow of funding is Greensill Capital, a Vision Fund-backed company that says it is “making finance fairer”. The London-based firm, which employs former British prime minister David Cameron as an adviser, selects all of the assets that go into the Credit Suisse funds under an agreement dating back to 2017. The arrangement has allowed SoftBank effectively to provide financial assistance to other Vision Fund companies by paying their suppliers upfront but through a fund commingled with other investors and financing other companies.  This means external investors also bear the risk of these companies failing to pay their debts, which one person familiar with the arrangement said could prove problematic if they are unaware of SoftBank’s substantial interest.  “You thought you were in an arms-length arrangement where all your fellow investors had a pure financial interest,” he said. “Imagine you then found that, in fact, some of your co-investors were funding themselves.” SoftBank, Credit Suisse and Greensill Capital declined to comment. Marketing documents for Credit Suisse’s main supply-chain finance fund show that, at the end of March, four of its top-10 largest exposures were to Vision Fund companies, accounting for 15 per cent of its $5.2bn assets. This included companies hit hard in the coronavirus crisis, such as Indian hotel business Oyo and struggling car subscription start-up Fair. A separate document shows that Santa Monica-based Fair was also the second-largest exposure in Credit Suisse’s “high income” supply-chain finance fund at the end of last year.  In October, the car subscription company’s founder and chief executive resigned shortly after announcing plans to cut 40 per cent of its workforce. Audited accounts for both funds show they had no exposure to Fair at the end of that month, suggesting that they only began financing the company after its difficulties came to the fore. Clients have withdrawn more than $1.5bn from these supply-chain finance funds this year, after a string of Greensill Capital’s clients defaulted on their debts in high-profile corporate collapses and accounting scandals, such as former FTSE 100 company NMC Health. Credit Suisse has told investors that a group of insurers and Greensill itself are covering losses in the funds. Australian financier Lex Greensill founded the company in 2011 and cemented his status as a paper billionaire last year when SoftBank’s Vision Fund invested $1.5bn into his eponymous firm. Greensill Capital specialises in supply-chain finance, where businesses borrow money to pay their suppliers. This week the British Business Bank approved Greensill to provide so-called “invoice finance” through the UK’s Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan scheme. “Making sure capital reaches the real economy, where it is needed most, is integral to Britain’s broader economic recovery,” Mr Greensill said of the decision.

2020-06-14;Did the 2019 women’s strikes give Swiss care workers a boost?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/did-the-2019-women-s-strikes-give-swiss-care-workers-a-boost-/45830124;A massive women's strike took place across Switzerland one year ago. As a gender and diversity expert, I wanted to revisit the core demands of these demonstrations and measure our progress. Are we any closer to achieving equality and valuing our care workers? In 2020 Switzerland, along with the global community, had to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. We are all navigating unprecedented experiences. Some of the questions raised by this crisis are new and shook the pillars of our social lives. Others are long-running issues that have been brought into sharper focus by these cataclysmic events. Back in the summer of 2019, a central demand of the women's strike was that paid and unpaid care work should be much more highly valued. Last June 14, it was argued, as often before, that this appreciation should be reflected in higher salaries and better working conditions in the care sector. The pandemic has highlighted once again the importance of the nursing and extended care professions. Many Swiss people showed their gratitude for these “front line” responders by standing on their balconies and clapping their hands in unison. However, for most people working in the care sector, conditions have deteriorated rather than improved in this time of upheaval. Crisis management meant the extension of working hours in this sector. Personnel shortages were generally offset by placing a greater burden on individuals. And all this took place without raising salaries or offering bonuses in appreciation for all the overtime. In contrast, Switzerland has offered robust support for other sectors experiencing duress: aviation being a prime example. Looking at these socio-political dynamics from a gender perspective, it becomes clear that there has been no improvement in predominantly female occupations such as nursing, childcare and retail. Swiss politicians and society are not (yet) prepared to upgrade paid care work, nor to take compensatory measures through redistribution. These were key demands of last year’s strikes. There are voices that continue to make these demands very clearly. For example, an initiative of the Swiss think tank Denknetz, External linkwith the participation of former Federal Councillor Ruth Dreifuss, is pushing for a a new social contract. It calls for recognising care work as indispensable for a functioning economy, for a more gender-equitable society and for the sustainable use of natural resources. A core element is the material recognition of care work, which can be made possible through a redistribution of resources.  Nevertheless, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga recently spoke out in favour of a discussion on higher wages in so-called systemically important sectors. She called for greater support for employees in care, day-care centers and the retail trade. Sommaruga believes this duty falls on employers, including when the employer is the public sector. In an open letter to parliament, the professional association of nursing professionals demanded higher wages, better working conditions and a strengthening of training. Among other things, they argued in favour of a Covid 19 allowance, as is the case in Germany. Although thesedemands are currently being discussed, they have so far not been implemented or have been implemented inadequately. And what about the demonstrations in the times of coronavirus? If we compare the strike activities of last June and the demonstrations against the restrictive coronavirus measures in April and May 2020, we find some parallels and many differences. One parallel is the longing for a unified community and overcoming separation. The big difference is that coronavirus demonstrators mainly worried their individual demands were not being heard. There was no display of solidarity with a community or group – for example, a shared concern that care work must be upgraded structurally, institutionally and monetarily. Instead, we witness a seemingly desperate demand not to be neglected as an individual. I am fully aware that during such trying times individuals might be inclined to worry about themselves first. The coronavirus health crisis exposed the full extent of our human vulnerability. But it is imperative that we stand solidarity with those who are most at risk. To claim individual rights at the cost of the most vulnerable is frightening and totally incompatible with the objectives of the women’s strike from June 2019.  We, as a society, should take stock of our responsibilities amid this “new normality”. We have a responsibility to care workers and to particularly vulnerable groups. Care work is indispensable to all of us. So it is on us to ensure care workers finally receive the recognition and renumeration they deserve.
2020-06-14;100 Swiss watch brands risk extinction due to coronavirus, expert says;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economy_100-swiss-watch-brands-risk-extinction-due-to-coronavirus--expert-says/45830182; The coronavirus crisis could eliminate up to 100 Swiss watch brands from the market, according to an expert interviewed by the German-language weekly NZZ am Sonntag. Production came to a standstill during the pandemic and the most important export markets collapsed. Whether tourists with purchasing power will return to Switzerland remains in question. The watch industry, notes the newspaper, has been “caught in the perfect storm”. Luxury brands are the exception. They have weathered the storm far better than the rest. Audemars Piguet, Rolex, Patek Philippe or Richard Mille belong to families or foundations that do not focus on driving sales. On the contrary, these luxury brands control their production in a targeted manner, artificially creating shortages in the market. The result: waiting lists for the most sought-after models and buyers who pay steep surcharges to get their dream watch immediately. Even in the coronavirus era, these prices have hardly fallen at all, René Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, told NZZ am Sonntag. On platforms such as Chronext, an unworn Rolex Daytona also cost well over CHF20,000 ($21,000) in the last few weeks instead of CHF12,500.” Other brands are paying the price of unrest in key market Hong Kong in addition to the economic consequences of the pandemic. Exports to Hong Kong collapsed after the outbreak of civil protests in August 2019. In 2020, the pandemic ground production to a halt for several months. Consumer sentiment collapsed and with it global exports. The tourists who typically go home with a Swiss-made watch have yet to show up. Of the approximately 600 watch brands, 50 to 100 will have difficulty surviving this crisis, estimates Weber. Particularly at risk are smaller, independent brands that do not belong to the luxury groups Swatch Group, Richemont or LVMH. The analyst expects watch exports to shrink by 30% in 2020. For sales in Switzerland, he forecasts a 40-50% decline. Watch retailers suffer too The struggles of the Swiss watch makers are reflected in the retail sector. Big players such as Bucherer, Gübelin or Kirchhofer are on solid footing. They have many good years behind them in which to build up reserves, says Weber. But the future looks bleak for smaller boutiques that rely on the hordes of tourists that descend every year on the picturesque lake towns of Lucerne and Interlaken. The small, independent retailers are already suffering from the fact that they can no longer represent the most sought-after brands at all and that they have no online sales platform. And now their clientele is also breaking away,” points out the analyst.
2020-06-14;Anti-racism marches mobilise thousands across Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/george-floyd-blm_anti-racism-marches-spread-across-switzerland/45830136; Black Lives Matter protests mobilised thousands of people across several Swiss cities on Saturday. In Bern, the capital, an unauthorised rally drew some 4,000 people, most of them wearing masks and black attire. Another 10,000 marched In financial hub Zurich. Demonstrators there also donned black clothes and carried banners that read “white silence is violence.” Police initially tried to dissuade them from marching on account of public health restrictions in place to counter the coronavirus pandemic. The march could finally go through on condition that it stayed peaceful, which it did, according to a Keystone-SDA reporter at the scene. In the northeastern city of  St. Gallen, more than a thousand people came together under the banner Black Lives Matter”. Police there said the demonstration unfolded without incident. A similar gathering took place in Lucerne. Switzerland has capped public gatherings at a maximum of 300 people due to the coronavirus pandemic. This is the second weekend in a row that Swiss streets fill with people outraged by the death of African-American George Floyd at the hands of police in the United States on May 26. More than 10,000 people took part in an anti-racism rally held in Geneva on Tuesday, which was organised to coincide with Floyd’s funeral. The fatal incident in the United States has triggered soul-searching on questions of racism and police conduct at home and abroad.
2020-06-13;Homeless in Switzerland during the pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/on-the-margins-_homeless-in-switzerland-during-the-pandemic/45829774;Coronavirus affects businesses, schools, industry - in fact all of us. But what about people on the margins of society? The pandemic has also turned the lives of marginalised people upside down. A report by Klaus Petrus. There are supposedly 400 such vulnerable people in the city of Bern alone. Just as in the rest of Switzerland, no-one knows the exact figures. People without a permanent home, addicts and sex workers are all affected - less by the pandemic, they say, than by the government imposed counter measures. Some cannot stay at home, even if they want to, because they have no home. Spaces at emergency sleeping shelters in Swiss cities have been restricted to comply with federal distancing rules. Only one person is permitted to sleep in a four-bed room and two people in rooms with six beds. As a result, people have been turned away from shelters. Various organisations have weighed in to help. Charities and church associations have provided funds to rent hotel rooms, set up containers and convert buildings to make more beds available. Food services hit Another unwanted side-effect of the government's Covid-19 regulations has been disruptions to food services. For example, the organization “Tischlein deck dich” (“Set Your Table”), which distributes surplus food from supermarkets to 20,000 people every week, had to partially discontinue its service because the safety distance between volunteers and beneficiaries could not be maintained when serving food. Many volunteers were at risk from Covid-19 because of their age. Civil society groups are trying to fill these gaps by offering food in publicly accessible refrigerators or by distributing it in public places. These activities are only possible with financial support. At the end of March, the Catholic Church in canton Bern launched an unprecedented campaign that swiftly provided CHF1 million ($1 million) in emergency aid. Much of the money went to social institutions that help people living in poverty and others on the margins of society. The dwindling services on offer has also affected the daily structure of people’s lives. Social contact has become limited to mixing with others in alleyways. Meeting areas, contact points and street work are significantly restricted. Many homeless people are in the high-risk group, not so much because of their age, but because of their ailing health. Rahel Gall Azmat, director of the addiction support foundation Contact, fears that fewer drugs will be in circulation. “If drugs are scarce, they tend to be stretched thin, and this can have fatal health consequences - in the worst case, overdose deaths.”
2020-06-12;Public transport use still low despite corona easing ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/public-transport-use-still-low-despite-corona-easing-/45830022;"Despite older pupils being allowed back to school last Monday as part of the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, trains and buses remain only half full, transport companies say.  Passenger numbers have increased very gradually, and currently stand at around 55% of normal capacity in regional trains and 45% on intercity trains, Swiss Federal Railways spokesman Frédéric Revaz told the Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA.  At the height of the pandemic, passenger volume dropped by 90%.  Post Bus – the yellow buses seen on many Swiss roads – also said that passenger numbers were well down compared with before the coronavirus crisis, but were slowly picking up.  The only exceptions were tourist routes that were popular during Whitsun and Ascension holidays in May, said spokesman Urs Bloch.  There was also an 80-90% drop in passenger numbers at Post Bus during March and April, the company added. Now the buses are about half full.  Older pupils at non-compulsory schools (age 15-16 onwards) have been allowed back to school since June 8, however many cantons (who are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland) have opted to send pupils back part-time. Younger pupils have been allowed back to school since May 11. Only a small minority of people are wearing protective face masks on public transport – it is recommended when busy but not obligatory in Switzerland. Post Bus reckons it’s around 5%; the federal railways did not give a number.  On Friday, the latest opinion poll carried out by the Sotomo research institute found that only people in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland – bordering northern Italy, a hotbed of Covid-19 in Europe – are strongly in favour of masks on public transport. The French-speaking part of Switzerland also supports this but to a lesser extent.  The German-speaking region is narrowly against the wearing of masks in trains and buses. "
2020-06-12;Unused Covid coffins overwhelm undertakers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/unused-covid-coffins-overwhelm-undertakers/45829920;Many Swiss resorted to panic-buying at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, unsure of what lay ahead. Funeral directors also stocked up – on coffins – and now, because the worst-case scenarios didn’t materialise, they have hundreds of excess caskets on their hands. By March coronavirus had already caused thousands of deaths in Italy and undertakers in Switzerland were also preparing for a possible wave of deaths. Since March they have almost doubled their coffin production rate, according to a report in 20 Minuten. Kurt Dänzer, a funeral director in Fribourg, told Swiss public radio, SRF, that 100 coffins were piled up in the company’s warehouse instead of the usual 60. Huguenin Burials, which runs a funeral service around Bern and Solothurn, has the same problem. 20 Minuten reported in April that the company had prepared for the pandemic by ordering 400 coffins, saying it obviously hoped they wouldn’t all be needed but it was important to be prepared. “This is very unusual. Normally we only have about 40 coffins in stock,” said CEO Kevin Huguenin. Managing these is almost impossible, according to undertaker and coffin maker Beni Hochuli in Bern. “You need a whole gymnasium to store them.” Hochuli says that at the beginning of the pandemic he too felt the increased demand for coffins. He believes that some companies bought up hundreds as a panic reaction. “Even back then I found this ‘hamstering’ a bit exaggerated.” But he stocked up as well, albeit minimally. “I have the advantage of being able to produce the coffins myself in an emergency,” he pointed out. But he says the pandemic hasn’t had a great impact on his business. “I’ve had to deal with two cases of coronavirus in all. To be honest, I didn’t expect much more than that.” 
2020-06-12;Swiss Covid-19 fundraising totals CHF40 million ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-covid-19-fundraising-totals-chf40-million-/45829598; The national charity, Swiss Solidarity, says it has collected almost CHF40 million ($42 million) to help vulnerable people in Switzerland affected by the coronavirus crisis.  The sum has been collected since a national fundraising day on March 23. So far, CHF23.3 million has been handed out to aid projects, a statement said on Friday.  Although the government has progressively relaxed the anti-virus lockdown measures, many people have still not been able to return to their normal lives, the organisation wrote. “Many are still suffering from the social and economic effects of the crisis,” it said.   In all, 103 organisations have received financial support from Swiss Solidarity, which is the humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, swissinfo.ch’s parent company.   Projects included food deliveries, transport and home help for the elderly and the disabled, as well as financial aid for those in need. “There was also help for people who have suffered in particular from a loss of income and in some cases don’t even have enough money to buy enough food,” the statement said.  Aid had been distributed efficiently and effectively, despite the larger than normal demand, which has pushed some organisations to their limits, Swiss Solidarity added.  But many also experienced “a great solidarity” from the Swiss public, with people volunteering and restaurants preparing meals. 
2020-06-12;Without foreign visitors, Switzerland’s summer tourism season looks gloomy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-impact_without-foreign-visitors--switzerland-s-summer-tourism-season-looks-gloomy/45829078;"As coronavirus travel restrictions keep many foreign tourists away, Swiss tour operators are coming up with creative ways to attract local visitors this summer. But it is unlikely to make up for the revenue losses. Japanese tourists taking selfies on the Jungfraujoch; Indian families admiring the panoramic views from the Montreux-Bernese mountain train ride; American rock climbers carrying ropes and pitons along Lucerne’s Schwanenplatz. Scenes like these will be missing in Switzerland this summer. With borders closed around the world and most air traffic at a standstill, the tourism sector is suffering under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), the impact of the pandemic could see the number of international tourists this year decline 60% to 80%; a fall never seen before in the 70 years since records were first kept in 1950. Switzerland will be no exception. The opening of borders within the European Union and with the United Kingdom on June 15 will certainly bring some relief to tourist operators but will not be enough to save the tourist season. “The effects in the short term are already terrible,” says Véronique Kanel, spokesperson for Swiss Tourism, the organisation responsible for promoting Switzerland’s tourism industry. “And the forecasts for summer remain very cautious, with an occupancy rate of 24% for the hotel sector and 42% for other holiday accomodation.” According to a study by HES-SO Valais institute, Swiss tourism could lose up to CHF8.7 billion ($9.2 billion) in 2020, pushing almost a quarter of businesses to the brink of bankruptcy. The impact is expected to vary from region to region across the country. Deserted in the spring with the decline in business travel and conference cancellations, cities like Lucerne, Geneva and Zurich have been especially hard hit. Overnight stays are expected to fall by almost 50% in cities this summer, versus 20% to 30% for the Alpine regions, according to forecasts by the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF). The Alpine regions — with the exception of popular destinations like Interlaken and Zermatt — are normally less dependent on foreign tourism than city centres. With virus fears and social distancing in place, even more Swiss are expected to forego holiday plans abroad. They are also likely to spend their summer holidays in mountain pastures rather than densely populated city centres. In summer more than winter, Switzerland is heavily dependent on international visitors, which account for more than half of recorded overnight stays. Despite campaigns launched by local authorities to encourage local travel this summer, clients from Switzerland and neighbouring countries will not be enough to compensate for the lack of foreign travellers. “Even if there are fewer of them than Europeans, these [non-European] tourists spend the most money during their trips to Switzerland,” comments Nicolas Délétroz, professor at HES-SO Valais’ Institute of Tourism. It is not only the hotels, restaurants and transport that will suffer from the absence of these guests. In Lucerne, watch stores generate almost 90% of their revenues from tour group travellers, largely from China. In Geneva, tourists from the Middle East will be sorely missing from the luxury hotels and boutiques during the month of August, a period when the shores of Lake Geneva are particularly attractive to this wealthy clientele. The experts do not expect non-European tourists to return before 2021. And it will take more time for the sector to return to 2018 levels of activity. “Swiss tourism will suffer the effects of the coronavirus pandemic for a long time. If everything goes well, it is likely that a return to normal will not occur before 2023 or 2024,” says Kanel. For Délétroz, the rhythm and scale of the return of overseas tourists depends largely on the rebound of international air traffic. “I don’t really believe that human behaviour will change automatically. However, a marked increase in the price of airline tickets could have a decisive influence on intercontinental tourism,” he says. Already, we can see the progression of continental tourism. “That is notably the case in the Asia Pacific region. The Japanese are not necessarily going to go to Europe or the United States for their holidays, they will prefer to travel in other Asian countries or Oceania,” he says. That said, Switzerland will always be positioned high up on the bucket list of faraway travel destinations. “We could very well imagine that, sooner or later, taking a seaside holiday on the other side of the world could become obsolete. But for many Asian tourists, Switzerland will certainly remain a country that one has to visit at least once in their lifetime,” says Délétroz. "

Already, we can see the progression of continental tourism. “That is notably the case in the Asia Pacific region. The Japanese are not necessarily going to go to Europe or the United States for their holidays, they will prefer to travel in other Asian countries or Oceania,” he says. That said, Switzerland will always be positioned high up on the bucket list of faraway travel destinations. “We could very well imagine that, sooner or later, taking a seaside holiday on the other side of the world could become obsolete. But for many Asian tourists, Switzerland will certainly remain a country that one has to visit at least once in their lifetime,” says Délétroz. "
2020-06-11;A death blow or a new lease on life for the responsible business initiative?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/is-the-swiss-parliament-s-decision-a-death-blow-or-a-new-lease-on-life-for-the-responsible-business-initiative-/45829262;Years of back and forth on imposing legal accountability for companies overseas have come to an anticlimactic end in parliament. For campaigners on both sides of the initiative though, it is just the beginning. This week the Swiss parliament finally agreed on a counter-proposal to the highly contested responsible business initiative. After more than four years of debate, one would think a compromise would be cause for celebration. However, the compromise is far from what campaigners of the initiative had in mind. As my colleague Andrea Tognina reports, the legal liability clause – the big bone of contention – was removed. The requirements on due diligence were also whittled downExternal link to such an extent that it would hardly push big companies beyond what most are already doing. Campaigners for the initiative plan to bring the initiative to the people for a vote this fall or early 2021. But the vote won’t be a zero-sum game, meaning that a vote against the initiative means parliament’s milder form would still go forward. Is this a good consolation prize for campaigners or simply a safe escape route for the opposition? Could this doom the initiative or breathe new life into it? The initiative promoters have said the compromise is a fig leaf and argued that it will do little to hold companies accountable for their actions. Instead, they’ll publish glossy brochures once a year. Either way, the battle for public opinion is heating up and it will get more difficult for multinationals to hide behind industry lobbies. Both sides have already started tallying up supporters among business executives and entrepreneurs. On one side you have executives supporting the Economic Committee for Responsible CompaniesExternal link and on the other sideExternal link, those warning of the initiative’s potential damage. Still, many of the biggest companies have been reluctant to attach their name to any one side, at least publiclyExternal link. What do you think of the prospects for the initiative? How do you see the campaign heating up where you are? I want to hear from you: jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch. Chocolate is increasingly coming from illegal cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. An investigative report by the NZZ paper uncovered a deep web of corrupt intermediaries, children with machetes and exploitation in protected forests, all despite corporate and government commitments to eliminate all of the above. According to the report, every sixth chocolate bar has its origins in the nature reservesExternal link in the Ivory Coast and the situation is getting worse. Chocolate manufacturers like Barry Callebaut don’t know the origins of much of their cocoa and as one intermediary in the article says, if you don't know where the beans come from, you know that they often come from the wrong place” Employees at Richemont are crying foul over salaries. As the Le Temps paper reports, workers at the luxury group are frustrated by the CHF41 million executives raked in last year. The company’s announcement that executive committee salaries were up by more than 35% coincided with news that employee bonuses would be slashedExternal link, leading some workers to go on strike in parts of Italy. A day after the story broke, the company reacted saying it came down to bad timing and poor communication. Since April, salaries of the executive committee have all been cut to compensateExternal link for the impact of the coronavirus. A battle between principles and pragmatism is playing out around palm oil. Left-wing farmer unions are collecting signatures for an initiative to remove palm oilExternal link from a recently signed free trade agreement with Indonesia. However, according to the Tages-Anzeiger, politicians on the left are divided as to whether such a move would actually improve the situation. The trade deal includes requirements on sustainable production for the first time, which some say could set the bar for other free trade agreements.

2020-06-11;Pandemic points the way to sustainable agriculture;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-points-the-way-to-sustainable-agriculture/45826016;The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted many weaknesses in our global food system and could present a unique window for reform. The way forward involves a combination of natural, artificial and high-tech approaches, according to leading agriculture and consumer experts. “What we learn from the shock of the pandemic is that we are already sitting deeply in a broken food system,” said David Bosshart of the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI) for economic and social studies, based near Zurich. The global lockdown caused significant disruption to food supply chains on an international and local level, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Restrictions on movement curbed farmers’ access to markets to buy animal feed, seeds and fertiliser, and to sell products. The breakdown in transport systems led to the dumping of perishable food and dramatic price reductions at the farm gate. In Switzerland, the hotel, restaurant and catering sector vanished overnight, along with farmers’ markets for fresh produce, cutting small suppliers off from their customers. With migrant agricultural workers unable to travel, fresh produce accumulated at farms from Bangladesh to the United States. Meanwhile slaughterhouses were operating at reduced capacity and meat-processing plants everywhere became hotspots for Covid-19 infection. In an online discussion on the future of food organised by the GDI, Bosshart explained that our current system was on the wrong track. This is especially worrying because the system must constantly increase output to feed a growing global population. By 2050, it is estimated that we will need to increase the volume of food production by 50%. Continuing on the current track means “forests and savannahs will be stripped and repurposed into arable land, ecosystems will be lost and intensive monoculture farming techniques will degrade more land,” he said. A third of agricultural land is already degraded. Aside from negative consequences for the environment, such a heavy agricultural impact on the natural world increases the risk of disease transfer from wildlife to livestock and from animals to people. There is strong evidence that the novel coronavirus responsible for the current global pandemic originated in bats and passed through an intermediate species to humans. To achieve a cleaner agricultural system, a major part of the solution is for humans to change our eating habits, Bosshart said. It is time to move away from animal-based protein, which currently provides a third of protein consumed globally while generating 14.5% of man-made greenhouse gases. Substitutes for animal-based proteins include plant proteins, cultured meats and fermented proteins. Contributing to the GDI discussion from Israel, Tammy Meiron of the food-tech start-up incubator Fresh Start discussed progress in the development of cultured meats, which can be grown from tissue samples in a bioreactor. “These technologies have not yet overcome the challenge of scaling up and being affordable, but it will reach this point because the need is very strong and the capabilities are there,” she said. “We will begin with hybrid products, combining plant-based proteins with cultured meat proteins.” Meiron estimated that these products would be widely accepted within ten years. “But I believe that we will see the first pioneering products in the market in the next three to five years on a small scale.” The pandemic has also highlighted the need for less-globalised food supply chains, particularly as the global urban population continues to grow. By 2050, an estimated 68% of people will live in cities, up from 55% in 2016. Urs Niggli of the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture addressed this issue in the discussion and said that megacities like Mexico City or Istanbul, with more than ten million inhabitants, are particularly vulnerable. Producing food in cities instead of importing it from rural areas is one way for them to become more independent. Niggli sees two trends in urban food production: urban gardening carried out by individual citizens, and high-tech covered sites. “The potential is that 5% to 10% of all food in the future will be produced in cities,” he said. “We are able to produce excellent food under completely artificial conditions. We will see many production halls in industrial buildings and on roofs, but we will also see many gardens in empty areas where food is produced in an organic way.” But he noted that farmers and food processors would still be the main suppliers and they must participate in the search for greener solutions, along with scientists whose expertise is scattered in different disciplines. “We have excellent knowledge, but we’re not really able to optimise sustainable farming systems because that requires an understanding of the systemic context,” he said of the scientific community. There will be a place for animals in sustainable farming in the future, Niggli said, but certain changes are inevitable, including higher prices for meat. A third of the world’s grain currently goes to feed livestock, mainly chicken and pigs, but this will not be viable indefinitely on such a huge scale. An estimated 50 billion chickens are slaughtered for food each year, as are almost 1.5 billion pigs.   “One day we might come to a solution where we use our food waste to feed chickens and pigs so we won’t lose that [sector] totally, but it will be strongly reduced because there is competition between humans and these animals for cereals,” he said. The issue of food waste has also come to the fore during the pandemic with animals having to be slaughtered for nothing and rotting produce left unharvested in the field. The Federal Office for the Environment has calculated that, in normal times, food consumption in Switzerland generates 2.8 million tonnes of avoidable food waste a year at all stages of the food chain, both in Switzerland and abroad. “Please don’t let us waste this crisis,” Bosshart said. “There won’t be a new normal because the old normal was a bad normal. We cannot have healthy people living on an unhealthy planet carrying out inappropriate food production.” 
2020-06-10;Swiss forests are healthy but need better management;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/forests-switzerland-sustainability/45826920;Despite threats such as drought and insects, Swiss forests are better equipped to handle natural hazards than they were a decade ago. There’s also more diversity in terms of the types of trees found in Swiss woodlands, according to the forest inventory report presented on Wednesday. Detailed monitoring since 1983 has helped the Swiss authorities evaluate the condition and development of the nation’s forests, which cover about a third of the country. The latest inventory, the fourth of its kind, is based on research conducted from 2009-2017. It’s the joint effort of the federal environment office (FOEN) and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL). “The development of Swiss forests since the first inventory is generally a success story, despite major damage due to natural events,” noted Urs-Beat Brändli, senior scientist at WSL. “Over the past eight years, forest management has become more sustainable in many areas. But there are some problematic issues like intense wildlife browsing and the partial inaccessibility of mountain woodlands.” The inventory, completed via samples across the country, registered growth in terms of the variety of tree species as well as the overall area of Swiss forests. Between 2009 and 2017, Switzerland gained 15 football pitches’ worth of forest per day, thanks mainly to alpine meadows returning to their original forest state. Yet fewer than half of the mountain forests are easily accessible for wood harvesting. This makes it difficult and expensive to maintain them, and as their trees grow taller and thicker, young trees struggle to establish themselves. At the same time, deer and other animals feast on young oaks and white fir trees, both valuable species in forests that protect roads and settlements from landslides and avalanches. According to the inventory, some 42% of Swiss forest land plays this protective role. Having a mix of tree species and ages helps forests in general to survive storms, pests and climate change. Hotter and drier phases put a severe strain on trees, making them more vulnerable to severe weather, diseases as well as insects like the bark beetle. “Structurally, Swiss forests are adapting to climate change,” said Michael Reinhard, head of FOEN’s forest division. For example, there are more mixed-species forests in the midlands. “This development must continue through consistent measures, with the government providing financial support to forest owners.” But not all new trees are welcome: invasive species, such as the cherry laurel and Chinese windmill palm, remain a concern. In recent years there has been an increase in forest planning as well as in the amount of certified woodland. But the inventory found that 21% of Swiss forests are unmanaged, representing an “undesirable” development. Despite the surplus local supply, cheaper imported wood remains attractive. Swiss forests are also a popular destination for leisure activities, as seen especially during the coronavirus lockdown. And while littering is an issue throughout Switzerland, the forest inventory noted a decrease in the amount of rubbish being dumped in Swiss woods. With so many demands on forests – as well as potential threats – how do foresters go forward? “It’s a challenge for foresters to find the right path for the future. When’s the next big storm? When will the bark beetles come back? That’s why we need forests with a certain resilience, that can adapt to different situations,” said WSL Deputy Director Christoph Hegg, highlighting the importance of having a variety of trees to maintain a healthy forest. “But the forest doesn’t need people. The forest will survive anyhow.” The next Swiss forest inventory is already in the works.
2020-06-10;OECD forecasts drop in Swiss economic growth in 2020 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/oecd-forecasts-drop-in-swiss-economic-growth-for-2020-/45826934; Even though restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19 were less strict than in other countries, Switzerland will still see its GDP fall by 7.7%, if the pandemic is contained by summer. Gross domestic product will not rebound until 2021, according to the forecast published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on Wednesday. Despite a shorter lockdown period than other countries, household consumption and investments have collapsed, the Paris-based organisation said. Private spending is expected to fall by 6.8% in 2020 and rebound by nearly as much in 2021. The OECD predicts exports will bear the brunt of a slow economic recovery and the appreciation of the Swiss franc. It forecasts a drop of 7.6% in exports in 2020 and a rebound of 4.2% next year. A second wave of the coronavirus, however, could spell even more trouble for the economy, with an increased risk of bankruptcies, job losses and lower investment. In such a scenario, GDP could fall by 10% in 2020 and recover by only 2.3% in 2021, the OECD said. However, the country’s low level of public debt provides fiscal leverage for authorities to support companies, especially small and medium-sized firms, which have been severely affected by Covid-related closures, it added. Many businesses have been able to re-open their doors beginning in May, after the federal government eased restrictions.
2020-06-10;Switzerland named safest country for Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-safest-country-covid-19-coronavirus-ranking/45820836;A global ranking comparing how nations cope with coronavirus finds that Switzerland is the safest place to be. Switzerland ranks first for its economic resilience and its careful approach towards relaxing “lockdown and economic freezing mandates in a fact- and science-based manner, without sacrificing public health and safety”, states Deep Knowledge Group in its Covid-19 Regional Safety Assessment. The ranking, published last week, takes into account factors such as monitoring and detection capacity, quarantine and government efficiency, and healthcare and emergency readiness. Altogether the analysis includes 130 qualitative and quantitative parameters. The 250-page report is based on 500 data sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Johns Hopkins University, Worldometers and the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Switzerland has been one of the countries most affected by the virus in Europe. Officially, a total of 30,934 people have been infected and 1,923 have died due to Covid, out of a population of 8.5 million. Since April 27, the country has been gradually loosening strict virus-related restrictions. In mid-April, Israel and Germany held the top two slots, while Switzerland ranked 11th. “In our previous safety and risk assessment, regions which had very high levels of emergency preparedness and a capacity to efficiently manage national crises achieved the highest score because they had the greatest likelihood of managing the early stages of the pandemic,” explain the authors. In the meantime, they’ve taken a closer look at national tactics for relaxing lockdown measures and withstanding economic fallout – areas where Switzerland is especially strong. “The government’s efficiency in managing economic risks is considerably high. The region has financially assisted companies and citizens with greater vulnerabilities to cushion the effects of the economic crisis, and as a consequence, the unemployment crisis has been controlled more efficiently in this region than in most of those considered in this report,” note the authors. Other strengths include “guaranteed accessibility to high standard healthcare services for the entire community” and “large capacities to mobilize new health resources”. Despite topping the overall ranking, Switzerland could still improve a great deal. “The main weakness of the Swiss program has been the determination to test only citizens with mild symptoms, when the most dangerous vectors are those who are asymptomatic,” it warned. Switzerland must also establish coherent programmes for the monitoring, detection and neutralisation of new cases as potential outbreaks occur in the months ahead, it said. The decentralised Swiss health system could prove a challenge in this respect, it added. Indeed, the crisis is far from over, warns the report. “Switzerland has proven to be a fundamental actor in the fight against Covid-19 and its management scheme a model to keep in view, but it is important that the reopening process of the Swiss economy is carried out with caution, assessing the dynamics of the virus, otherwise all the sacrifice and joint work of citizens, government and organizations will have been meaningless,” wrote the authors. Deep Knowledge Group is a consortium of commercial and non-profit organisations based in Hong Kong. It will continue to update the rankings. 
2020-06-09;Swiss to pioneer use of coronavirus tracing app in Europe;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-to-pioneer-use-of-coronavirus-tracing-app-in-europe/45823496;Parliament has given the green light for the public launch of SwissCovid, a contact tracing application to help contain the coronavirus pandemic.  On Monday, the House of Representatives followed the Senate in approving a law setting the legal basis for the app, which will use Bluetooth waves to allow smartphones to communicate with each other anonymously.  The DP-3T system was developed by the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne with expertise from the US technology giants Google and Apple.  The app stores users’ smartphone data for 21 days, allowing them to be notified if they have come into close contact with infected people.  The use of SwissCovid is voluntary and the data collected is stored on decentralised servers, some operated by the state, as well as some by Amazon Web Services in Germany.  It is expected the app will be made available to the general public at the end of June, serving as a tool to prevent a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections in the country.  Switzerland has so far reported about 31,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 1,660 deaths related to Covid-19, but the government has gradually eased sweeping restrictions on public life as the number of new cases has fallen sharply.  The app is part of the health authorities’ strategy to trace all infections, isolating patients and quarantining people who are at risk after having come into close contact with an infected person – that is, within a distance of less than two metres over a period of at least 15 minutes.  People who are notified by the app are asked to consult an information service to receive advice on how to seek medical treatment and how to protect others from infection.  The cantonal authorities continue to track all reported cases of coronavirus.  Patients are contacted via phone in a bid to identify and find all people who may also have been infected. They are asked to go into quarantine and consult a doctor if they develop symptoms and they need medical care.  Criticism of the app came mainly from some members of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party during Monday’s debate in the House of Representatives.  Thomas de Courten warned against a system of state surveillance that would compromise privacy, saying it reminded him of George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose portfolio includes health issues, tried to dispel such concern, saying the use of the SwissCovid app was voluntary.  Experts hope that at least 60% of the population will install the app on their mobile phones to yield a critical mass of data.  People who test positive for Covid-19 have to stay at home and are eligible for financial benefits as a result of absence from work, Berset explained.  Currently about 60,000 people in Switzerland are using the SwissCovid app on a trial basis and feedback has been mostly positive, he added.  The government initially planned to introduce the tracing device without creating a legal basis regulating the details, including access to free tests for a person who receives a notification on the app. However, parliament last month insisted on a regular legislative procedure.
2020-06-08;US withdrawal from the WHO ‘hasn’t been fully thought through’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/global-health_us-withdrawal-from-the-who--hasn-t-been-fully-thought-through-/45820376;"US President Donald Trump says he wants to end his country’s relationship with the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO). Global health specialist Ilona Kickbusch explains the implications and what could happen next. The American president said late last month that he is “terminating” the US relationship with the specialised UN health agency. He accuses the WHO of becoming a puppet of China during the global coronavirus crisis and of failing to make the reforms to the organisation that he had demanded in a May 18 letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.swissinfo.ch: Can the US unilaterally withdraw from the WHO, which it helped found in 1948?Ilona Kickbusch: When it joined the WHO, the US was the only country with a special clause allowing it to withdraw. This was a legal construct agreed by the US Congress. If Trump goes down that road, he would have to formally notify the WHO that the US wants to leave. It would still be part of the organisation for one year and it would still have to pay all any outstanding assessed contributions. [At the time of writing Washington has not yet sent a formal notice of withdrawal.] swissinfo.ch: But there are still many unanswered questions. Trump did not say exactly how, when or on what terms the US would leave the WHO. Do you think the president is intending a full withdrawal, or something less dramatic, such as a halt in funding and co-operation? I.K.: There is a lot of over-interpretation going on right now. Trump is basically saying, ‘I don't want to work with these guys anymore, as I don't trust them’. Does he want to do what he did with UNESCO, that is, to withdraw according to the rules? Or does he want to let the US WHO membership rest, which is possible, until the US feels, according to their interpretation, that the WHO has got its act together? This happened between the USSR and WHO in the 1950s. A third option might be something none of us are creative enough to think about right now as there is so much negotiation, talk and concern. Then, if Trump sends the letter now and doesn't win the November election, the next US president might simply say he doesn't want to withdraw. Also, what we don't quite know is whether Trump can unilaterally decide this or if he actually needs agreement from Congress. swissinfo.ch: What are some of the possible implications of a US withdrawal from the global health agency? I.K.: Does withdrawing from WHO also mean withdrawing from treaties like the International Health Regulations and the International Framework Convention on Tobacco Control? Some of these treaties are very important for the US. Does it mean withdrawing from all global health cooperation like the global polio programme, where a lot of the voluntary US money goes? Will they pull out seconded US staff from the WHO and what does that mean for their families? What is the overall timeframe?  The devil is in the detail. It's really, really complicated. Withdrawing from UNESCO was easy, as there were no treaties involved. But when you withdraw from the WHO you have a range of health treaties and norms and standards, where American institutes and researchers and experts play an incredibly important role. This decision hasn't been fully thought through. Trump probably thinks the WHO is a Geneva-based organisation full of strange bureaucrats. But WHO also has 80 country offices that the US uses all the time for bilateral programmes. WHO also has regional offices. What will the implications be for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)?  What about all the work the WHO does in Latin America which is becoming the foci of the pandemic? The implications of this will be difficult for both sides. The world needs US expertise and science and vice-versa. Even when the US works bilaterally in countries, the WHO is the most trusted partner; if you want to do significant health work you have to be seen to be working with the WHO. swissinfo.ch: The US is the WHO’s biggest donor. Will the agency have problems filling the gap?I.K.: In terms of assessed WHO contributions [dues countries pay in order to be a WHO member], I'm sure that countries will fill that up. But in the medium and long-term, there must be discussions on how to approach the issue of assessed contributions. It hasn't been good for one country to bear such a large chunk of WHO funding, as it distorts power relations.  Also, if the withdrawal does happen, for voluntary funding I would speculate that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would fill the gap in the polio programme, for example.  swissinfo.ch: Could Trump’s move bring about a shift in global health governance with smaller states and alliances playing a greater role at the WHO? I.K:  It’s something that's happened slowly and surely. The EU has got its act together better. The recent World Health Assembly resolution on Covid was very significantly negotiated by the EU. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is a doctor and committed to global health. You have the German presidency of the EU starting in July; they have been one of the most adamant supporters of the WHO. Then you have Asian countries coming together and the African Union playing a much stronger role. Also, smaller countries, like Switzerland and Austria, are starting new alliances. We are seeing incredible dynamics right now. A lot of American commentators are too simplistic: the US leaves WHO and China takes over... no, that's not the scenario I’m seeing. "
2020-06-08;How one Swiss university in a hard-hit region coped with Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/studying-in-ticino_how-a-swiss-university-has-coped-with-covid-19/45806502; As coronavirus cases rapidly spread, southern Switzerland’s Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) found new ways of working and supporting those affected by the crisis. Now it is preparing for a slow re-opening. “It has been a lot of work, and hasn’t been easy,” said Boas Erez, the USI's rector, on adapting to the new situation imposed by the pandemic. But by pulling together, the university community stayed true to its mission through the emergency, he told swissinfo.ch. It has been particularly difficult for the 1,455 Italian students and members of staff (a third of the faculty) whose country of origin has suffered a particularly devastating coronavirus outbreak. Many students returned home to their families as the situation became more serious, attending lectures from home. “Some have been affected directly by the consequences of the virus, and more than anything, our sympathy goes out to them,” Erez said. Switzerland ordered universities to stop on-site teaching from March 16, as part of measures to contain the coronavirus. Universities may now re-open for students from June 8, but most will continue with distance learning until the end of the spring semester. In many cases, summer exams will be taken online and graduations held virtually. This is also the case at the USI (it finished the semester on May 29, but there will be exams in June/July). The USI introduced its coronavirus measures progressively, while constantly monitoring the situation in neighbouring Lombardy – sometimes acting before decisions taken at a Swiss national level, Erez said. On March 8, for example, the university announced that it would limit access on two campuses for those coming from Covid-19 “red zones” in northern Italy (e-learning was offered instead). From March 12, the university closed down for teaching completely. Scientific research continued, like elsewhere, under special conditions. The university’s total switch to online learning was aided by the fact that it has an eLab, which promotes e-learning among students and staff, Erez said. No course days were lost. There were other changes: the Dies Academicus university celebration day, graduation ceremonies and even a tour for potential Masters students were held online for the first time. “My work was profoundly affected by the crisis,” said Lorenzo Cantoni, director of the Institute of Digital Technologies for Communication, and pro-rector for Education and Students’ Experience. “Two courses taught jointly with colleagues changed from face-to-face to online, after several days of a mixed approach with some students on campus and others working remotely. While some content was ready, we had to produce a lot of new content, such as video lessons and online meetings with students,” he said. Working from home was a particular challenge: “I often worked very early in the morning to record the video lessons, before my children got up, so I could record without any noise. During work hours, I then had to ‘compete’ for the internet connection with my wife and children, as we were all using the connection for work or studies.” Keeping in contact with students, especially those having a tough time personally, has also been key. “It was very important to reassure them and help them not to lose faith and their enthusiasm for their studies,” Cantoni said via email. The university also offered a solidarity scholarship fundExternal link to those impacted by the pandemic. + Swiss student finances affected by coronavirus lockdown For Yassin Ndiaye, a student taking a Bachelors in Italian language, literature and civilization, maintaining a balanced studying routine was one of the biggest challenges of the lockdown. It was not as easy to maintain her concentration and organisation as before, she said. “Being at home for such a long time made me realise the importance of human contact and exchanging ideas, things you normally take for granted,” she said via email. As her student year representative, Ndiaye found her herself in a key role as an intermediary between students and lecturers. Her class maintained solidarity during the coronavirus crisis, she said, with lecturers working hard to make distance lessons “as normal as possible”. With the coronavirus situation easing in Switzerland, thoughts are now turning to the future – some staff have already been allowed back on campus under special conditions and the USI is to announce its measures for the autumn semester on June 16 –  and what might change for university life. For rector Erez, e-learning is the most evident example, especially now that everyone at the school (not just a minority) has tried it. Working from home, online conferences and events and new digital formats were also other areas to explore. What might have been done better: a little more previous investment in digital content, he says. Cantoni and Ndiaye are looking forward to getting back to campus one day. In research, it’s the informal contact like the chat at the coffee machine or the quick visit to your colleague’s office for an update that are important as well as the formal contact like meetings, Cantoni points out. “I miss all of this, and I hope we can soon return to normality,” he said, “even if it is a slightly different one that guarantees social distancing and, if necessary, the possibility of going back online.”
2020-06-07;Jump in cyber attacks during Covid-19 confinement;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/jump-in-cyber-attacks-during-covid-19-confinement/45818794;The number of cyber attacks reported in Switzerland during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic was up to three times higher than normal. Figures from the Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), reported in the NZZ am Sonntag, show that cases in April were over 350 per week, well above the norm (100-150). Max Klaus, deputy head of the NCSC, told the newspaper that cyber attacks often come in such waves, especially during a “special event” like the coronavirus pandemic. Incidents have included phishing, fraudulent websites, or direct attacks on firms – including some high-profile recent cases such as the attempt to extort $6 million (CHF5.77 million) from Stadler rail by hackers who stole business documents. And this might just be the tip of the iceberg, Klaus says: as Switzerland does not legally obligate companies or individuals to report incidents, the figures could be much higher. Jewgeni Kaspersky, head of the Kaspersky cybersecurity lab, told the NZZ that he was not surprised by the figures. Many people have been constantly online and working from home, he said, where they might not enjoy the same level of internet security as in the office. His lab, meanwhile, which works worldwide, recorded 68.7 million cyberattacks globally in April, compared with ‘just’ 57.2 million in February. The surprise, Kaspersky said, is that numbers have again receded in May. He reckons that hackers, having secured their bounties of data, might be currently trying to figure out how to make a profit by extorting or selling them on. He also said that hackers have begun to adapt their modus operandi and are now working less secretly, preferring to publish some stolen data in an effort to put pressure on those they are extorting. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he says, they have even targeted hospitals and patient data. The NCSC has not been made aware of any such attacks on hospitals in Switzerland.

2020-06-06;More anti-racism gatherings across Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/anti-racism-gatherings-continue-across-switzerland/45816114;Demonstrations and processions denouncing police violence and racism took place in several Swiss cities on Saturday, including a 5,000-strong gathering in Basel. Demonstrators in the northwest city carried posters bearing slogans such as “Black lives matter” and “White silence = violence”, the Keystone-SDA news agency reported. The protest, triggered by the death of George Floyd in the US city of Minneapolis last week, was not authorised, but police allowed it to proceed in any case, and it went off peacefully. Officers distributed flyers outlining guidelines regarding current anti-coronavirus measures, while participants distributed thousands of protective masks among themselves. Other Swiss cities that saw demonstrations on Saturday included Neuchâtel, where 500 people marched in two separate groups in order to respect current Covid-19 regulations that restrict such events to a max of 300. Several dozen gathered in front of the train station in Bern, while in Zurich – where a large demonstration also happened earlier this week – around 1,000 took part in an unauthorised march. As of Saturday June 6, events and demonstrations – including political protests – of up to 300 people are again possible in Switzerland, provided the participants can come up with a “protection concept” and designate a responsible person to engage with authorities. The question of public demonstrations and police reaction during the Covid-19 shutdown in Switzerland has been debated over the past weeks as unauthorised groups have regularly gathered to protest the lockdown measures.

2020-06-06;Art Basel 2020 cancelled due to coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/art-basel-2020-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus/45814614;This year’s edition of the world’s biggest art fair, initially rescheduled until September due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has now been cancelled altogether. “We had hoped to contribute to the recovery of the art market through a successful fair in September,” said Art Basel’s global director Marc Spiegler in a press release on Saturday. However, health and financial risks for exhibitors, as well as ongoing travel disruption, has forced the cancellation, the press release from event management MCH group said. The next edition will be held in June 2021, while digital galleries – launched after the fair’s sister event, Art Basel Hong Kong, was cancelled in March – will be further developed in the meantime. Another sister event, Design Miami Basel, which was due to be held at the same time as Art Basel in September, has also been put back until December. The decision is another setback for the MCH Group after its renowned Baselworld watch and jewellery fair was also shelved this year, joining a host of Swiss-based events that have been sacrificed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Switzerland, while events and demonstrations of up to 300 people are once again possible from June 6, there is still no news about when bigger events can be held.

2020-06-02; Pandemic triggers debate over home office rules, compensation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/employment-law_-pandemic-triggers-debate-over-home-office-rules--compensation/45793726;"The coronavirus pandemic led an unprecedented number of people to work from home in Switzerland, raising questions over laws applying to home office. Of renewed interest is a 2019 federal court ruling that employers must contribute to employees’ rent payments if they are required to work from home. When is this applicable? “This decision mainly shows that the responsibilities that the employer or the company has [towards employees] also apply to telework,” says Christine Michel, health and safety officer at the Unia interprofessional trade union, Switzerland’s largest labour union.. “The employer continues to be responsible for their health, ensuring that ergonomic conditions are met, that they can take breaks, and that working hours are respected. [Telework] can’t be a cost- saving programme.” We spoke to labour law experts Kurt Pärli of the University of Basel and Thomas Geiser of the University of St Gallen to clarify the implications of this ruling and other questions surrounding home office in the era of Covid-19. Kurt Pärli: In this ruling, the Federal Supreme Court made it clear that the employer must co-fund the rent for a workroom in the employee's home. A contractual agreement on this is not necessary; the obligation to pay the costs is derived from a provision in Swiss employment contract law (Art. 327)). It is important to note that employers are not obliged to pay if a workplace is available in the company and the home office is requested by the employee. If employees are only temporarily working in a home office because of the acute crisis, there is most cases no obligation for the employer to take over rental costs. The situation is different if the employee had to rent an additional room for the home office or, for example, had to use a room for work that was normally rented to other people. The judgment is only binding for this individual case. However, all employees who are permanently and not only temporarily working in home office on demand of the employer can claim compensation from the employer. Thomas Geiser: At the moment, the situation is a bit delicate, because the government has not forced people to work remotely. The Federal Council decision stipulates that some people, those who are at risk, may do so. And if this is not possible for one reason or another, the employer can also ask them to work on-site if the hygiene recommendations from the Federal Health Office can be guaranteed.. It's not so clear whether an employee can now, for this period of one or two months, ask the employer to pay something for the rent. It would depend on the specific situation. K.P: In many cases, home office arrangements are set out in the employment contract, which is also highly recommended.  Issues to be regulated are the share of the costs for rent, internet connection, printer paper and, if necessary, an office chair or similar things. In the absence of a contractual provision, Art. 327 of the Swiss Code of Obligations is decisive; the provision states that the employer must bear the necessary expenses for the performance of the work. In principle, if the employer decides to ask the employee to set up a home office, and also if the company does not have enough work space, the employer must pay for the costs of the home office. T.G:  It's always up to the party who wants something to ask the other to pay for it. Indeed, good practice is to stipulate a certain amount for that in the employment contract, also because the employer must know in principle what the employee costs. Otherwise, it is impossible for the company to make economic calculations. K.P: The principle is: if the space can also be used privately, then the costs must be shared. This was also the case in the facts of the 2019 Federal Supreme Court ruling. T.G.: Here lies the real problem. This is where the parties must discuss and find a solution together. Of course, it also depends on what is suitable for the job, for the position of this person. It's obvious that someone who does programming for computers probably needs a different kind of setting than someone who, for example, has to receive clients at home.  K.P: I don't think so, in many companies it is already possible to work [part time] from home. This affects the amount of office space required in the company. The experience with home offices during the corona crisis will lead to an even greater spread of the practice. The law sets the framework for ensuring that the costs do not have to be borne unilaterally by the employees K.P:  The employer is entitled and, under the Labour Code, even obliged to monitor the working time of employees, including in the home office. Even in the home office, the prohibitions on nighttime and Sunday work as laid down in the Labour Code may not be violated. Home offices carry risks for both employers and employees. For employers, there is a particular risk that the confidentiality of company data in the home office is not guaranteed. Here the employees must be very careful.  For the employee there is the danger in the home office that not only his work but also his private activities are monitored. Clear contractual rules are required here. T.G:  All the time an employee makes available to the company, to his employer, counts as working hours. If you are working in the company premises the question of whether you are getting your work done or reading the newspaper also comes up.  You always have the  impression that when the work is done at home you can't control it and if it's in the office you can control it. That's a mistake. K.P: This is a delicate problem, since insurance law questions may arise. If the employee is an EU/EFTA or Swiss citizen resident in the EU/EFTA and his or her home office workload is more than 25%it should be noted that he or she is subject to the social security law of the country of residence and the Swiss employer must pay social security contributions there. In the case of cross-border employment relationships, it may therefore be necessary to limit home office work to a low workload, i.e. below 25%. If, however, cross-border commuters temporarily worked in the home office during the corona crisis, this did not lead to a change in the social security subordination. A home office of more than 25% would have to be the normal situation, and only then would there be a change of status with regard to social security.

2020-06-02;How China is filling America's shoes at the United Nations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_how-china-is-filling-america-s-shoes-at-the-united-nations/45576590;"As the United States slowly withdraws its leadership from the multilateral system, China appears to be filling the political vacuum. Daniel Warner looks at the consequences of this “profound change”. Vacuums do not last long in nature. In biology, homeostasis represents the body’s attempt to reach equilibrium. In a void, elements will flow towards spaces of less density until an equilibrium is reached. In political systems, the same phenomenon may hold true. The United States was a moving force behind the creation of the United Nations. Although the organisation was established during the Second World War, with five permanent members of the Security Council each with veto power, the US was a leader of the multilateral system. Donald Trump’s campaign of “America First” has turned out to be a frontal assault on the UN and multilateralism. Whether withholding its contribution to the organisation (resulting in drastic cuts to its day-to-day business), withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council or appointing representatives in New York and Geneva who are opposed to any consensual leadership, the US has gone beyond “benign neglect”. Trump and his followers see the UN as an affront to their sovereignty, just as they see international law (or any law) as unjustly limiting their power. The UN system has been in limbo since Trump’s inauguration in 2016. There has been no American leadership. In New York, Ambassador Nikki Haley and her successor Kelly Craft have continually undercut consensual leadership with the refrain of “What’s in this for us (US)?” In Geneva, where the Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller foundations were instrumental in creating “International Geneva”, there was no American ambassador for two and a half years. The empty broken chair at the Place des Nations figuratively represents the obvious dismissal by President Trump of International Geneva and its pivotal role in human rights and humanitarian law. The Conference on Disarmament is blocked; the World Trade Organization (WTO) has become second fiddle to bilateral negotiations with ad hoc arrangements trying to salvage the non-functioning Appellate Body. And the appointment of Andrew Bremberg to finally fill the US Ambassador’s post in Geneva last October does not bode well for the future of US leadership. The 41-year-old has a career in domestic politics, having worked with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell in the White House on internal affairs. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson he is not. The former governor of Illinois, twice presidential candidate, helped found the UN in the 1940s. Stevensen later became US Ambassador to the UN and helped assuage international tensions during the Cold War. Can a system as large as the UN function without leadership? Can multilateralism exist without top down leadership from a major power? To return to homeostasis: Can the political vacuum left by America’s withdrawal from the system remain void? Or will some other power begin to fill the vacuum? The visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Switzerland in 2017 showed a determination by the highest Chinese authority to fill that void. A simple example would be the preparation of thousands of Chinese officials to understand the ins-and-outs of the WTO at specialized institutes in Beijing and Shanghai. There is a vision in Beijing of playing a greater leadership role in the system. Not only did Xi Jinping in 2017 announce China’s interest in multilateral leadership, the Chinese have shown results. They have influenced the WHO’s hesitant decision to declare coronavirus an international emergency; placed Fang Liu as head of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); placed Houlin Zhao as the head of International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Qu Gongyu as head of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). And in the upcoming election for head of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the Chinese Wang Binying is a serious contender. My colleague Stephane Bussard, journalist for Geneva’s Le Temps newspaper, asks: “Does the rivalry between China and the US risk paralysing the UN?” Perhaps the question could be rephrased as: “Does China wish to take over the multilateral system?” Is the growing multilateral influence of China in the UN system a political complement to the physical infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative? No one outside China knows the aim of China’s sudden interest in multilateralism. And it would be inappropriate to bash China with the unfolding of the coronavirus epidemic doing so much damage within the country. There is enough of that going on in the Western press. However, there is no question that China is filling a void left by the US in the multilateral system. Whether one sees China as a rising empire, as it once was in history, or one sees the US in decline, there is no question that we are witnessing a profound change. It does not matter if the change is precipitated by President Trump’s America First or China’s desire to re-establish its imperial rule. A void is being filled. Vacuums do not last long in nature. And neither do they in political systems.  A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Fang Liu is head of IATA, the International Air Transport Administration; she is in fact the Secretary-General of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

2020-06-01;Anti-coronavirus curbs found efficient;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/scientific-study_anti-coronavirus-curbs-found-efficient/45798060;The restrictive measures taken by the Swiss authorities have had a positive impact on stemming the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic according to a scientific study. The survey, carried out by the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, found that the gradual introduction of a ban on gatherings of more than five people and a reduced mobility helped contain infections. “Most of the reduction in transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity,” a paper published in the Swiss Medical WeeklyExternal link says. The findings are based on data from 11 of the country’s 26 cantons and more than 1,000 patients in Swiss hospitals between the end of February and March 20. The scientist also found that the number of new infections with coronavirus began to drop early in March, even before the government imposed sweeping measures, including the closures of schools. Towards the end of April, just under 4% of the population were infected with the virus, according to the study. The study authors also recommend a “cautious relaxation of social distancing practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers”. The government began easing some of the restrictions at the end of April. In a third stage to come into force, restrictions of public gatherings are relaxed and borders to some of the neighbouring countries are due to re-open in June. However, large gatherings remain banned and hygiene rules, including social distancing, are still in place. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Afterwards they have to spend a certain time on a normal ward. After that, it’s not so easy for them to simply go back to working again,” Antje Heise, SSICMExternal link deputy president, told SRF. But there is a difference in mortality rate depending on age: deaths were more likely to occur in the older age groups, with the younger patients more likely to survive, SRF reported. Meanwhile a survey of hospitals published by the SonntagsZeitungExternal link on Sunday found that by mid-May there had been 2,100 Covid-19 cases among doctors and nurses in Swiss hospitals. The infection rate among hospital staff was therefore low at slightly more than 2%. The most strongly affected were hospitals in French-speaking Switzerland, which has generally had more cases of the coronavirus. Most infections did not result in complications; fewer than 12 cases resulted in a long hospital stay. The newspaper survey 20 hospitals with almost 100,000 staff.

2020-05-31;It helps to be Swiss, says new boss of Palestinian refugee agency ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/unrwa_it-helps-to-be-swiss--says-new-boss-of-palestinian-refugee-agency-/45792894;"Philippe Lazzarini has a tough job. He officially took up the position as head of UNRWA, the UN’s embattled Palestinian refugee agency, on April 1, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. As a veteran of UN humanitarian coordination, especially in the Middle East, he doesn’t think he was appointed because he is Swiss. But it helps, he tells swissinfo.ch. He also has plans to get the organisation back on track.  “In the Middle East, Switzerland is one of the nationalities that’s still perceived as not being politically biased,” says Lazzarini. “There is still a perception of a country that has carried for a long time the notion of neutrality. Having said that, it’s certainly not the reason why I have been appointed. But it helps to be Swiss in a region like this one.”  Indeed, the Middle East conflict seems intractable and is highly sensitive, as is the mandate of UNRWA, the UN Refugee and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.   Founded by a UN Resolution in 1949, UNRWA is tasked with taking care of Palestinian refugees driven from their homes by the “Nakba” (“catastrophe” in Arabic) following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Their right to refugee status is based on a right to return to their homelands, but this has been an ongoing sticking point in peace negotiations. And from the original 700,000 displaced, their number has grown over generations to 5.6 million now in camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, as well as in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.    UNRWA, which relies largely on donations from UN member states, provides education, health care and social services to the refugees. But it is currently facing a severe financial crisis, especially since the Trump Administration cut funding in 2018.   Meanwhile, its former boss, Pierre Krähenbühl, also Swiss, resigned last year amid allegations of mismanagement; he claimed he was the victim of “dirty politics”, notably by the US and its ally Israel. Even the Swiss foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said in 2018 that UNRWA was part of the problem rather than the solution in the Middle East.  And now there is also Covid-19. Lazzarini’s first months on the job have not been easy. Coming from Beirut, where he was previously the UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon, he says it took three weeks to negotiate authorisations for the road trip to East Jerusalem, via Syria, Jordan and the West Bank. When he arrived, he was put in quarantine for two weeks. His first induction to the organisation was online.   “I guess it’s a new normal for all of us. But it was a little weird to start with an organisation that way,” he tells swissinfo.ch.  Fighting the spread of the coronavirus in the crowded Palestinian camps full of vulnerable people is a priority right now, he says. “We were extremely worried that if Covid-19 hit Gaza or the camps it would spread very rapidly.” But with only around 160 cases recorded to date in its five fields of operation, he says he is proud of how UNRWA has responded. It shifted its health services to telemedicine, and education to e-learning “from day one”, he says, while food delivery was shifted from distribution centres to home delivery to avoid situations where people would gather in large numbers.   “So I think that through a massive prevention campaign, but also because of the way we have adjusted our modus operandi, we have so far prevented the spread of Covid-19,” he says.  In addition to Covid-19 and its potential socio-economic impact on the refugees, Lazzarini says his top priorities will be to try to tackle UNRWA’s financial crisis and restore trust in the organisation. “I have to ensure that the organisation is adapted to its environment and that we draw the lessons of the crisis which hit the organisation last year,” he says. “To restore trust, a number of management initiatives need to be implemented.”  These initiatives are aimed at reinforcing the accountability of the agency, reinforcing its relations with its governing board (the advisory committee) and restoring financial transparency, he tells swissinfo.ch. “But beyond that, we need also to adjust the organisation, to create a culture in which everyone feels empowered. That’s the way to restore trust within the organisation, and also with a number of partners.”   Lazzarini says a number of these initiatives are already in the pipeline and are being discussed with member state representatives on the advisory board. He expects implementation to take 12-18 months.  What does Lazzarini say to the remark by Swiss foreign minister Cassis that UNRWA is part of the Middle East problem rather than the solution?   “There is no doubt that it is part of the solution, and I don't see any alternative to UNRWA and investing in what is contributing to peace and security here in the region,” he tells swissinfo.ch. “It would be a pity to abandon all the investment which has been undertaken in human development.”     But he acknowledges that the relevance and legitimacy of the organisation has been regularly questioned. Another priority will be to do something about this, he says. “My objective and my priority here is to ensure that we shield the organisation from political considerations, that the donors and the member states feel proud of their investment in the organisation. It’s important we focus on our mandate, on service delivery, on promoting the rights of the Palestinian refugees until the day there is a fair and lasting political solution in the region.”   Shielding UNRWA from politics might, however, be a tall order in a region which is so politically sensitive. Israel, which leads attempts to undermine UNRWA’s legitimacy, is currently looking to annex part of the West Bank under a controversial US “peace plan” drawn up by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. This would mean there was even less Palestinian land to go back to, even if the Palestinian refugees could ever go back.  Lazzarini declined to comment on the political process, saying only that he would be following on a daily basis “if any of these developments is impacting the ability of the agency to fulfil its mandate to ensure proper access to services for the Palestinian refugees”. He also tells swissinfo.ch that he is in contact with the Israeli government.  Switzerland was one of several countries that stepped in to help fill the UNRWA funding gap after the US withdrew its contributions in 2018. But it also suspended payments last year amid the mismanagement allegations, before resuming them again in December. And Cassis’s comments are unlikely to be forgotten.  Asked about his relations with the Swiss authorities, Lazzarini (who is both Swiss and Italian), is upbeat. He says he is already in contact from Jerusalem and there has been an exchange of letters.   “The Swiss government has been a strong advocate and a critical partner for UNRWA. I really expect and I understand that Switzerland will continue to be an important partner. Now, once travel permits, I will also come to Switzerland, and I definitely intend to have a more in-person dialogue with the authorities.”  Once the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, Lazzarini also intends to visit the refugee camps. “I intend to visit the camps every month in each of our fields of operation,” he tells swissinfo.ch. For the moment, however, in the crowded camps, restrictions remain in place.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The numbers are similar at competitor UBS. On March 25 the Swiss government announcedExternal link a scheme to provide cash-strapped small and medium-sized companies with emergency loans to get through the coronavirus crisis. Companies have to apply for the credit at their main banks. + Switzerland facing biggest economic slump since 1975  Loans of up to CHF500,000 are interest free while firms pay 0.5% on larger loans of up to CHF20 million. + Swiss firms rush to claim emergency coronavirus loans At Credit SuisseExternal link, smaller businesses  have so far received CHF2.2 billion, Rohner told Swiss pubic television SRF on SaturdayExternal link. These credits, limited to CHF500,000 at a time, have a 100% federal guarantee. The remaining CHF600 million are loans with an 85% federal guarantee and the bank securing the remaining 15%. It was important to make the money available quickly to avoid acute company cash flow problems, Rohner said. The transactions were quite informal and possible to do in just 15 minutes. This showed that Switzerland could get things done when everyone worked together, the chairman said. Credit Suisse did uncover a few fraudulent loan requests, but only in 0.4% of cases. These were mainly people who embellished the numbers to get a loan, he added. Rohner’s comments come shortly after rival big bank UBS revealed its loan figures. Announcing its first quarter results on ThursdayExternal link, UBS said that it had processed over 21,000 applications under the federal programme, totaling more than CHF2.5 billion.

2020-05-30;Second Swiss pandemic wave ‘could be more deadly’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science-saturday_second-swiss-pandemic-wave--could-be-more-deadly-/45795652; Researchers have used a mathematical model to calculate a possible second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland. Their conclusion: the wave would develop more slowly than the first, but could see up to 5,000 extra deaths. Should a second wave of the coronavirus come, it would proceed more slowly, meaning that the authorities would have more time to react and take measures than in the first wave, said Dirk MohrExternal link, a professor of Computational Modeling of Materials at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), who was involved in the research. Society has learnt from its experience during the first wave and would act with greater caution than at the start of the pandemic, he told ETH Zurich news earlier this weekExternal link. If the reproductive number should exceed 1 in the coming weeks and months (meaning that it would spread), it would almost certainly not reach the high levels of the first wave of infection in early March, he added. + Coronavirus: the latest numbers It is therefore unlikely that a second wave would overload Swiss hospitals, the team concluded. “This is good news, but it’s also deceptive,” Mohr said. “A second wave that rises very slowly, with a reproductive number just barely above 1, would be particularly insidious.” According to one scenario mapped in the study, there could be an extra 5,000 deaths from Covid-19. This would be on top of the more than 1,600 already recorded. The number of fatalities would however depend heavily on the wave’s extent and duration. The mathematical model was specially developed to forecast the Covid-19 pandemic in Switzerland and uses figures published by the Swiss cantons. The researchers have posted their model and calculations on the medRxiv platformExternal link (but their publication has yet to go through the usual peer-reviewing process). The researchers believe that their model calculations are the first ones to factor in Swiss demographics and age-related contact patterns in high detail, the news statement said. This meant they could calculate the reproductive number from the first wave for each age group. They found that 10- to 20-year-olds were heavily involved in spreading the virus and that 35- to 45-year-olds also had a higher-than-average contribution. By contrast, the elderly contributed far less on average to the spread. The research shows that all measures to lower transmission likelihood of would reduce the number of deaths. This especially applies to the workforce and to the 10-20 year-olds, it concluded. If the likelihood of transmission in schools is halved through social distancing and hygiene measures, “the expected number of additional fatalities across the entire population would drop from 5,000 to below 1,000”, the study found. Opinions are mixed over a possible second wave. On Thursday an expert at the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Taskforce said he thought there would be no big second wave, while the Federal Office of Public Health has said that while the infection trend was currently downwards, they would be observing the situation for any change in autumn.

2020-05-30;Help for apprentices hit by corona crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-effects_help-for-apprentices-hit-by-corona-crisis/45795480;Apprentices are to be better protected from losing their jobs during the coronavirus crisis, Economics Minister Guy Parmelin has announced. Around two-thirds of young people take the vocational route in Switzerland and spring/summer is a critical time.  School leavers are looking for and signing contracts to start apprenticeships in late summer. At the same time, a batch of trainees will be finishing their 2-4 year-long apprenticeships and moving into the work market. But the Swiss economy has been impacted severely by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, leading to fears of fewer apprenticeships - and follow-on jobs - being available. + Switzerland facing biggest economic slump since 1975  The new government regulation, which comes into force in June, will offer apprentices more security should their companies get into financial difficulties, Parmelin said in an interview published in Tamedia newspapers on Saturday.External link Companies on short-term work - a measure introduced to avoid redundancies that involves temporarily reducing staff working hours - are normally not allowed to hire extra staff, Parmelin said. But the government has made an exception for those about to finish their training, who will be allowed to stay on an extra year in their training companies. + Pandemic pushes more businesses into short-time working It’s currently very quiet on the apprenticeship market, Parmelin said. In German-speaking Switzerland, almost the same number of training contracts had been signed by the end of April as last year. But in the French-speaking part of the country, the situation is more worrying. Only 40% of apprenticeship contracts have been signed so far compared with last year. These differences are partly down to the fact that contracts are generally signed earlier in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, so many were already finalised before the coronavirus pandemic hit. There will be extra funds available for young people who have not been able to find an apprenticeship, Parmelin said. “So we won’t be subsidising apprenticeships in a direct way, but we will support cantonal and business organisations’ projects, for things like coaching and mentoring. These are things that work,” Parmelin said. The announcement is the latest in a series of measures taken by the government: it created a task force on apprenticeships in early May to expressly deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Two studies published in May have also pointed to the longer-term effects of the crisis on apprenticeships, with one expecting a larger rise in youth unemployment this summer. The country’s much admired dual-track apprenticeship systemExternal link sees young people combine on-the-job training with lessons in a vocational school, producing a well-qualified workforce. It is considered one of Switzerland’s economic success factors.

2020-05-30;Geneva's United Nations HQ a ghost town under lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/palais-sans-nations_geneva-un-hq-resembles-ghost-town-under-corona-lockdown/45787316;The United Nations building in Geneva has been deserted since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic. British photographer Mark Henley has ventured into the historic complex to capture the unique ghost town atmosphere.  The corridors and meeting rooms of the sprawling Palais des NationsExternal link, the UN’s second-biggest headquarters after New York, are usually full of hustle-and-bustle. The complex hosts 1,500 UN staff and regularly welcomes thousands of officials, experts and journalists for meetings. Each year, 2,500 international conferences and meetings are held in the western Swiss city, attended by around 200,000 delegates, including 4,500 heads of state, government and ministers.  But this year, on March 13, Covid-19 put a stop to business as usual at the Palais. The main session of the UN Human Rights Council was forced to suspend its work. Emergency restrictions were imposed on staff and the premises, in line with those in the rest of Switzerland. The huge 853,000m2 building became vacant overnight as most people decided to work from home. This is not the first time the Palais has stood empty. At the end of the 1930s the League of Nations, the forerunner to the UN, was forced to abandon the building when the Second World War broke out. Today it’s a pandemic, not a war, that has restricted its activities. The urgency of the global health crisis and its widespread economic damage demand that member states work together despite the huge challenges facing the multilateral system. States have shown that this is possible. Last week officials came together – virtually – for the World Health Assembly, which is normally held in Geneva. The results of the two-day online conference, notably an agreement on a Covid resolution crafted by the European Union, demonstrated a semblance of international unity during the current crisis.   Back at the Palais, the empty corridors may start filling up again soon. On May 22, UN Geneva Director-General Tatiana Valovaya announced that, as the virus situation was improving, staff working from home could start returning to their offices on a voluntary basis in early June. Social distancing and hygiene measures will continue to apply. Signs have been added around the building to restrict movements and a limited number of people will have access to meeting rooms.  Provided the Swiss government goes ahead with the third phase of easing lockdown, bigger conferences can also take place from mid-June at the Palais, but with formats adapted to the evolution of the crisis.    Despite this, in the coming months economic damage and funding concerns threaten to cast a long shadow over Geneva. The collapse in the number of conferences and visitors has already resulted in huge losses for local hotels and businesses. The long-term funding of the UN, international organisations and the extensive network of NGOs in the city could be at risk if states seriously tighten their purse strings.  Life is due to return to the Palais des Nations, but there is no guarantee of better days ahead.

2020-05-29;Switzerland reports first suspected Covid-19-related child fatality ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-_switzerland-reports-first-covid-19-related-child-fatality-/45793742;A young child has died from the possible consequences of a coronavirus infection, in the first case of its kind in Switzerland, the authorities have announced. Investigations into the case are ongoing. The news was confirmed by Stefan Kuster, head of the infectious diseases department at the Federal Office of Public Health, at a press conference in the Swiss capital Bern on Friday.  The infant, whose parents live in canton Aargau, became infected abroad. The case is being investigated, Kuster said. No further information was given.  However, Aargau's cantonal doctor told Swiss public television SRF later on Friday External linkthat it was not yet totally clear what the cause of death was. On May 26 a baby, under a year old, was transported by Rega to the Children's Hospital Zurich. The baby was extremely ill and tested positive for Covid-19, Yvonne Hummel told SRFExternal link. The child later died. The child had severe meningitis. Many viruses can cause this type of illness. We cannot at present say what the exact cause of death was, Hummel explained on Friday early evening. The case is being investigated. Kuster also said that two children had become infected with the coronavirus in Basel and that around 70 people had been put into quarantine as a result. Canton Basel City added in a statementExternal link that the two were brother and sister and had been attending primary school and Kindergarten in the west of the city. Those now quarantined included members of their family, as well as classmates and the children's two teachers. It is not yet known how the siblings came to be infected. Overall on Friday there were two reported deaths as a result of the coronavirus and 32 new infections. There has been a rise across the week: on Thursday the number was 20 and on Wednesday and Tuesday, 15.   Numbers are subject to change due to the lower numbers of tests at the weekend, but Friday’s toll should remind people that “the story of the coronavirus” is not yet finished, Kuster said.

2020-05-29;Federer is world’s highest paid athlete: Forbes;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/rich-list_federer-is-world-s-highest-paid-athlete--forbes/45794666; Roger Federer is world's highest-paid athlete in 2020, after the Covid-19 pandemic cut paydays for other top earners, according to the annual Forbes list. It the first time he has topped the list. The Swiss tennis star, who has a men's record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, notched up $106 million (CHF102 million) in pre-tax earnings over the last 12 months, including $100 million via endorsements, to move up four places and become the first player from his sport to top the rankings, Forbes said on Friday.External link Footballers Cristiano Ronaldo ($105 million), Lionel Messi ($104 million and last year’s list leader) and Neymar ($95.5 million) and American basketball player LeBron James ($88.2 million) rounded out the top five. The coronavirus pandemic triggered salary cuts for soccer stars Messi and Ronaldo, clearing the way for a tennis player to rank as the world's highest-paid athlete for the first time, said Kurt Badenhausen, senior editor at Forbes, said on Reuters The two football icons’ combined salaries dropped by $28 million from 2019. This was a result of salary reductions at many European football clubs when league play was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, Forbes said. Roger Federer is the perfect pitchman for companies, resulting in an unparalleled endorsement portfolio of blue-chip brands worth $100 million a year for the tennis great, added Badenhausen. Japan's Naomi Osaka ($37.4 million), ranked 29th on the list, went past fellow tennis player Serena Williams ($36 million) as the world's highest-earning female athlete.  Osaka and Williams were the only women on the list.

2020-05-29;Most Swiss primary schools to resume full lessons ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/post-corona-schooling--_most-swiss-primary-schools-to-resume-full-lessons-/45794170; Zurich and St Gallen - the last two German-speaking cantons operating split primary school classes as part of their post-coronavirus lockdown plans - have confirmed they are to go back to a full timetable by June 8.   This leaves Canton Ticino, the hardest hit by the coronavirus, as the only canton to continue the split class system after that date.  On Friday, Zurich and St Gallen announced that they would go back to a full primary school timetable on June 8, after a month of staggered classes (half a class at a time).   All compulsory schools (with pupils up to the age of 16) re-opened on May 11, after the government decided that primary school pupils were at little risk of transmitting the virus.   However, on Friday the authorities announced the first death in Switzerland of a young child from the consequences of the coronavirus, plus two cases of child infections in Basel.  + Switzerland reports first covid-19-related child fatality  Under Switzerland’s federal system, it’s the cantons that are in charge of educational matters – which resulted in a variety of approaches to re-opening, much to the worry of many parents and teachers. The move to re-open was also watched internationally.   + Uncertainty reigns as schools re-open amid coronavirus pandemic   While the majority of German-speaking cantons opted for “almost back to normal” – with a regular school timetable – many in French-speaking Switzerland, which was more strongly affected by the coronavirus, chose two weeks of staggered schooling. German-speaking economic powerhouses Canton Zurich (also more strongly affected) and Canton St Gallen (less so) were the exceptions.  In Italian-speaking Ticino, which borders Italy, is leaving the split classes system in place after June 8. The Swiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education (EDK), told swissinfo.ch on Friday that to its current knowledge it was the only canton to do so.   The canton says the system will continue until school summer holidays, which start earlier than many other cantons, on June 20. What happens after the holidays is not yet decided.  Post-compulsory schools, such baccalaureate schools which prepare pupils for university and vocational schools for apprentices, will be allowed to re-open for on-site teaching on June 8, under strict hygiene and social-distancing guidelines.   However, Canton Zurich’s director of education Silvia Steiner, also the head of all cantonal education directors, on Friday criticised the government guidelines as too strict and called on the government to ensure a return to normal teaching schedules, something which every pupil deserved.  Cantonal differences are well illustrated in BaselExternal link: while Canton Basel City is opting for full on-site teaching for upper schools from June 8, Canton Basel Country will keep to distance learning until the summer holidays. Canton Zurich will have half classes.  Meanwhile, earlier this week Denmark said that sending children back to schools and day care centres - Denmark was the first country in Europe to do so - did not lead to an increase in coronavirus infections, according to official data. This confirmed similar findings from Finland.   The United Kingdom has also announced that primary schools would gradually reopen from June 1, and while Swiss neighbour Germany is gradually re-opening schools, France has already done so for most primary and some middle schools.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-29;Fight over rights to Covid-19 drugs puts Switzerland in a tough spot;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/patent-protection_the-fight-over-the-rights-to-covid-19-drugs-puts-switzerland-in-a-tough-spot/45781430;Switzerland is caught between established practice and global solidarity when it comes to paying for and rewarding medical innovation. The Alpine country’s economy and its self-professed identity as an innovation powerhouse rely heavily on the rights and rewards attached to patents. It has the most European patent applications per capita and performs well in rankings of patent quality, a large portion of which are in the biomedical field. This is why recent calls by global health advocates and some governments to loosen patent protections during the Covid-19 crisis to make drugs and vaccines widely available have caused some unease in Switzerland. As more countries back a more flexible patent regime for Covid-19, Switzerland is finding itself pitted between industry on the one hand and global solidarity on the other. At the World Health Assembly in Geneva a couple of weeks ago, the Swiss government supported a resolution that called for the “voluntary pooling and licensing of patents to fight Covid-19”. But other calls to override or eliminate patents completely through compulsory licensing, open licensing or a so-called “People’s VaccineExternal link” have not been as welcome. “Switzerland takes intellectual property rights very seriously and will not undermine the regime so easily,” Gaétan de Rassenfosse, a professor of Innovation and intellectual property policy at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), told swissinfo.ch. While the global debate is centred on the current crisis, breaking entrenched views and laws on patent protection could open the door to debate about patents in other areas such as cancer and rare diseases where prices have become prohibitiveExternal link for some public health systems. Many in public health circles look to what happened when HIV drugs came on the market a couple decades ago as a precedent. Market exclusivity kept prices so high that less affluent countries, which had the greatest need for the drugs, were effectively shut out. In 2001, Basel-based Roche dropped the price of its HIV drug Nelfinavir by 40% after the Brazilian government threatened to use compulsory licensing, a clause in intellectual property lawExternal link that allows countries under certain conditions to grant licenses to public health agencies or generic manufacturers without the consent of the patentholder. Covid-19 is bringing the issue back to the forefront with added urgency as billions in taxpayer money, including from Switzerland, is funneled into vaccine research and clinical trials. This has created a nationalistic domino effect as a growing number of countries stake claims on R&D efforts. Paris-based pharma company Sanofi found itself backtracking under pressure from France after its CEO said the US government had the right to the largest pre-order of an eventual Covid-19 vaccine “because it’s invested in taking the risk”. Questions have been raised in Switzerland about whether it will have first dibs on any diagnostics, treatments or vaccines discovered or produced on Swiss territory by the likes of Roche or Lonza. The government announced last week it is negotiating with manufacturers, setting aside CHF300 million to secure access to a vaccine for the population. While governments jockey to secure special access to any promising solutions, most big pharma giants working on Covid-19 products are trying, at least publicly, to stay out of the crosshairs by talking up the industry’s “unprecedented collaborationExternal link” and the need for solidarity. “I sense a real responsibility among industry leaders,” said Thomas Cueni, who heads the Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). “We don’t want to run lotteries on who gets our medicines and our vaccines.” Cueni said that the leaders of Switzerland’s pharmaceutical companies were aware that demand for new treatments and vaccines could outstrip supply, but they would strenuously fight the loosening of their patent protections. Instead, companies were exploring bilateral voluntary licensing and existing mechanisms such as the Medicines Patent PoolExternal link that focus on access for poorer countries, as part of the “arsenal of options to make any Covid-19 products accessible,” Cueni said. Pharma giants also hope to ward off questions about patents by boosting supply. A Roche spokesperson told swissinfo.ch that it is ramping up production of the arthritis drug Actemra, which is currently in clinical trials against Covid-19, and aims to more than double production of its new coronavirus antibody test to more than 100 million tests a month by the end of the year. Still, the company admits that demand for tests “will exceed supply for the foreseeable future” and encourages countries to prioritise distribution for those who show clear symptoms. Patrick Durisch from Swiss NGO Public Eye argues that relying on voluntary acts by industry could hamstring the global response to the pandemic. “It is in the public and global interest to have as many producers as possible and make Covid-19 solutions available where they are needed,” he said.  “Companies are trying to show goodwill with drug donations and sharing their libraries of molecules, but they don't want to give up control of manufacturing and patents.” Public Eye is one of more than 70 organisations and individuals calling on governments, including Switzerland’s, to support the pooling of rightsExternal link and open licensing for all technologies necessary for the prevention, detection and treatment of Covid-19. These include not just the recipes for drugs but also “trade secrets” including technology and manufacturing processes, Durisch said. Innovation expert de Rassenfosse argues that companies are unlikely to give up control. “It is most likely that [companies] will use patents as a bargaining chip with individual governments or to receive some compensation. If they don’t patent, they will be left with nothing to exchange,” he said. Some companies have already signed dealsExternal link with manufacturers in Asia for patented drugs in effect side-stepping open licensing. The Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (IPI) has already received more than a dozen patents applications related to Covid-19 since the crisis began, a spokesperson told swissinfo.ch. It is unclear how many of these came from the biomedical sector. The European Patent Office declined to share patent application findings related to this coronavirus outbreak, arguing that it was too early to release such information and noting that patent applications remained confidential for 18 months. In some other countries, companies may have no choice but to share their findings. Germany and Canada amended laws to facilitate compulsory licensing during the coronavirus crisis. Israel also issued a permitExternal link allowing it to import a generic version of AbbVie’s Kaletra from India for coronavirus patients. De Rassenfosse says while legal, the proposition carries risk for Switzerland. “Any country that aggressively forces companies to give up patent rights should expect a change in the enthusiasm of companies for that market,” he said. Cueni told swissinfo.ch that compulsory licensing is an “extraordinary measure” and should not be used as a threat or routine policy tool, as it has a “chilling effect on innovation”. A spokesperson for the Swiss federal public health office also told swissinfo.ch that the office considered it as a “means of last resort.” Prior to the pandemic, many companies were shunning R&D in vaccines and antibiotics because they offered little prospect for profits. Felix Addor, the General Counsel at IPI told swissinfo.ch that “private companies could withdraw from or trim their R&D activities for vaccines or treatments against Covid-19 if countries issue or even threaten compulsory licenses. This is definitely not what Switzerland is aiming for.” Cooperation with patent holders, adds Addor, is a more promising and efficient way to find effective medicine. By granting licenses for others to manufacture, it can bring down the price without reducing the patent law. The debate is raising a more fundamental question: Are patents good or bad for innovation? Roche didn’t say if it was willing to participate in a global technology pool, but a spokesperson told swissinfo.ch that “intellectual property protection is essential for medical innovation and is needed to address the healthcare challenges we face today.” Companies pour billions into research, sometimes over decades with – in some cases – a 1% chance of being successful, according to their own estimates. “The whole system is built on the basis that innovation is rewarded by a limited exclusive right to the market,” said Christian Moser, a patent expert at IPI. “That inventors should be able to exploit innovation and to prevent others that are not innovative, but are simple copycats.” He acknowledges that the relationship between patents and innovation is not black and white. For public health advocates like Katy Athersuch, a policy advisor with Médecins sans Frontières in Geneva, patents are part of a proprietary approach when what we need right now is global solidarity. “We need complete sharing of everything that could help scale up manufacturing and enhance R&D so that we aren’t holding back any information that is helpful to our global response to Covid-19”. At this point, given the range of research activities under way on patented and off-patent drugs as well as new and old drugs, Esteban Burrone from Medicines Patent Pool, says it makes sense to keep the options open. “We are all trying to understand how to make therapies available rapidly to as many people as possible whenever there is proven efficacy,” said Burrone.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

It will review the submissions, set priorities based on the severity of the problems detected and make the necessary adjustments. The results will be updated daily and made available on the NCSC websiteExternal link.  The Swiss proximity tracking system is currently being tested in a pilot phase by selected groups. If parliament gives its approval to the legal basis, the application can be launched immediately.  The app, which people can voluntarily download and use, employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days – less than two metres proximity for more than 15 minutes – are alerted via the app to isolate themselves and get tested. The DP-3T system is decentralised with contacts and data stored on devices rather than on an external server.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-29;Will Covid-19 push Swiss multinationals forwards or back to business as usual?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eye-on-the-multinationals_will-the-pandemic-push-swiss-multinationals-forward-or-back-to-business-as-usual-/45791986;"The economy is getting back on solid footing here in Switzerland, giving many companies the nostalgic impulse to return to their pre-pandemic business ways. But is backwards what the people really want? The Responsible Business Initiative is headed back to parliament in June for another last-ditch effort at a counter proposal. If a public survey released this week is any indication, parliament will be under more pressure to reach a compromise or find itself at the mercy of Swiss voters, some 78% of whom support the initiative, according to the latest survey. That’s up 11 percentage points from February. This isn’t the only survey showing a more “woke” public. Market research firm Edelman called Covid-19 a “moment of reckoning” for business after its trust survey during the pandemic revealed that half of people believed business is doing poorlyExternal link or failing to put people before profits. Another one of its surveys a month ago found that 71% of people will lose trust in a brand if it is putting profits first and peopleExternal link second. What’s going on here? Renato Beck writes in the Wochenzeitung newspaper that “the coronavirus crisis has plunged us into fear; but it has also lifted us out of indifferenceExternal link.” It is indeed much harder to ignore problems in far-away countries when a single cough can bring supply chains to their knees. The crisis has also inspired empathy in the shared experience across borders. A few months ago, it was all survival mode. But as countries turn the lights back on, countries face tough questions about the underlying issues that led some to suffer more than others and about whether the push for profits blinded us to basic public health needs. And above all, how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. Could Covid-19 be the nudge campaigners for responsible business were hoping for? How has the pandemic changed your views on responsible business? Drop me a message: jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch Zug-based oil trader Kolmar has come under fire for shady business deals in Libya. According to an NGO investigation released in March, Kolmar purchased oil from the war-torn country with the help of armed groups and a series of middlemen. The company denies involvement in any smuggling activities and said it did its due diligence. But TRIAL International says there were plenty of red flags in the dealings in the country. If a company knowingly buys stolen raw materials from a country at war, it can be found guilty of complicity in pillaging, according to the NGO. A criminal complaint is now in the hands of the Swiss attorney general. Lonza has been thrown into the spotlight over its partnership with US firm Moderna for its mRNA vaccine. As more governments try to stake claims on any eventual Covid-19 treatment or vaccine, questions have been swirling about whether Switzerland will have first dibs on anything produced by the more than 100-year-old company. Interim CEO Albert Baehny sought to set the record straight, clarifying that Moderna owns the intellectual property. But questions about who will have access to the first doses of a vaccine aren’t going away soon. Novartis is re-entering the vaccine business after divesting the division in 2015. The venture is a far cry from traditional vaccine development though. According to a Reuters report, the company’s gene therapy US subsidiary AveXis is applying some of the technology and manufacturing used for its spinal muscular atrophy therapy Zolgensma to the development of a coronavirus vaccineExternal link. With Massachusetts General Hospital in the US, the company aims to insert genetic material that makes up the new coronavirus’s “spikes” into a so-called adeno-associated virus, before injecting it into humans to provoke an immune response against Covid-19.

2020-05-28;Swiss population projected to top 10 million by 2050;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/demographic-trends_swiss-population-projected-to-top-10-million-by-2050/45791540;Those 65 and older will see their ranks swell by 70%, while the working-age population will grow at a much slower pace, the Federal Statistical Office said on Thursday.  The Statistical Office projectsExternal link an average annual increase of 0.6% in the number of permanent residents in Switzerland, which would bring the population to 9.4 million in 2030 and to 10.4 million in 2050. Three-quarters of this growth will come from immigration.  The country counted 8.6 million inhabitants at the end of 2019. The ageing of the population will be rapid in the coming decade, as members of the baby boom generation reach retirement age. Increased life expectancy will also account for the rise in the number of seniors, the Statistical Office said. According to its projections, there will be 2.7 million people aged 65 and over in 2050, compared with 1.6 million at the end of 2019. By contrast, the number of people of working age (20-64 years) will increase by just 12%, to reach 5.6 million in 2050.  These projections were made before the coronavirus pandemic, the Statistical Office pointed out, adding that deaths from Covid-19 were unlikely to have a major impact on demographic trends. The crisis could, however, have an effect on immigration, depending on how the Swiss authorities manage the economic fall-out.  In the coming decades, the population will continue to concentrate around the greater Zurich area and the Lake Geneva region. The southern canton of Ticino and canton Graubünden in eastern Switzerland, however, will experience a slight decline – of nearly 5% – in population. The Statistical Office also projects the proportion of women with a university degree or higher vocational education to equal that of men by 2030 before tipping the balance by 2040, when 57% of women will have degrees compared to 54% of men. At the end of 2019, 48% of men and 41% of women had achieved higher education. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-28;Geneva NGOs face uncertain future due to Covid-19 funding impact;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_geneva-ngos-face-uncertain-future-due-to-covid-19-funding-impact/45791450;The immediate impact of the pandemic on Geneva-based non-governmental organisations has been restrained, a survey reveals. But NGOs fear tough times ahead linked to funding.  Some 79% of NGOs have been forced to reduce their activities due to the pandemic, a surveyExternal link published on Thursday shows. One in four have cut staff, but compared to other sectors of the economy, NGOs “seem to have been relatively spared in the short term”, said the authors, describing the impact as “moderate but real”.  Over half (54%) of the 125 NGOs – out of 450 operating in International Geneva – which answered the poll said the overall impact had been ‘mild’, while 44% described it as ‘severe’. One-quarter said they had been forced to cut staff, while another quarter said they would do so over the next six months. Recently, the Geneva Disarmament PlatformExternal link announced it was closing after three years due to Covid pressures. But the survey authors did not find any others driven to such extremes. Around 5% (six NGOs) said the virus posed a danger for the future of their organisation, while 47% (53) said the threat was ‘substantial’.  Over the past three months dozens of meetings and conferences in Geneva have been cancelled or suspended due to the pandemic. On March 13, the coronavirus put a stop to business as usual at the UN Palais des Nations, for example. Emergency restrictions were imposed on staff and the premises, in line with those in the rest of Switzerland. The main session of the UN Human Rights Council, a popular NGO event, was forced to suspend its work. Another essential NGO gathering – the World Health Assembly – managed to hold its annual meeting last week, albeit virtually. The Palais is due to welcome some staff back next month due to the improved virus situation in Switzerland. The vast majority of NGOs (90%) that replied to the survey said they have close working ties with the UN and 30-odd international organisations in Geneva, with two-thirds saying these relations had been adversely affected. Around 77% said they had to cancel meetings planned in Geneva.  “The ecosystem of International Geneva – the continuous interactions between permanent missions, states and international organisations and NGOs – seized up due to the virus. But it has managed to continue to function via online meetings,” said Julien Beauvallet,External link head of canton Geneva’s NGO service, which commissioned the survey. There have been some upsides: three-quarters of NGOs set up projects linked to Covid and have demonstrated a certain reactivity, he added. But clouds continue to gather over international aid agencies and charities. Oxfam, one of the world’s leading aid agencies, announced last week it is to phase out its offices in 18 countries and cut 1,500 jobs, or one third of its staff, because of the financial strain caused by the pandemic. Just over half of Geneva-based NGOs (53%) say they are facing lower income. In all, 14% said funds had been withdrawn amid the pandemic, while 36% experienced reduced funding, and 42% delayed. An NGO surveyExternal link carried out earlier this month among 116 British international development organisations painted an even bleaker picture than that of Geneva. In all, 70% of the British NGOs expected some financial difficulty in the coming months and 43% believed they would not survive in the next six months if they didn’t receive additional funds. Beauvallet said the financial impact on Geneva-based NGOs seemed relatively marginal so far, but that people still had major long-term worries.  “NGOs are mostly financed by states and international organisations in annual or pluriannual cycles and there will certainly be a lag given the current crisis. The reactions of donors will be important,” he declared. “The funding outlook is very bleak. There are big fears and uncertainties among NGOs about the donors. This includes any potential budgetary changes in next few years but also fears about the place of NGOs in International Geneva if the current interactions are not possible due to social distancing, travel restrictions and other Covid measures.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-28;Red Cross launches CHF3 billion pandemic appeal;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/supporting-vulnerable_icrc-launches-chf3-billion-pandemic-appeal/45791382;The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has called for CHF3.1 billion ($3.2 billion) in extra funding to help vulnerable communities cope with the coronavirus pandemic. The joint appeal builds on an earlier one launched on 26 March 2020 and aims to increase life-saving services and support to address both the immediate impacts of the pandemic and its long-lasting social and economic repercussions , a statement said on May 28External link. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is working hand in hand with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, at the intersection of the pandemic, armed conflict and violence to ensure that we assist both now and beyond the pandemic's immediate effects to help families in the long-run,  said ICRC Director-General Robert MardiniExternal link.  The money is needed to reinforce healthcare and sanitation, improve prison conditions, provide mental health support and help people bury victims of the pandemic. Front-line aid workers need to implement measures to control infections and detect people who have caught the disease, the ICRC added. Another concern is protecting doctors, nurses, pathologists and morticians in conflict and disaster zones and refugee camps. The families of Covid-19 victims also need support. “A failure to adequately plan for mass-casualty situations risks people being buried in mass graves, causing suffering to families who may not know where their relatives are buried,” the statement read. Launching the appeal, Mardini said: “This pandemic is creating crisis-level needs that will endure long into the future, whether for mental health support, conflict zone medical aid or livelihood assistance.” Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) added: In fragile humanitarian contexts, the COVID-19 pandemic is creating new vulnerabilities for people who are already most at risk. We now face a crisis on top of a crisis with worsening poverty and food insecurity alongside crippling economic conditions and a lack of public health services, safe water, sanitation and hygiene. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement consists of three parts: the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and 192 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

2020-05-28;How flying in and out of Switzerland will look post-Covid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-normal_how-flying-in-and-out-of-switzerland-will-look-post-covid/45790846;Airports and airlines have outlined new safety measures as flights start to ramp up in Switzerland. Face masks are mainly recommended, but are in some cases compulsory, while social distancing measures may increase waiting times once passenger numbers increase. While the wearing of masks is highly recommended, rather than compulsory, at Zurich and Geneva airports, police will have the power to insist on them being worn if people become too tightly packed together. Basel-Mulhouse airport says that face masks will be mandatoryExternal link. All three airports have installed plexiglass screens and have increased cleaning services, focusing especially on surfaces that could be touched by many people, such as stair handrails and elevator buttons. Disinfectant hand dispensers will be made available for passengers. Floor markings have also been added to aid social distancing. Zurich says it will open extra passport control booths and make use of overflow lanes at security check. The number of passengers will be restricted on buses taking travellers to aircraft at Geneva airport, as it will be on buses and the Skymetro rail link running to Terminal E at Zurich. Zurich will limit the number of people greeting incoming passengers at arrivals in Terminal 2. Shops at both Geneva and Zurich airports will be open with hygiene and social distancing measures in place. Swiss International Air Lines has strongly recommended that passengers wear masks, but EasyJet has taken it a step further by making this a necessary condition for flying. Food will not be available on EasyJet flights for the time being. For its part, SWISS will start with a restricted meal and drinks offering. Magazines and duty-free shopping will also not be available on-board aircraft initially. Neither airline will restrict passenger seating. EasyJet once mooted the idea of leaving middle seats free but has dropped the idea. Thomas Frick, chief operating officer at SWISS, told reporters on Thursday that the airline could not afford to operate flights with reduced seating in the long run. EasyJet, SWISS and Edelweiss will resume some passenger flight routes from Switzerland in June. SWISS plans to operate up to 190 flights from Zurich and Geneva to 41 European destinations, but estimates that by the end of the year services will only be at 50% of pre-crisis levels. Edelweiss, also part of the Lufthansa group, returned to the air on May 28, with plans to operate 171 flights to 36 holiday destinationsExternal link by the end of June. EasyJet will start to fly out of Geneva again on June 15 to popular holiday destinations. Flights will also increase at Basel-Mulhouse starting in JuneExternal link. This week, the Swiss government unveiled its final plans for bringing the country out of lockdown. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-27;Government announces major easing of coronavirus restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/no-more-emergency_government-announces-major-easing-of-coronavirus-restrictions/45788336;The Swiss government has announced a significant relaxation of restrictions and, as of June 19, an end to the extraordinary situation to deal with the coronavirus crisis. It said this was made possible by the low number of new infections in recent weeks. Interior Minister Alain Berset, who holds the health portfolio, said they were now around only 20 per day. An end to the extraordinary situationExternal link means powers will be handed back to the cantons. Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating presidency this year, told a press conference on Wednesday that parliament would also be responsible for deciding on coronavirus restrictions.  We have managed to get the virus under control, said Sommaruga, and extended thanks to everyone who has made it possible . The rate of infection is low, the shops are open and the hospitals are ready, she told the press conference. So it was now a question of moving to a new normal in which the responsibility for ensuring continued protection was on businesses and employers. Free movement of people will be restored throughout the Schengen area by July 6, Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told the press conference. Swiss companies will also be able to recruit from the European Union, EFTA and third countries from June 8, under certain conditions.   Borders with Germany, Austria and France will be open for tourism and professional visits from June 15, she said. However, although Italy has announced it will open its border on June 3, Keller-Sutter said Switzerland was not yet ready to open to Italy on that date, but it was maintaining contacts to ensure a coordinated approach.+ What's happening at Swiss borders and airports?  As of May 30, spontaneous gatherings of up to 30 people such as football matches and picnics will be allowed. Public events gathering up to 300 people and all leisure and tourism activities can resume on June 6. These include cinemas, theatres, swimming pools, zoos, campsites and group excursions. Rules are also being eased for restaurants. Table numbers will no longer be limited to four, but if there are more people, guests must leave a contact in case tracing becomes necessary. Tables must still be two metres apart. Berset stressed the continued need to follow hygiene and social distancing rules, as well as the need for contact tracing.  Berset said older people can now resume a social life and see their grandchildren. He said they had been able to stay at home because of support extended by others and that this solidarity should help them return to public life. With regard to at-risk employees, he said employers should continue ensuring protection and allowing them to work from home, or guarantee their salary if this is not possible. For other employees, he said the government still recommends home working, which also eases the transport system, but that it would be up to employers to decide.   Berset said this was an ambitious plan but that we remain pragmatic . He said it was also too soon to allow large events likely to draw more than 1,000 people, which remain banned at least until the end of August. He also used the press conference to thank Daniel Koch, the head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), who has become a key figure in the government's crisis management. Koch is to retire, having delayed his retirement because of the crisis.+Who is Switzerland's 'Mr Coronavirus'? Berset praised Koch's unwavering commitment , saying he had participated in every cabinet press conference and 21 expert ones each time with a new tie . I hail his scientific knowledge, his capacity to explain things simply and his modesty in the face of a virus about which we knew very little at the start, said Berset. The Conference of cantonal governments welcomed the decision to end the emergency situation on June 19, saying cantons were capable of deciding appropriate measures on a regional basis. The epidemiological situation is very different from one canton to another, according to the Conference president Benedict Würth, and the maintenance of nationwide rules is no longer appropriate. He said the advantages of the Swiss federal system should be used to ensure that appropriate measures were taken according to the local situation on the ground.

2020-05-27;Swiss earmark CHF879 million for development banks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/poverty-and-covid-19_swiss-earmark-chf879-million-for-development-banks/45788156;Switzerland is to contribute CHF879 million ($907 million) to help fight poverty, promote sustainable development and deal with the health, social and economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis on the world’s poorest countries.  This money will go to the International Development Association (IDA/World Bank) and the African Development Fund (ADF), the government said in a statementExternal link on Wednesday.  “The Covid-19 crisis threatens to jeopardise the progress made in recent decades in reducing poverty and improving health and living standards in many developing countries,” it said.  “The multilateral development banks play a major role in managing crises and in combating extreme poverty. With their expertise and financial means, they are effective in addressing global challenges such as pandemics, financial crises and climate change.”  Switzerland will commit CHF683 million to restock the IDA coffers and CHF196 million for those of the ADF. This money will be paid out over nine to ten years.  Switzerland is also contributing CHF115 million to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), continuing the support it began in 2005. Under this initiative, loans to heavily indebted countries made by the IDA and the ADF are successively written off, provided these countries introduce certain reforms.  Around three-quarters of Switzerland’s contributions has been earmarked from the existing 2017-2020 framework budget to fund technical cooperation and from the aid fund for developing counties. The remainder will be taken from the subsequent framework credit for development cooperation. This still has to be approved by parliament.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-27;Swiss government can learn from coronavirus, says chancellor  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-business-_swiss-government-can-learn-from-coronavirus--says-chancellor--/45787704; The Swiss federal administration can learn some lessons from the coronavirus crisis, including looking at the way it procures medicines, says Chancellor Walter Thurnherr.   In an interview with Blick newspaperExternal link published on Wednesday, he said the federal authorities should also re-examine planning and prevention measures for pandemics. “We should also ask if the law on epidemicsExternal link needs to be changed,” said Thurnherr, who is the country’s top civil servant.   Thurnherr praised the way the government has handled this crisis, saying a certain amount of improvisation was inevitable.    “In a collegial system mistakes are also possible, but I would say they are generally less likely,” he told Blick.    While agreeing that things happen more quickly if only one person is taking the decisions in a crisis, he added that “quick decisions can always be taken – but at the risk of getting it completely wrong”.    Switzerland’s collegial system of government means that problems usually have to be carefully analysed from different perspectives, but time pressure meant this was hardly possible in the Covid-19 crisis.    “We had to draw up and check, sometimes within a very short time, some 170 coronavirus-related dossiers, some of which were extensive or involved billions of francs,” Thurnherr recounted. He said civil servants were often working on the files until midnight for a decision to be taken early the next morning.    Normally there is only one cabinet meeting per week, but “in March we had up to five meetings in eight days”, Thurnherr told the paper, and some civil servants had to work around the clock.    The Federal Chancellor heads the Federal ChancelleryExternal link, which plans and coordinates government business. Chancellors also take part in the weekly government meetings, where they have an advisory role. As the government’s chief of staff, they can mediate, coordinate, co-author reports, make proposals and even submit motions.

2020-05-27;Swiss photographer captures the nature of changed borders;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bordering-on-beauty_swiss-photographer-captures-changing-nature-of-borders/45758090;Living in a small country surrounded by other states, borders feature in the daily lives of many Swiss and become a focal point while closed during the coronavirus outbreak. Swiss photographer Roger Eberhard captured images of former borders in a project that took over three years to complete, resulting in a book that has now become particularly relevant. The artist and publisher from Zurich said he wanted to make a book about borders to show “a visible and ever-changing cartographical puzzle of our world”. Eberhard sees country boundaries as “fluid” and tied to politics, citing how the number of countries in the world has changed since the 1960s. In light of entry bans, border walls and mass migration being regularly on the global news agenda, Eberhard wanted his photography to reinforce what he sees as the “transcience of these man-made markings”. He travelled from country to country to gather the images for ‘Human Territoriality’, published in March 2020. His aim was to show how lines on a map sometimes fade, move or become overgrown in reality, and as such, he only took photos of locations where the borders have changed, disappeared or even where the countries that used to be on either side have ceased to exist. Each image in the project has a story behind it, poetically depicting a time and place in history, and showing what happens when politics or climate change alter the way we see the world. Two Swiss locations matched his criteria: Furggsattel, a mountain pass in the southwestern canton of Valais, was one of them. The other was Ellhorn in eastern Switzerland, which became a focal point during World War II for the Swiss. Switzerland wanted to include neighbouring Liechtenstein in its national defence programme because its position was ideal for an attack on the Swiss border. Liechtenstein was unwilling to hand itself over due to its relations with Germany at the time. Finally, after negotiations, financial and territorial compensation, Liechtenstein handed over various locations of strategic and military importance to Switzerland, including the striking Ellhorn (shown in the first picture). The 758-metre mountain has belonged to the municipality of Fläsch, Switzerland since 1949.    This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-27;2021 Geneva Motor Show ‘very uncertain’ as organisers reject loan;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_2021-geneva-motor-show--very-uncertain--as-organisers-reject-loan/45787458;The 2021 edition of the Geneva International Motor Show remains touch and go after the organisers rejected the terms surrounding a state rescue loan.  This year’s car show was cancelled four days prior to its opening due to the coronavirus outbreak, costing an estimated loss of CHF11 million ($11.3 million) for the organisers of Switzerland’s largest public event.  Canton Geneva came to their rescue with the offer of a CHF16.8 million loan to be reimbursed over 15 years at low interest rates. This would help cover the cost of the cancellation and plan for the 2021 event. But on Tuesday the foundation that organises the event rejected the loan based on the conditions attached to it. In a statementExternal link, the foundation thanked the Geneva authorities for its offer, but added: “Unfortunately, the conditions attached to the loan, which, in particular, aim to completely outsource the show including its conceptualisation to Palexpo SA [the company running the Geneva congress centre], are not acceptable to the foundation.” “In fact, they are in contradiction to the statutes and especially to the purpose of the foundation formulated more than 100 years ago.” It added that the organisation of the 2021 event was “very uncertain at the moment” and that motor exhibitors had instead strongly recommended to plan for the next edition in 2022. The organisers are reportedly seeking alternative funding. The car show, which was due to take place from March 5-15, was cancelled on February 28 as a force majeure after the Swiss government banned large gatherings in order to limit the spread of Covid-19. The Geneva Motor Show is the largest public event in Switzerland. Last year it attracted more than 600,000 visitors and almost 10,000 media representatives. The event generates an estimated CHF200 million in direct and indirect income for canton Geneva. It also represents a third of the Palexpo congress centre’s annual income and accounts for numerous jobs. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-27;Switzerland’s safety net must be there for all;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_switzerland-s-safety-net-must-be-there-for-all-/45785396;"Images of several thousand people queuing each weekend to receive food parcels in wealthy Geneva have circulated in the international press recently. The working poor and undocumented migrants in Switzerland have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. A group of concerned citizens in Geneva is calling for respect for migrants’ fundamental rights and for regularisation. For many foreign observers, the fundamental right to food is something that has always been observed in Switzerland. Yet recent distributions of food aid by the local authorities, NGOs and private associations at the Vernets sports centre in Geneva seem to have taken the international press External linkby surprise. For almost a month now this trend has been visible and continues to grow. In the international capital of human rights, Switzerland’s second-biggest city, and in a country often praised for its excellent economic and social organisation, part of the population is in dire need of food. People who previously did not believe fundamental rights to be at risk in our country are suddenly aware that food is a basic right and that, if necessary, it is the community’s responsibility to guarantee it. People without legal status, so-called undocumented migrants, represent more than half of the people receiving food at Les Vernets. However, those who have been working with this population for years and are familiar with their plight know that in Switzerland—yes, even here—fundamental rights are not only at risk, but are sometimes ignored. In reality, we are often incapable of treating all human beings like human beings. If it were not for the startlingly depressing spectacle of Vernets, we could perfectly well continue to shut our eyes to the fact that thousands of people in Geneva, and an estimated 100,000 sans papiers  in Switzerland, do not even dare report an assault or a theft. The rule of law does not apply to everyone; it applies first and foremost to those who hold the right papers. The overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens probably feel that it is our duty to ensure everyone has access to justice, food, healthcare, etc. People quite often insist that in Switzerland there is always a right to report abuse, to get treatment in hospital and to be helped if you lose your job. The facts, however, tell a completely different story. The lack of solidarity and of the opportunity to assert one's rights are starkly revealed when society has to face extraordinary constraints such as what we are experiencing with Covid-19. Unsurprisingly, anyone who is vulnerable or in a precarious situation is the first to suffer in such circumstances. Some authorities and organisations active in the fields of social assistance and integration started to notice and deplore such lawless no-go areas a long time ago, and have been trying to do something about them. Thirty-five years ago, Dominic Föllmi, a Geneva state councillor, personally accompanied a young girl without legal status to school for the first time. Since then, following Geneva’s example, the fundamental right of children to attend school has been respected in many parts of Switzerland. Elsewhere, Geneva University Hospital’s Mobile Outpatient Consultation Unit for Community Care (CAMSCO) also provides medical care, regardless of the patient’s status. But the fear of denunciation and deportation means that other fundamental rights - such as the right to a private and family life, proper access to justice or protection against exploitation at work - are in practice not guaranteed. Notable efforts are being made by some authorities and a large number of NGOs, and they should be welcomed. However, they can be seen as an uncoordinated patchwork or, worse, amateurish. In view of these examples and of the plight of those queuing up at Les Vernets, it is obvious that the only approach that will guarantee fundamental rights are respected is the regularisation of undocumented migrants. Regularisation is key, but the fact that a number of people queueing up at Vernets actually have regular papers shows that it is not sufficient. What is really needed is to eliminate precarity more generally, the permanent threat of suddenly descending into poverty. Many people go to Vernets because they do not dare take advantage of the welfare payments they are entitled to, for fear of losing their residence status. For many foreigners, not claiming welfare payments is a condition for the renewal of their work or residence permit. These people are therefore caught in a Catch-22 situation: either starve, or lose the right to work and earn money to live on. Unless the conditions that create such precarity are changed, for those with or without papers, certain fundamental rights will continue to be ignored. Not only is regularisation necessary, but recent experience has proven that it is possible. Prior to the Papyrus pilot project (2017-2018) [to regularise long-term undocumented migrants in Geneva], the argument was often heard in some circles that regularization would attract other people and illegal immigrants would flock en masse to Switzerland. But the results of the Papyrus scheme, scientifically evaluated by experts, proved that this was not the case. Today, we don't need a continuation of Papyrus. Papyrus was a test that was limited in time and scope. We need an approach that makes sense both in human and legal terms. It consists of regularising undocumented migrants on the basis of clear and predictable criteria. And the recent moves to regularise undocumented migrants in ItalyExternal link and Portugal during the coronavirus crisis prove that another policy is possible.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-05-26;Swiss hospitals and start-ups test disinfecting robots;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/germicidal-irradiation_robot-blasts-coronavirus-with-uv-light/45785228;Self-driving disinfecting robots with a UV-C lamp tower are currently being tested in hospitals, but the process could be applied to other closed environments. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a disinfection method that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light to kill or inactivate micro-organisms by disrupting their DNA. As the light is dangerous to humans too, the robot only works in uninhabited environments.  In order to save energy, the Swiss start up Rovenso is working on a robot that detects places frequently touched by people, which it then targets with its UV-C light. This option could interest closed environments that don’t need a thorough disinfection, like offices or other work areas. Prototypes are currently being tested, but orders haven't increased, as hospitals and workplaces are still busy fighting the coronavirus.

2020-05-26;Coronavirus fuels Swiss bicycling surge ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mobility_coronavirus-fuels-swiss-bicycling-surge-/45785258;While demand for public transport collapsed during Switzerland's partial lockdown, bicycle usage soared across the country. But greater acceptance of cycling nationwide will depend on further political decisions and transport planning.  Ernst Leuthold, the owner of a bike shop in Bern, can’t believe his eyes.  “It’s amazing to see all these people who haven’t been on a bike for years and then suddenly feel the need to do so,” he declared.  Daniel Schärer, director of 2roues SuisseExternal link, a trade association for two-wheel vehicles, concurs: “During the lockdown, bike shop repair workshops were extremely busy.” And it’s likely that the sales of bikes will take off in the coming months, he added. Most of these new clients probably discovered cycling for fun whilst at home. But “there are undoubtedly others who turned to bikes, particular electric bikes, to go to work”, he added. If bike usage is to continue to grow, it will most likely be people who combine cycling with other forms of transport as most of the population work far from their homes. For example, this could involve cycling to the station in the morning and taking a train to work and then doing the same on the way home. Jörg Beckmann, a transport sociologist and director of the Mobility AcademyExternal link, is convinced that commuters could turn to other forms of transport. The sharp spike in e-bike sales during the lockdown is a possible sign of this. “It’s possible that some commuters will cycle to work to avoid public transport,” he said. Unlike other forms of transport, bike usage has increased sharply during the lockdown. An ETH Zurich MobisExternal link study revealed that on some days during the lockdown, cyclists covered three times the number of kilometres compared with autumn 2019. But it is clear that further political decisions and transport planning are necessary to ensure this new mobility is properly integrated as society slowly returns to normal. During the recent surge, this month the government announced the creation of legal foundations to improve the quality and safety of cycle paths in Switzerland. This follows Swiss voters’ approval in 2018 of a proposal to enshrine cycling and cycling infrastructure in the country’s constitution. In a statementExternal link, the government said cantons were responsible for building cycle paths and would be obliged to plan a safe network of interconnected routes. Pro Vélo, the Swiss cycling association, was full of praise forExternal link the Swiss authorities. “They have understood the population’s clear wish to see an increase in cycling traffic and want to reply to this,” it declared. However, it added: “There is still a long way to go before Switzerland catches up with other model countries like the Netherlands or Denmark,” said Pro Vélo President Matthias Aebischer.  The problem is that cycling is not a political priority in Switzerland, Patrick Rérat, professor at the University of Lausanne, recently told the Le Temps newspaper. While many other European cities quickly moved to create additional cycling paths during the pandemic - Rome (150 km), Brussels (40km), Berlin (22km) and Barcelona (21km) – there were few changes in Switzerland.  Yet there is a clear link between safe cycling infrastructure and increased usage, said Rérat. “In Switzerland the cities with the best cycle paths are Basel and Bern. And that’s where there are the most cyclists,” he added. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-26;SwissCovid tracing app accidentally made available to public;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/test-mishap_swisscovid-tracing-app-accidentally-made-available-to-public/45784868;The public has had access to a Swiss-made contact tracing app despite it being in the testing phase and yet to be approved by parliament. The DP-3T “SwissCovid” app was openly available in the Google Play Store for several hours when access should have been restricted. A spokesman for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), which co-designed the app, said the mistake had been rectified on Tuesday morning. Emmanuel Barraud told swissinfo.ch that there was no way of telling how many unauthorised people had downloaded the app but that this should not affect the effectiveness of the test phase. On Monday, employees of the Swiss army, of several hospitals and cantonal administrations, and of federal technology institutes EPFL and ETH Zurich were given access to the app on a voluntary basis as part of a large-scale pilot phase in Switzerland.  Access was successfully restricted on iPhones, but for several hours any Android user could search for the app and download it. On Tuesday morning Google Play Store said more than 1,000 people had downloaded the app, but no further details are known of the number of downloads and how many were outside the authorised test group. Barraud said the increased data could actually help determine the effectiveness of the app during the test phase. He added that doctors had been told not to issue confirmations of Covid-19 infections to anyone outside the test group. This is needed to generate a code to alert other app users. The app employs Bluetooth technology that allows smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, everyone with whom that person was in contact in previous days – within two metres of proximity for more than 15 minutes – is alerted via the app to isolate themselves and get tested. The Swiss authorities say the decentralised “SwissCovid” app is the first in the world to use the OS updates from Apple and Google.

2020-05-26;The UN at 75: What’s different, what’s the same?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva_the-un-at-75--what-s-different--what-s-the-same-/45783220;Do you know anyone who has never heard of the United Nations? Probably not. For most of the world’s population, the UN has been around our entire lives. But, do you know anyone who doesn’t really know what the UN does? The answer to that question is almost certainly a lot more ambivalent.  Some know it as the body which helps the most vulnerable in a crisis, some may have heard of disagreements and stalemates at the UN security council, others may think of the UN as a vast - bloated even - organisation which spreads its tentacles into too many aspects of life. All three are at least partially true, but none entirely accurate.  The United Nations was created on October 24, 1945 from the ashes, shock and slaughter of the Second World War. The solemn ceremony in San Francisco brought together just 51 nations, because large parts of the world were still colonised. With hindsight, it is understandable that countries which had fought so bitterly for six long years would want to come together to find multilateral ways of solving disagreements and tackling challenges. But the United Nations was, for its time, a surprisingly radical concept.  “75 years ago, the logic of setting up an international organisation like the United Nations was not necessarily obvious,” says historian and Professor of International Relations Mohamed Mahmoud Mohamedou. “The world was coming out of large-scale conflict, and the dynamics of multilateralism, the very concept of it, was not so well known.”  “But there was the realisation that this was the moment, if ever, to imagine a different type of world…this notion that you have one place where all of the nations with one equal vote can come together and debate the questions of the world.”  Fast forward 75 years, and the UN is embarking on the biggest survey ever undertaken, to find out what people think of the organisation and whether they think it needs change. Certainly, over the decades since 1945, the UN itself has changed. There are now 193 member states, among them many former colonies who gained independence in the 1950s and 1960s.  Masters student Jasmine Pokuaa Oduro-Bonsrah, who is studying at Geneva’s Graduate Institute, describes the UN as “a beast of an organization which impacts all our lives”. That’s not meant necessarily as a criticism, but she does think the UN needs to adapt to reflect its current membership.  “I think the structure of the UN itself needs to change. Clearly the member states are not happy with the current UN system. When the UN was created most of its members were still colonised. So the UN as it existed then, which still now has that same constitution, has not actually reflected the changes that have happened in the world. The member states now were not member states then.”  Why exactly are some member states not happy with the system? The reason goes back to that original concept, of all nations coming together with one equal vote. In fact, the UN structure is designed to make some more equal than others, and that, says Mohamedou, is a fatal flaw, built into the UN from the start.  “The UN Security Council (with five permanent, veto-holding members, the US, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom) is a snapshot of the political reality of 1945, it really is about the victors of WWII,” he says.  He points out that despite the world’s changes in the decades since, Germany for example does not sit on the Security Council, but France does. Important countries around the world such as India, Nigeria, or Brazil are also absent.  “It raises questions about why those particular five countries have a veto and a permanent seat on all of the matters that are crucial to the world,” Mohamedou notes. “It’s a fundamental problem that the UN has.”  The debate about reform of the Security Council has been going on for years, decades even, and has never found a solution. The P5, as the Security Council members are known, are not rushing to give up power, while the other member states cannot agree on how the power, were it ever to be spread around more generously, should be divvied up.  It’s a disappointing paralysis, one that is mirrored by paralysis at the Security Council itself. While the P5 may quietly agree to hang on to their permanent seats and their vetoes, they don’t often agree on much else.  Between them, the United States and China recently blocked a UN Security Council resolution on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, because the US wanted to explicitly name China as the source of the virus, and also objected to mention of the World Health Organization, which Washington says is too close to China. Meanwhile Beijing was uncomfortable with the mention of “transparency” in the resolution.  Such political posturing can have tragic consequences: the main point of the resolution was to back UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ call for a global ceasefire, to allow healthcare workers in places like Syria or Yemen to go about their work fighting Covid-19 without the risk of being shot or bombed.  The humanitarian arm of the United Nations, many of whose agencies are headquartered in Geneva, knows that posturing all too well. Time and again, from Syria, to Yemen, those big powers who came together in 1945 to create the UN, once described as “the world’s workshop for peace”, have been unable to deliver on their vision.  When Bernadette Castell-Hollingsworth, currently deputy director of International Protection at the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), was sent to Jordan in 2013 to set up Azraq camp for Syrian refugees, she didn’t believe that the war would still be going on seven long years later.  “Nobody could ever have thought that all these refugees, seven years later would still be in Jordan, or Lebanon,” she says. “I am still in contact with a woman in Azraq, she sent me pictures of her house in southern Syria, totally destroyed, and I felt she was losing hope.”  “In the UN we try not to lose hope, and I think our work is to stand by refugees for as long as they need us, but sometimes, doing this work you go through moments of doubt, and it’s sometimes difficult.”  So is there hope for the UN in its 75th year? Despite its many setbacks, divisions, and doubts, Mohamedou sees some bright spots for the organisation. During the 1990s, he points out, the UN forced an impressive list of issues onto the global agenda, ones that have now become key policy items for most governments.  “Right at the end of the Cold War, there was an opportunity for the UN to show whether it’s relevant or not,” he says, noting that the UN did step up with key world conferences such as  sustainable development in Rio in 1992, human rights in Vienna in 1993, population in Cairo in 1994, social development in Copenhagen in 1995 and the conference on women in Beijing, universal jurisdiction in Rome in 1998 and the Durban conference on racism in 2001.  Mohamedou sees that decade as evidence that the UN is capable of creating standards and norms for our planet, and of making sure the issues that affect us all, from climate to change to human rights and social justice, are addressed.  He sees dangers – but also possible opportunities – ahead.   “We have this multiplicity of rising nationalism, you could even speak of neo-authoritarianism in many places. In the US, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa,” he points out. “This is a crisis, but out of a crisis can come opportunity. If you combine this with the most recent crisis, the coronavirus pandemic, then you might have the conditions for new debate and new engagement. There could be an epiphany moment, a wake-up a call.”  Castell-Hollingsworth and Pokuaa Oduro-Bonsrah also believe the coronavirus pandemic ought to be a loud reminder that the world needs multilateralism, and by definition, the United Nations.    “Multilateralism, the one we have experienced over the last 75 years, may not always be perfect,” says the UNHCR deputy director. “But it is the solution to global issues. We are now experiencing a pandemic, and I believe it is only through multilateralism that we can address global issues like climate change, or displacement of people.” “We live in an interdependent world, and some member states’ governments who are tempted to think that they can find solutions on their own will be proven wrong, this is what history has shown us.” “My hope is that this UN at 75 will make changes,” says Oduro-Bonsrah. “I think right now we can see that it is in the best interests of countries to cooperate. It moves beyond the unilateral and single-minded thinking that this is not going to affect our countries.”  “It was a great wake-up call to see that no one is exempt from things that are happening in other parts of the world,” adds the Graduate Institute student. “It’s a shame that it had to take a pandemic to show that we need each other, but I believe this could be a great starting point to have a conversation about why we really require the help of each other.”Hear the latest episode of our Inside Geneva podcastExternal link, hosted by Imogen Foulkes, on the topic of the UN's past and future:  You can subscribe to more episodes of Inside Geneva hereExternal link, and follow Imogen Foulkes on twitter at @imogenfoulkes to send her questions and suggestions for Geneva-based topics.

2020-05-25;Poll: 70% of residents back ‘SwissCovid’ tracing app;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_poll--70--of-residents-back--swisscovid--tracing-app/45783230;A Swiss smartphone app that uses Apple-Google technology to help trace coronavirus infections has widespread support among the population, a new survey shows.  Around 70% of Swiss residents welcome the introduction of the decentralised contact tracing application DP-3T, according to a poll published on Monday by the research consultancy SotomoExternal link.  In all, 59% of the 2,819 people surveyed said they would install the “SwissCovid” app in the coming weeks. There were no big differences between age groups. From Monday, employees of the Swiss army, of several hospitals and cantonal administrations, and of federal technology institutes EPFL and ETH Zurich will be able to download and use the “SwissCovid” app on a voluntary basis, as part of a large-scale pilot phase in Switzerland.  The authorities hope that at least 60% of the general public will later adopt the app voluntarily alongside more traditional human tracing efforts. The Sotomo survey nonetheless revealed a number of challenges ahead. Data protection concerns were the main arguments for not downloading the app, followed by the need to permanently activate Bluetooth on your phone or worries about battery life. “But the problem is often not data protection in a strict technical sense but rather a general apprehension about freedoms being restricted,” the poll authors commented.  They also found that 54% of respondents were against a mandatory Covid tracing app. The idea that some employers, businesses or services might decide to impose the app raises much opposition, the poll said.  It added that while most people had heard of the contact tracing app, many were unfamiliar with its specific characteristics.  The DP-3T system is decentralised with contacts and data stored on devices rather than on an external server. The app employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days – within two metres of proximity for more than 15 minutes – are alerted via the app to isolate themselves and get tested. The Apple and Google tracing technology bars authorities using it to collect GPS location data or require users to enter personal data. The Swiss authorities say the “SwissCovid” app is the first in the world to use the OS updates from Apple and Google. Parliament will debate the legal bases for the app in June and if approved, it should be made available to the general public by mid-June.

2020-05-25;Swiss investigation launched into alleged ‘Covid credit’ fraud;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/corruption_swiss-investigation-launched-into-alleged--covid-credit--fraud/45782672;Prosecutors in western Switzerland have opened an investigation into suspected fraud and money laundering linked to financial aid given to several Swiss firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Around CHF1.5 million has allegedly been moved abroad.  The Office of the Attorney General of Canton Vaud opened an investigation last week involving several Swiss nationals, it was reported on Monday. Various bank accounts belonging to the suspects have been blocked. The suspects are alleged to have received Covid credits worth several million Swiss francs from various banks based on fraudulent statements.  Several companies, mainly small- and medium-sized enterprises, in different sectors of activity have been searched, Vaud prosecutor Anton Rüsch told the Keystone-SDA News Agency.  “Banks that granted Covid credits carried out checks. These revealed a number of suspicious elements which were notified to the Money Laundering Reporting Office SwitzerlandExternal link at the Federal Office of Police,” explained Rüsch. “Fedpol then carried out checks and as the doubts could not be cleared, it alerted the Vaud prosecutor’s office, which has taken charge of the affair.” The suspects are accused of using the money for other activities than the daily running of their businesses and of having transferred over CHF1.5 million abroad. Measures have been taken to repatriate the funds. The authorities however gave no further information on where the money was sent. A legal case has been opened for fraud, breach of trust, aggravated mismanagement, forgery, money laundering and breach of the Covid-19 Solidarity Guarantees OrderExternal link. The investigation, which focuses on the western Swiss canton only, continues. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-25;Government and tourism leaders discuss summer fun;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-and-travel_government-and-tourism-leaders-discuss-summer-fun/45782144;Despite the coronavirus, good – and local – summer vacation options are still a priority in Switzerland. “We have one big goal in common: we want there to be lovely, good and safe holidays in Switzerland this summer,” said Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga after Sunday’s meeting between government leaders and representatives of the tourism industry – which has been hard hit by Covid-19 restrictions. It was the second such meeting, following one in late April. The aim of this second meeting was to discuss the need for relaxing vacation options in Switzerland now that travel abroad is problematic. It also served to give the industry a certain degree of planning security. Swiss restaurants, museums and many other businesses have been allowed to welcome customers since May 11, provided that they have concepts to protect guests and employees from the virus. + Restaurants struggling to stay open From June 8, attractions like mountain railways, zoos, theatres and swimming pools can re-open. On Wednesday, the government will announce further measures related to the Swiss tourism sector. It is unclear when campgrounds can re-open and lake ferries can begin operating again. The Swiss government has earmarked CHF40 million ($41.1 million) to support the local tourism industry.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-24;Companies must pay share of rent for employees working from home;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/court-decision_companies-must-pay-share-of-rent-for-employees-working-from-home/45781126;German-language paper Tages-Anzeiger reports that Switzerland’s top court has ruled that employers are required to contribute to employees’ rent payments if they are expected to work from home. According to the paperExternal link, the federal court decision, which has not been made public, concerns an accounting firmExternal link that had let an employee work from home. The company argued that they had not reached an agreement with the employee ahead of time and therefore was not obligated to cover part of his rent. The court rejected this argument and added that the employee could even request rent compensation retroactively after leaving the company. Whether an employee did or did not rent an additional room or a larger apartment to work from home was also irrelevant according to the court’s ruling. The judges estimated a monthly compensation of CHF150 ($154) for the employee’s rent to be justified. This is the first time Switzerland’s highest court has dealt with the topic of rent allowances for employees working from home. Thomas Geiser, a professor of labor law at the University of St Gallen, told the paper that the verdict is not surprising as the “law obliges employers to reimburse their employees for all expenses incurred to carry out their work”. Geiser points out that the decision applies to employees who work from home upon the employer’s request. However, employees that work from home on their own behest may not receive rental compensation. For some trade union representatives this leaves out some workers, who may not be contractually obliged to work from home but may be driven to do so because of a range of reasons. Luca Cirigliano, General Secretary of the Swiss Confederation of Trade Unions, told the paper that companies often use flexible workstations in order to save money on office rent. It is extremely unfair as well as illegal for employers to pass costs on to employees in this way, Cirigliano told the paper. The decision comes during an unprecedented increase in working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some employers are exploring whether to extend flexible work arrangements and make “home office” a mainstay for some employees.

2020-05-24;How the Swiss have navigated crisis (mis)communication during Covid-19 ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-response-_how-the-swiss-have-navigated-crisis--mis-communication-during-covid-19--/45773636;"From red and pink posters in public squares to ministers’ frequent appearances on the nightly news, officials in Switzerland have worked hard to gain control of communication about the pandemic. Has effective messaging helped flatten the curve?  “We must act as quickly as possible but as slowly as necessary.”   It’s no accident that this statement by the minister responsible for health, Alain Berset, as he announced the government’s lockdown exit strategy in April landed not just on the pages of newspapers but also on a t-shirt sold to raise money for charity.   The message was a perfect example of the clear, measured and earnest tone that the country’s authorities have tried to strike publicly from the start of the coronavirus outbreak.  “It was received positively all over the country,” said Regula Hänggli Fricker, a professor of mass media and communicationExternal link at the University of Fribourg.   Clarity, consistency and transparency are all key ingredients of crisis communication, she added, “especially when trust is as important as [it is] in this pandemic”.  Indications so far are that the government has gained effective control of communication during the pandemic. Public trust in government reached over 60%, according to a recent poll, and the decline in the number of new cases has allowed the country to pursue a gradual easing of confinement measures.  Yet, at the start of the pandemic, it appeared as if the odds were stacked against the country and any response its leaders might muster. Switzerland, densely populated and sharing a border with Italy, one of the epicentres of the pandemic in Europe, quickly became one of the places most affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.   When it announced measures to fight the virus, the government put the onus on individuals to adhere to them. Staying at home was a recommendation, not a requirement. Messaging would need to be convincing for its strategy to work – not a minor task for a federalist state governed by seven ministers from four different parties taking on the country’s biggest crisis since the Second World War.  Mere months before the novel coronavirus became headline news, a comprehensive report found that no single country was fully prepared to face a pandemic. The Global Health Security IndexExternal link, which assessed countries based on several indicators, ranked Switzerland 13th out of 195 states in its preparation.   The Alpine nation scored well (67 out of 100) for response: in addition to a 128-page influenza pandemic response planExternal link, it had “communications plans in place […] and they include clear descriptions of roles and responsibilities”.  In other words, the basic groundwork for crisis communication was already laid when the first case of Covid-19 was reported on February 25. Earlier that month, the federal government’s spokesperson, André Simonazzi, had even created a Covid-19 communications taskforce to coordinate messaging among all the departments.   Until the first case was reported, information regarding the virus was issued by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Afterwards, official communication moved to the Federal Council, Switzerland’s cabinet. With an outbreak now imminent, the public needed not just scientific information, Simonazzi said, but to hear from its leaders about how the country would respond.   “From the start, the government’s main goal has been to protect the population against the coronavirus,” the spokesperson added. Authorities shared information about the virus through a variety of channels, from a dedicated websiteExternal link to social mediaExternal link.     By February 28, the government was acting under the terms of the Epidemics Act for the first time, which allowed it to limit some of the powers of the 26 cantons, which are responsible for health matters, and introduce far-reaching measures, including banning large gatherings.   With unprecedented measures in place to fight the virus, the government decided against making social distancing measures like staying at home a requirement, as neighbouring countries like France and Italy had done.  Andreas Ladner, a professor of communication and public opinionExternal link at the University of Lausanne, said it was Switzerland’s way of telling the public, “we’re counting on you”.  “It’s about making people part of the solution to the problem.”    Hänggli Fricker of the Univerity of Fribourg singles out the solidarity campaign “Wir/Nous/Noi/Nus”External link (“we” in the four national languages) as a particular success.  “One important aspect was the feeling of ‘we are all in this together’ when the ‘extraordinary situation’ was declared [on March 16],” she said, adding that President Simonetta Sommaruga made a point of expressing the government’s support as she appealed to everyone to follow the measures.  Somewhat surprisingly, the government chose to communicate through all seven cabinet ministers, plus an array of experts in public health, economics and border management, among others.  Those were risky strategies, according to Ladner.  “It’s not what you usually read about crisis communication, where you try to channel communication because you’re afraid of people contradicting each other,” he said.  Between February 28 and May 20, the Federal Chancellery held 46 press conferences about the coronavirus – just under half of them consisting of government ministers and the rest featuring experts, and all of them live-streamed. The method, according to Ladner, appears to be for each expert and minister “to stay close to what they know and what the truth is”.  “The press conferences seem straightforward [and about] providing information honestly,” he added. “It’s not a show they organised.”  The ministers and experts have also made regular appearances on one of the most popular sources of information for many Swiss – evening news programmes on public television channels. Consumption of online news media went up as the pandemic hit in March; major outlets like Le Temps and the Neue Zürcher Zeitung  saw traffic doubleExternal link.  But avoiding contradictions and inconsistencies was nearly impossible given that much about the virus is still unknown.  “In the case of the role of children [in spreading the virus], the wearing of masks, the gradual easing of measures, and short-time work – there were uncertainties,” Hänggli Fricker said. “But even though these uncertainties occur, the government sticks to what has been communicated before.”  Re-opening schools after eight weeks of remote learning was a controversial decision. The scientific evidence that children are not important vectors of Covid-19, as officials claimed, was still emerging and did not appear to convince all parents. Yet the government remained steadfast in its decision to send children back to school. Its delegate on the pandemic, Daniel Koch, reiterated assurances that the risk of children spreading the virus was low.  “If they say you can start school, they have to get people to believe it’s doable,” said Ladner. “To say we don’t know is not a good strategy in the long term.” The authorities have also shown a willingness to admit mistakes and clarify their position, according to Hänggli Fricker. Justice minister Karin Keller-Sutter, for example, conceded she and her colleagues bungled announcements about when restaurants and bars could re-open. These establishments were not part of the original lockdown exit strategy, a move the government later had to revise. Inconsistencies also appeared in the number of new cases reported early in the pandemic by the federal authorities and the cantons.   “The lack of uniform data systems led to problems in communication,” Hänggli Fricker said, adding that this should be a lesson learned.  Different counting methods aside, the Federal Chancellery tried to coordinate the government’s messages with the cantons, according to Simonazzi. The actors were already familiar with the approach: since 2015 they have all taken part in yearly crisis communications workshops.  “Federalism is a chance,” said Andreas Ladner. For the most part, the system has made good use of the traditions of debate, consensus and unity to find solutions for the cantons, some of which have been more seriously affected by the virus than others.  The federal ministers also made a point of commending the whole population and trying to unify the country – it was thanks to people’s discipline, they said in April, that hospitals had not been overwhelmed and the country could plan the re-opening of schools and businesses.   Nevertheless, messages have sometimes gotten crossed. Early in the crisis the small canton of Uri ordered people over 65 to stay at home, and canton Ticino, then the region with the highest number of coronavirus cases, decided to shut factories and production lines temporarily. None of these measures appeared in the government’s Covid-19 ordinance.  Ladner, though, said authorities had other challenges to deal with, such as how to convince those living in cantons where comparatively few cases had emerged to adhere to lockdown measures.  Part of ensuring credibility and cooperation from the public is establishing the authorities as reliable sources of information on the virus.   Daniel Koch, the head of infectious diseases at the public health office and Covid-19 delegate, has appeared frequently before the media to provide updates on the situation. His unruffled, measured tone and medical background earned him early praise in the media, even if he has faced tough questioning on issues like wearing masks and the role of children – topics that continue to divide the Swiss population. The government also appointed a scientific task force to offer evidence-based advice and analysis. And it called on various federal department officials to appear at press conferences to detail measures ranging from border controls to deploying the army to support health care workers. Communications teams have also gone after online misinformation, responding each time rumours or false claims make the rounds or even appear in the news media, according to Simonazzi, who has posted several tweets to denounce Covid-19 disinformation. Despite all of these efforts, however, there is one small segment of the population officials have not managed to convince: the hundreds in cities like Zurich and Bern who have protested in recent weeks against the government's measures. But as one expert, Sebastian Dieguez, told swissinfo.ch, demonstrators who trade in conspiracy theories will not change their minds, no matter what the government says or does. The majority of the Swiss, though, appear to have largely followed the government recommendation to stay home during the lockdown, the data shows. But without a thorough analysis, both Hänggli Fricker and Ladner said it was difficult to know for sure if effective messaging has helped to flatten the curve. They did agree that overall, the communication strategy appears to have been a good one.  “It’s been quite a complex situation and they’ve managed to cope well,” said Ladner.  The key now is for the government to accompany the public in the relaxation of measures, “keeping in mind there is still a danger [in new cases emerging] but showing they are observing the situation.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-23;China flexes its muscles at the UN;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/china-flexes-its-muscles-at-the-un/45688164;"Flaunting its role as a great power, China is wielding expanding influence in a United Nations weakened by the battering it has taken from the Trump administration. Its financial contributions are increasing, as are the number of leadership posts taken by Chinese nationals at the UN specialised agencies.  After visiting the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos and the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations in January 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping caused a sensation by positioning himself as the guarantor of the international order and the UN in a world that was shaken by the arrival of Donald Trump at the White House. China has taken advantage of the US president’s hostility towards the UN system to strengthen its positions. But could the coronavirus pandemic weaken China’s efforts at the UN? The global health crisis and its devastating economic impact nonetheless appear to have amplified the growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing. As the world’s second-biggest economy and its most important industrial centre, China has accounted for 30% of global economic growth up to 2019. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, it is also issuing loud and clear demands for its due position in the structures of the UN and making the most of the United States’ disengagement.  In 2019, Beijing became the second-biggest contributor, behind the US, to UN peace operations (15.21% of the 2019-2020 budget of $6.5 billion) and the 10th biggest supplier of peacekeepers (2,544 of 82,863). China is also the second-biggest contributor to the general budget of the UN ($337 million in 2020) after the US ($679 million in 2020). Beijing has secured sufficient international clout to get Chinese nationals elected to the top positions at four of the 15 UN specialised agencies; the International Civil Aviation Agency (ICAO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). By reaffirming the omnipotence of the Communist party in China’s leadership, Xi Jinping openly opposes western models of liberal democracy that respect civil liberties. In Geneva, this translates into a desire to influence the work of the UN Human Rights Council in a direction that is detrimental to defenders of human rights. At the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s special representative for human rights, Ms. Liu Hua, politely hammered home her government’s doctrine: “The experience in China shows that there is no single model for the protection of human rights and that modernisation doesn’t equate to westernisation. The protection of human rights must be embedded in a course of development that suits the individual conditions of a country.”  So those who highlight the repression of opposing voices in Hong Kong and the iron-fisted curbs on Muslims in the province of Xinjiang are asked to hold back their criticism. In the same statement on February 26, 2020, Ms. Liu Hua maintains that “there is no war, no displacement, no fear in the 9.6 million-square-kilometre Chinese territory and almost 1.4 billion people lead peaceful, free and happy lives – this is the biggest human rights project and it is the best practice in this field.” With its particularly intractable approach to the question of civil and political rights, Xi Jinping’s China is reinforcing a line of thought that did not disappear with the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Switzerland got a bitter taste of it in 1999 during a state visit by Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president at the time, who was infuriated at encountering militant pro-Tibet demonstrators on his arrival at the Federal Palace in the capital Bern. “You have lost a friend,” he told his hosts, who included Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss.

2020-05-22;Keep remittance channels open, urge Bern and London ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/helping-the-poor-_keep-remittance-channels-open--urge-bern-and-london-/45778754;Switzerland and the United Kingdom have launched a global appeal for migrant and diaspora remittance channels to be kept open despite Covid-19, to ensure vital income for the poorest communities around the world.  Because of the current coronavirus crisis, low-income countries have seen a dramatic fall in these remittances from abroad, said the Swiss foreign ministryExternal link.   Lockdown restrictions and the closure of foreign exchange and cash transfer agencies make it difficult, if not impossible, for migrant workers to send money home, and many agents currently lack the liquidity to continue operating, it explained.  Remittances are important, but difficult because of Covid-19. So let's make sure those barriers are removed worldwide!” said Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis. “New technologies can help us here.    The appeal launched on Friday aims to provide migrant workers with additional options, including digital technologies and digital channels, so they can continue to send money home. It calls on policymakers, regulators and service providers to make it easier to transfer money abroad. And it plans to “use information campaigns to raise migrants' awareness of new ways of sending money home, including digital transfer options”, according to the ministry press release.   It said that several countries had already joined the call for action, including Egypt, Ecuador, El Salvador, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan.  The appeal has been launched with the support of multilateral development organisations including the World Bank and International Organization for Migration, and private financial actors.  The joint appeal “highlights the close ties between Switzerland and the UK and demonstrates the strong working relationship between the two countries,” said the Swiss foreign ministry. “Switzerland has been working closely with the UK authorities in view of the country's withdrawal from the EU (Brexit) under the Federal Council's Mind the Gap strategy, which aims to maintain the current mutual rights and obligations between the two countries as far as possible.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Police made no arrests.  Mass gatherings are currently forbidden under government-imposed rules to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  + Covid-19 and the situation in Switzerland  The match, between teams from Lausanne and Yverdon, was held in the suburbs in a party atmosphere, the Swiss public broadcaster RTS reportedExternal link. Attendees were generally aged between 16 and 20 years old and had been alerted to the event on social media and messaging apps. It was not immediately clear whether professional or amateur players were involved, RTS said.  Police have started an investigation into who was responsible for organising the match. “It was deemed counterproductive and even dangerous for police to intervene given the number of people attending,” city police spokesman Antoine Golay told RTS.   He added that police did not, however, sanction this gathering. “We can see that part of the population don’t feel concerned by the pandemic,” Golay said.  The match took part in the northern part of the city. “We knew that something was brewing but we didn’t know the exact location. That made it hard to stop the game in advance,” the spokesman added.  The news comes as Switzerland gradually relaxes its lockdown measures and more people go out and about. On Saturday large crowds partied in Basel, drawing criticism, especially at the lack of police presence.   Hundreds of protestors have been joining demonstrations in some Swiss cities at the weekends over the lockdown.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The Appenzell assembly usually takes place on the last Sunday in April. This date had already been pushed back to August 23 due to the coronavirus lockdown.  + Coronavirus: the situation in Switzerland   On Friday, however, cantonal authoritiesExternal link said the assembly would be cancelled altogether this year, and that a normal ballot would be held to decide on the most important issues.  The head of the cantonal government, Roland Inauen, was quoted by the NZZExternal link newspaper as saying that “as far as we can see, in the last 200 to 300 years, the assembly has never had to be cancelled before”.  Restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus crisis include a ban on meetings of more than 1,000 people until the end of August. The canton could get an exception, but it would still have to ensure strict virus protection measures.  “This is particularly hard for gatherings of more than 1,000 people,” the canton said in a statement.   The protection measures would also change the character of the meeting, which includes a special church service and festivities.   The practice, which used to be more widespread across Switzerland, is not without its critics, who say that this form of democracy doesn’t fulfil the basic right to a secret ballot.

By this he meant daycare facilities, which were allotted CHF65 million ($67 million) by parliament to keep afloat. Rösti felt this could have been left to the cantons.  + Parliament approves funding for ‘forgotten’ sectors  A return to Swiss-style federalism, in which there is a balance of power between the national and cantonal (regional) authorities, was necessary, said Rösti. If there were to be a second wave of the coronavirus, cantons should be given far more leeway in the measures they take. “We can’t have another nationwide lockdown in Switzerland,” Rösti told the paper.   “Measures to stop the progression of the coronavirus were important and correct, but they should be chosen in such a way that the economy can continue to function,” he added.  Rösti is by no means the first person to criticise the balance of power during the crisis, although some experts think the cantons had too much autonomy at the start of the pandemic and that this slowed the country’s response down. Others have said it is key for the federal government to have flexibility in times of crisis.  Another view on sole federal government rule and Swiss democracy can be seen below.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

They are mostly drawn to the mountains and not to urban centres, according to the study published on Friday.    This means that cities like Geneva, Basel, and Bern, which are highly dependent on foreign tourists but are shunned by the Swiss, will be facing what Credit Suisse describes as a “difficult period”.   A notable exception is Zurich and the surrounding region, which is likely to see both tourist and business visits. As well as being an important business location, Zurich attracts many Swiss people for short stays because of its airport and its wide range of cultural activities, the study noted.   Meanwhile, Swiss International Airlines says it is expecting several difficult years as a result of the coronavirus. It does not expect to get back to revenue like last year’s until 2023, according to its commercial director Tamur Goudarzi.    Having cut its flight plan to a strict minimum during the Covid-19 crisis, SWISS will in June raise its capacities from 15% to 20%.  Goudarzi hopes to present a flight plan in the coming weeks that will increase capacity to 50% by the end of the year.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

This represented 80% of the revenue losses, H+ said.  + Swiss hospitals reportedly running out of money  Interior Minister Alain Berset, who holds the health portfolio for the government, said this week that elective surgeries had not been cancelled, only delayed. His remarks have been taken to mean that the government will not step in to plug the financial gap for hospitals, according to a report by the Swiss national broadcaster RTS.External link  Several cantons, while expecting that they would have to provide financial support, had hoped for some federal funding because it was the government that had ordered certain procedures stopped during the pandemic to free up care capacity for coronavirus patients.  H+ said it was calling for urgent national discussions to decide how costs will be covered. This is expected to take place after the summer.  “The loss is very high, this should cause reflection but also prompt the need to act quickly,” H+ director Anne-Geneviève Bütikofer,told RTS. Talks needed to be held, she said.   “It’s hard to imagine that we can catch up [on elective procedures] the next few weeks or months, because the infrastructure has not returned to running at its full capacity,” she said. “Hospitals are not fully up and running, patients are still cautious about coming back, hygiene measures still need to be followed, so we can’t go back to how we were before the pandemic.

One of the questions on the survey, which is aimed at around 200 customers, asks whether travellers would take the train more or less often if the company introduced cars in which wearing protective face masks was mandatory. Another question concerns a general obligation to wear masks. The survey has not yet provided any results, a Federal Railways spokersperson told news agency Keystone-SDA, confirming a report from the news site blick.ch. “We want to get a clear picture and a sense of what people’s concerns are,” he said. The Swiss transport workers’ union, SEV, says it is surprised by news of the initiative. “The Federal Railways have thought about their customers, but have they thought about their staff,” who must check tickets on all train cars, vice-president Barbara Spalinger told public radio SRF. Few passengers have been seen wearing masks since the return of normal services on May 11, and Federal Railways boss Vincent Ducrot has said more needs to be done to ensure compliance with safety measures.  The company, along with PostBus transport services, has in place a protection plan that includes recommendations for travellers to keep their distance from one another, to avoid rush hour travel and to wear face masks if a distance of two metres cannot be maintained. A recent poll revealed a majority of respondents are in favour of mandatory face masks on public transport.

2020-05-21;How Swiss police approach coronavirus crowd control;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-police-coronavirus-social-distancing/45772632;"The combination of fine spring weather and a wave of re-openings has lured many people back to parks, shops, bars and restaurants. Sometimes there are far too many, considering the Covid-19 restrictions limiting groups to five people and calling for two metres of space between individuals. + Covid-19 and the situation in Switzerland For example, large crowds partied for hours in Basel on Saturday night. The lack of police presence sparked criticism from many, including the bar that posted this video online: Boisterous crowding like that witnessed in Basel is a no-go as Swiss authorities try to prevent a second wave of the deadly virus. Yet the images of the partygoers didn’t surprise Urs Hofmann, head of the Conference of Swiss Cantonal Justice and Police Department Directors (CCDJP)External link. “With the re-opening of restaurants and the general relaxation of measures, the whole situation is no longer as manageable as before,” Hofmann told Swiss public television, SRFExternal link. “It’s a big challenge for the police to radically enforce the five-person group and two-metre distance rules in public places.” He calls on the public to be more disciplined. Baschi Dürr, Basel’s security director, has also appealed to people to be more careful when out in public. “The police will ramp up their control activities, within the scope of their powers. They cannot always be everywhere,” Dürr told SRFExternal link. If necessary, he said the city would implement stricter measures, like temporarily closing any hotspots where “there are simply too many people for the two-metre rule to be observed”. Last weekend there were no such scenes reported in Zurich, which has had 1,650 coronavirus-related police deployments in the past two months. These resulted in 600 fines – including to a couple holding hands in a park. As city security chief Karin Rykart told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) newspaperExternal link, the woman and man – who live together – were each fined CHF100 ($103) because they had failed to react when a police officer ordered everyone in the park to move apart. “Most people walk away or keep their distance,” Rykart told the NZZ. “Maybe there’s a situation that isn’t clear; that can be. But the police can’t hold a legal seminar with people on the street every time.” She said that in some cases areas simply have to be closed for a while – including popular parks. “In the city, public space is limited, and at the same time people are told that it’s OK to go outside, resulting in a lot of people in a small space,” Rykart said. Enforcing pandemic measures affects police nationwide. Considering how cantons and communities differ, the CCDJP’s Hofmann doesn’t think it makes sense to have a Swiss master plan for coronavirus crowd control. “It’s a complete illusion to think that it’s possible to set absolutely clear guidelines for all police forces. But it’s clear that the police officers are in constant communication with each other,” he said. A study of Switzerland’s police systemExternal link underlines the importance of local policing. “Cantonal and communal police forces are better able to assess the requirements to ensure the safety of the local communities. It is important that police officers as well as police commanders know and understand their environment as well as their communities and are capable of interacting with them,” wrote authors Sara Stocker and Lydia Amberg. Last weekend’s flouting of safety measures in Basel was regrettable, notes city security head Dürr. “It would be such a pity if everything we’ve achieved up until now was in vain. We continue to appeal to the people’s sense of personal responsibility.” With two long holiday weekends coming up this month, the police will likely be busier than most years.    This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-21;Why more women than men have got Covid-19 during lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/gender-equality_why-have-more-women-been-infected-by-covid-19-during-lockdown-/45770648;Data reveals that more women than men have been infected with Covid-19 since distancing measures started in Switzerland. What’s behind the phenomenon? When the coronavirus first started spreading throughout Switzerland, men represented a larger share of confirmed cases. The number of women infected started inching upwards to reach an even gender split by the time the lockdown went into effect on March 16. Then, as businesses and much of public life shut down over the weeks that followed, more women than men became infected with Covid-19. There were around 13,800 cases among men (46% of the total) and around 16,500 among women (54% of the total) by mid-May, according to Swiss public health statistics. A few other countries have seen a similar phenomenon. The German-language Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reportsExternal link that women represent 53% of cases in Italy, 52% in Germany and 57% in both Spain and Sweden. According to a policy briefExternal link released over the weekend by the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Task Force, one reason is that women are more exposed to the virus because they make up the majority of the healthcare workforce and those who care for the elderly. This also means that they are tested more often. Women are also more frequently found in jobs such as childcare and sales that cannot be done at home and where they come in direct contact with people. Women also represent the lion’s share of teachers, which could leave them at a higher risk of infection as the country's schools reopen.  The task force notes that women are also more likely to be working in lower-paid jobs, which means they may find it more difficult to demand protective equipment when it isn’t made available. And Helena Trachsel, head of canton Zurich's gender equality unit, noted in the Tages-Anzeiger that the higher number of women in part-time work in Switzerland, the second-highest in Europe, also means that they are more mobile, which could increase exposure. Catherine Gebhard, a gender medicine specialist at the University of Zurich, told the Tages-Anzeiger that more investigations are underway to understand gender differences in infection rates. At this point, she says that “social differences” appear to play a larger role than “biological ones”. It is however possible that biology plays a role in how men and women’s immune systems respond to the virus. Even with higher infection rates, serious illness is more common among men. Women have represented a stable 40-42% of coronavirus-related deaths in Switzerland over the course of the pandemic. Other countries such as China and the US report similar gender differences in death rates. Infection rates are not the only concern according to the task force. As prenatal care and childbirth services have become a lower priority as resources focused on Covid-19, midwives had more difficulty procuring protective equipment and decreased visits. The crisis has also been linked with a rise in domestic violence, as confinement and economic uncertainties place more stress on couples.  The task force notes that women are also disproportionately affected economically by the crisis because they are more often in precarious economic situations, spend more time on unpaid work and represent the majority of single-parent households. This means that “their capacity to absorb shocks is weaker than men . Homeschooling tasks are more likely to fall on mothers than fathers, which in turn reinforces the pressure on women as they try to maintain their careers, the task force said. At the same time, the group's research shows that new, more equal and less gendered work-home life arrangements are emerging out of the crisis. This includes fathers taking on more parenting duties during confinement. As the country looks ahead, the crisis may also lead to more openness to flexible work arrangements and teleworking that could have gender equality benefits, researchers said. The task force has put together a series of recommendations that take into account how the virus and the economic consequences of the lockdown affect men and women differently. The Federal Commission on Women’s Issues is also publishing a series of articlesExternal link on gender-related Covid-aspects, starting with the world of work.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-20;Government earmarks CHF300 million to secure Covid-19 vaccine ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/medical-supplies_government-earmarks-chf300-million-to-secure-covid-19-vaccine-/45774034;The Swiss government is setting aside funds to procure enough doses of a Covid-19 vaccine for the country’s 8.6 million population. “The goal is clear: The Swiss population should have the fastest possible access to a safe, effective vaccine,” asserted Health Minister Alain Berset in a press conference on Wednesday. He added that all countries should have fair access to a vaccine. The government has tasked the defense ministry with negotiating contracts with manufacturers to secure a Covid-19 vaccine and estimates it will cost CHF300 million ($310.82 million) to procure enough doses for everyone in the country. This amount is most likely to be covered by existing funds for the coronavirus response. The announcement comes amid fears that some countries may be left out when a vaccine is eventually approved and produced. Immunity among the Swiss population, as is in the case in other countries, will be very low following the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, worldwide demand for vaccines will be correspondingly high, the government noted in a statement. Concerns are mounting that some countries including the US could seek to hoard a successful vaccine candidate given manufacturing capacity is unlikely to meet demand when a vaccine is first approved for use. Earlier this week, there were reports the US would receive first doses of a potential vaccine developed by US firm Moderna, even though the ingredients are manufactured by Swiss firm LonzaExternal link. Berset indicated that the government is in touch with Lonza as well as other vaccine manufacturers but that there are more than 100 projects underway, including some in SwitzerlandExternal link, making it difficult to know which efforts will be successful in the end. “It is not a question of money,” said Berset. He noted no single country manufacturers a vaccine from start to finish but rather that parts are often produced in many different locations. Ultimately, countries are interested in a finished vaccine, not a preliminary product, which doesn’t make negotiations easy, according to the government statement. Infectious disease head Daniel Koch told reporters that it is not the first time that Switzerland tries to secure or reserve a vaccine. “It is worldwide always the same principle. One negotiates with vaccine manufacturers whenever possible,” he said. Koch added that through their contracts with countries, manufacturers ensure that it isn’t just one country that receives all of a vaccine and other countries receive nothing. He added that Switzerland also works with the World Health Organisation to ensure fair access. “This worked well during vaccines for other pandemics and I’m confident that this will work well this time,” he told the press.

2020-05-20;Government provides legal basis for SwissCovid contact tracing app ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/control-the-spread_government-provides-legal-basis-for-contract-tracing-app-swisscovid/45773566;The Swiss government has adopted the legal foundation for the coronavirus contact tracing app, sending it to parliament for a vote. If approved, the app will be available before the end of June. The new contact tracing app will be called SwissCovid, according to the government, which on Wednesday announced that it was proposing amending the Epidemics Act to allow the Federal Office of Public Health to operate the proximity tracing system. Parliament will now vote on the proposal during its June session. The contact tracing app is intended to contain the spread of the coronavirus by alerting users when they have been in contact with infected people. Switzerland’s two federal technology institutes – ETH Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne – have developed the app and have been piloting it since mid-May. The app, which people can voluntarily download and use, employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. While contact tracing apps like this have been touted as a critical part of controlling the spread of the virus, critics warn of data privacy concerns, which prompted the Swiss parliament to demand a legal basis for such an app.  The government sought to assuage concerns on Wednesday, indicating that data processed by the application would be used only to inform people who have the potential of being exposed to the virus. The government also guarantees data protection at all times and that personal privacy will be respected. In a statement, the government indicated that the information would be stored in a decentralised manner and the system would not record one’s location. In addition, the technical specifications and source code would be publicly available. SwissCovid is intended to complement the tracking already carried out by individual cantons. Its use is optional and there will be no preferential treatment or disadvantages for those who do or don’t use the system. The application will be deactivated as soon as it is no longer required for coronavirus control. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-20;Coronavirus travel restrictions derail smuggling activities;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-impacts_coronavirus-travel-restrictions-derail-smuggling-activities/45773070;Travel restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus have led to a major drop in cross-border smuggling activity, as well as in illegal entries and stays in Switzerland, according to customs authorities. Smuggling activity decreased by 67% in early 2020 compared to the same period last year, the Federal Customs Administration announced on Wednesday. Between January and April this year, there have been 94 cases of smuggling, compared to 140 cases in the first four months of 2019. The sharp decline began after the announcement of travel restrictions in March. In April, border guards, reinforced by the military, registered ten suspected cases of smuggling. In the same month last year there were 31. Entry controls and restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have also reduced the number of illegal entries and stays in Switzerland. The customs office recorded a nearly 80% drop in illegal entry cases for April. There were 517 and 217 illegal entries recorded in March and April respectively. In comparison, some 1,116 cases were recorded in April last year. Illegal stays have fallen by about half. The customs authority documented 2,830 cases in early 2020 compared to 4,598 cases between January and April 2019. Last month, Swiss border guards handed over 63 persons who had illegally entered Switzerland to foreign authorities. That compares to 466 handovers in April 2019. Switzerland shares a border with Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, Liechtenstein and Austria to the east. The Alpine nation is part of the Schengen area.

2020-05-19;EU pandemic resolution adopted at World Health Assembly;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-wha73_eu-pandemic-resolution-adopted-at-world-health-assembly/45771122;World Health Organization (WHO) member states have endorsed a key European Union resolution that calls for fair access to coronavirus vaccines and treatments, and a review of WHO’s handling of the pandemic.  At a virtual meeting of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, none of the 194 member states – including the United States - raised objections on Tuesday to the resolution External linktabled by the EU on behalf of 140 countries, including China and Japan. The resolution encourages the global health community to work closer together to ensure wide and equitable access worldwide to Covid-19 medicines and vaccines. The text urges states to collaborate to develop treatments and vaccines via “voluntary pooling and licensing of patents to facilitate timely, equitable and affordable access to them”. It also calls for an independent evaluation of the WHO's performance as soon as possible. Ahead of the vote, the Federal Office for Public Health told swissinfo.ch that Switzerland - home to pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis – had participated actively in the lengthy negotiations and accepted the draft.  “Switzerland is committed to a coordinated and united international response to overcome the current crisis,” said spokesperson Daniel Dauwalder. China previously opposed calls for a review of the origin and spread of the coronavirus, but China's President Xi Jinping signalled on Monday that Beijing would accept an impartial evaluation of the global response, once the pandemic is under control. In a statement issued just after the text was adopted, the US said the resolution was “an important contribution” to the global pandemic response. It also welcomed the call for a review of the WHO’s response to ensure “a complete and transparent understanding of the source of the virus, timeline of events, early discussions, and the decision-making process for the WHO’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic”. While it did not block the consensus resolution, the US said it dissociates itself from paragraphs guaranteeing the rights of poor countries to waive intellectual property rules to obtain medicines in an emergency and guaranteeing reproductive and sexual healthcare in the pandemic.  Overnight US President Donald Trump, who has accused the WHO of backing China, ratcheted up the pressure by tweeting a letter threatening to quit the Geneva-based UN health body and permanently halt funding unless it commits within 30 days to reforms. During the virtual assembly, many member states expressed support for the WHO. On Monday in her opening address Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga pledged her country's full support and cooperation to its leader. Director-General as you go through this crisis be assured that you have the Switzerland's full support and cooperation, said the Swiss president, while urging member states to act together in the crisis.

2020-05-19;The latest updates on Swiss and international democracy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/newsletter_the-latest-updates-on-swiss-and-international-democracy/45771058;"The lockdown is lifting, but this hasn’t stopped protests against the government’s Covid-19 restrictions. Legitimate democratic dissenters or conspiracy theorists? Here are the latest direct democracy updates from Switzerland. For three weekends running, protestors have taken to the streets of Bern and other Swiss cities to contest the lockdown rules and restricted rights put in place – this despite the fact that as of last Monday, shops, restaurants, and schools in the country are back open. What do they want? For some it’s about democratic rights: the government has encroached too far on individual freedom and it’s time to fight back. Others, perhaps unfortunately for the legitimacy of the event, have more leftfield worries about vaccination and 5G. With the protests set to continue, it’s an interesting time to ask what amounts to legitimate resistance, and what amounts to illegal disruption in a modern democracy. Meanwhile, with the country brought to a standstill and people getting used to Zoom and Skype etc., the issue of technology and politics – “digital democracy” – is back on the table. Some have criticised the fact that parliament was unable to meet during the initial months of the lockdown due to social distancing rules; couldn’t they have done so online? The issue of e-collecting for signatures and e-voting have also raised their heads again. One thing is sure: with the social distancing rules continuing to operate for the foreseeable future, and with a big vote coming up in Switzerland in September, the issue of online campaigning and tech’s influence on politics is not going away soon. As we literally live through history, some journalists have been looking back to previous moments in history when epidemics have rocked Switzerland and the world. Such disruption is always liable to bring some sort of change about, whether positive or negative; and for democracy, this is even more so the case as the crisis lays bare inequalities and problems in society that we may not have been aware of before. What will the upshot of Covid-19 be on democracies, in Switzerland and internationally? Beyond the inevitable economic recession, are we going to see big political changes coming over the horizon? What can history teach us about this? Internationally, finally, the pandemic has dramatically changed the context for participatory and direct democracy around the world this spring. While Switzerland postponed its May 17 popular votes to a new voting day in September, more than 56 countries globally have also cancelled or postponed elections and referendums; including a vote on abortion in Gibraltar and a constitutional vote in Italy. But participatory and direct democracy is not paused everywhere: in 23 jurisdictions signature gathering and ballot voting has been allowed to go ahead including constitutional referendums in Guinea and Benin. Is there anything else you’d like to hear about from the world of direct democracy?

2020-05-19;Calls for elderly care homes to be better prepared for pandemics;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-deaths_calls-for-elderly-care-homes-to-be-better-prepared-for-pandemics/45770288;Experts have called for better national coordination to protect the elderly in care homes from future pandemics. A newspaper reports that more than half the Covid-19 deaths originated from infections within such establishments. A Tages AnzeigerExternal link survey found that 53% of all people who died as a result of coronavirus infection were care home residents. The results varied from canton to canton, with Zurich, Basel City and Vaud reporting a care home death rate of at least 60% with the figure dropping to 41% in Geneva. As only a handful of cantons recorded deaths of residents after they were transferred to hospital, as opposed to dying at care homes, the proportion of care home-related deaths may actually be higher the report concludes. Looking at the available statistics, the newspaper reports that the rate of Swiss care home deaths is comparable to Sweden and Britain, where the subject has led to much criticism. Of the 4,065 infections reported in the over-80 age group nationwide, more than a quarter succumbed to the disease that proved particularly fatal among the elderly. The CuravivaExternal link national association of retirement and nursing homes complained of a shortage of essential protection materials available to care homes. “Considering the possibility of a second wave, a national protection concept is now needed that applies to all homes and sets clear rules,” said Andreas Stuck, president of the Swiss Geriatric SocietyExternal link. This should include guidelines on how to isolate infected residents, training staff to deal with viruses and establishing clear lines of responsibility in managing epidemics. But Rudolf Hauri, president of the Association of Cantonal Physicians, cautioned against a knee-jerk reaction. “It is inappropriate to speak of older people being sacrificed in Switzerland,” he said. He added that the authorities had taken measures to protect the vulnerable age group and that Covid-19 may not have been the sole cause of death for those that were already chronically or terminally ill.

2020-05-19;How Swiss grandparents are handling coronavirus restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-and-families_coronavirus-reveals-high-social-status-of-grandparents/45768310;"Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again, but they’re still not advised to look after them, says the Swiss health authority managing the coronavirus crisis. The contradiction is unsettling for families in Switzerland, and highlights the key role of grandparents in the country. In canton Bern, 62-year-old Heidi Klossner Biglen was delighted to receive official permission to hug her grandchildren again. She and her husband normally look after them two days a month. They recently met for the first time in two months – with joy and a little uncertainty, as the grandchildren had gotten used to keeping a distance. For Klossner Biglen, time spent with her grandchildren is a chance to watch them grow up and to share life experiences. “We learn from them and they learn from us,” she says. Grandmother Barbara Müller*, 63, has been looking after her grandson again for over a week now. She felt liberated when Daniel Koch, the government delegate on the Covid-19 pandemic, said it was OK to hug grandchildren again. It was social pressure that had pushed her to stop babysitting. “I know lots of grandparents and none of them are looking after their grandchildren; it’s become a no-go,” she says. Walking around, she notices that grandparents with children have disappeared from public places. The coronavirus crisis shows the high social standing of grandparents in Switzerland. Financially, they play an important role: the annual value of unpaid childcare provided by grandparents is estimated at around CHF8 billion ($8.2 billion). Hugging, yes – babysitting, no: Koch’s announcement made international news and was met with criticism. Among other things, the Swiss authorities are basing this position on a studyExternal link that found that small children in particular have very few docking points in the throat and pharynx through which the virus can enter the body. Children therefore rarely contract the new coronavirus, according to the study. Koch wanted to provide relief for suffering grandparents and grandchildren, as the health office told SWI swissinfo.ch. He weighed up the risk of infection against the psychological stress experienced by grandparents, and concluded that hugs were justifiable in view of the relatively low risk of infection. “It’s really a quick hug, just a squeeze,” said a spokeswoman for the health office, which continues to advise against babysitting or longer visits. This is not the case in all countries, with recommendations varied across the world. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been hearing from grandparents who miss their grandchildren very much,” said Geraldine Capaul, editor-in-chief of a magazine for grandparentsExternal link – which was the first to publish Koch’s statement in an interview.  “On a regular basis, many grandparents look after their grandchildren for whole days. With this intervention they suddenly don’t see them at all. It hurts,” said Capaul. She notes that some people would prefer to ignore the measures imposed by the Swiss government, arguing that considering their limited lifespans, they don’t want to be spending even less time with their grandchildren. The Swiss authorities have no information on whether grandparents are actually complying with the “babysitting ban”. Sociologist François HöpflingerExternal link told SWI swissinfo.ch said that the vast majority of grandparents have so far followed the recommendations, as the situation has been perceived as temporary. “At the moment – with the easing of the ‘lockdown’ – there is great uncertainty,” Höpflinger said. “Bans on contact can be endured in the short term, but in the longer term they meet with resistance, especially from healthy and active grandparents.” According to Höpflinger, contact between grandparents and grandchildren in Europe has increased in recent years. What is special for Switzerland, however, is that considerably fewer grandparents live in the same household with their grandchildren. In prosperous Switzerland, where retirement provisions are comparatively good, only 1.1% of all private households are three-generation homes. The figure is 5.7% in Japan and 16.5% in China. As in other western and northern European countries, Switzerland has had a long tradition of generations living separately. According to Höpflinger, living apart but maintaining good relationships is common in Switzerland – something he calls “the principle of intimacy at a distance”. On one hand, this is a bad thing, because grandparents living in separate households miss their grandchildren. But it’s also good news in Switzerland, unlike in Italy, where a studyExternal link found that coronavirus was especially deadly because there are so many multi-generation households. The pandemic has also shaken Swiss society. It has shown how important family ties are – and how bad it can be if relatives can’t see each other. It’s quite possible that generations will come closer together and show more solidarity when the crisis subsides. *name has been changed This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-18;Only 10% of Swiss are immune to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_only-10--of-swiss-are-immune-to-covid-19/45768452;One in ten Swiss residents has developed immunity to the new coronavirus, according to a top Swiss health official. Meanwhile, federal statistics reveal a sharp downward trend in corona-related infections and deaths.  “There will be no herd immunity in Switzerland during this first wave, as the coronavirus infection rate stands at only 10%,” Daniel Koch, head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), told reporters on Monday. Koch was referring to an ongoing herd community study External linkbeing carried out in canton Geneva that estimates the seroprevalence of the population and estimated percentage exposed to the virus. The number of coronavirus cases has fallen steeply in Switzerland in recent days. On Monday, the FOPH reported only ten new official confirmed cases of infection, taking the total number of confirmed cases to over 30,000. There were also no new coronavirus deaths in Switzerland over the previous 72 hours, FOPH statistics revealedExternal link. There have been a total of 1,883 reported deaths. Koch described the downward trend as “extremely pleasing”, adding that “everything is on track”. He said there were various reasons behind the fall: the behaviour of the population, the strict rules and seasonal factors. “The numbers continue to go down. We hope there will be even fewer cases and infections in Switzerland. As a result, this will allow us to continue to ease restrictive measures,” he said.  Koch said the population should be able to enjoy the upcoming Ascension and Whitsun holiday weekends. But he insisted that residents should maintain social distancing and hygiene rules.  The government-imposed “emergency situation” and restrictions continue in Switzerland. All private and public events are banned, as are gatherings of more than five people.  But a three-stage plan to ease measures and to slowly re-open the country is underway. This includes plans to re-open Switzerland’s borders with Germany, Austria and France on June 15, if the situation allows.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-18;Top pharma official rejects idea of free Covid-19 vaccine for all;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-vaccine_top-pharma-official-rejects-idea-of-free-covid-19-vaccine-for-all/45767998;"A leading representative of the pharmaceutical industry has downplayed the idea of a vaccine against the new coronavirus that is “free for all” when available.  In Switzerland, where the health system works well, it doesn’t make sense to have access to a free vaccine, Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), told reporters in a virtual briefing on Monday.  Cueni said he shared the objective of fair, widespread and low-cost access to products around the world. But he said a global distribution system piloted by the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) was needed to lower prices in poorer countries. “I would expect countries like Switzerland to show solidarity and a willingness to pay a bit more than other countries, where I hope patients can get free vaccines,” he said. “This is a lot more realistic than to say everyone should have access to free vaccines.”  Cueni made the comments as health ministers from around the world were taking part in a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body. During the two-day session states will vote on an EU resolution that calls for “universal, timely and equitable access” to Covid-19 treatments and vaccines against the disease. In a parallel initiative, around 150 world leaders and experts signed an open letterExternal link urging health ministers at the event to rally behind a “people’s vaccine” made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge without patent restrictions. Scientists are rushing to find treatments and vaccines for a disease that has killed over 310,000 people worldwide. More than 120 vaccines are currently being developed globally, with eight in the clinical trial phase. But experts say the process could take years and may not happen at all.  Cueni estimates it will take a year before a vaccine can be mass produced. But when it is ready, not everyone will be able to get it straight away; health workers will be first in line, he added.  The IFPMA is a partner of a major initiative launched earlier this month by the EU, Britain, Norway, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia – but without the United States – which raised $8 billion (CHF7.7 billion) in pledges for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.

2020-05-18;Covid-19 to dominate ‘unprecedented’ virtual World Health Assembly;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-wha73_covid-19-to-dominate--unprecedented--virtual-world-health-assembly/45763494;In a historic first, health officials will be logging in on Monday for a two-day online World Health Assembly (WHA), devoted largely to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fair access to vaccines and treatments, and an independent evaluation of WHO's response to the pandemic are set to dominate proceedings amid corona tensions.  Instead of meeting for ten days in a huge conference hall at the United Nations Palais des Nations in Geneva, the pandemic means that government health officials and experts from 194 member states will be joining a virtual abbreviated version of the annual event.  “Covid-19 has had a tremendous effect on the governance of the UN system, even the Security Council is working remotely,” Geneva Graduate Institute Professor Gian Luca BurciExternal link, former chief WHO legal advisor, told a briefing last week. “The International Labour Conference will not meet this year, but obviously the World Health Organization has to meet to send a strong signal on Covid-19 and to continue to provide essential institutional duties.” The streamlined agenda includes a handful of VIP speakers and votes for key WHO posts like executive board members. But coronavirus will overshadow the decision-making body’s proceedings, webcast live. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ track record and background is sure to come under renewed scrutiny when he gives a statement on the global pandemic response. Over 4.6 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and over 310,000 have died. Many health policy experts have praised Tedros’ handling of the outbreak. But the Trump administration has lambasted the WHO for being slow to react to the outbreak and for being China-centric . US officials last month announced a suspension of funding to the international health body.  Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga opened the assembly on Monday, pledging her country's full support and cooperation to its leader. Director-General as you go through this crisis be assured that you have the Switzerland's full support and cooperation, said the Swiss president, while urging member states to act together in the crisis. In perhaps the highlight of the 73rd WHA, health ministers will debate and vote on a draft European Union resolution on the Covid-19 response. States have reportedly reached an initial agreement after days of intense negotiations. Switzerland, which is home to pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis, participated actively in the negotiations. “We accept the draft,” Daniel Dauwalder, spokesperson for the Federal Office for Public Health, told swissinfo.ch. “Switzerland is committed to a coordinated and united international response to overcome the current crisis.”  Calling for unity and solidarity, the agreed-upon draft seen by Health Policy WatchExternal link recalls WHO’s lead role and encourages the global health community to work closer together to ensure wide and equitable access worldwide to Covid-19 medicines and vaccines. The US had reportedly objected to parts of the plan, but references to “universal, timely and equitable access” to Covid-19 treatments and vaccines, which had apparently been problematic, appear to remain. But it is unclear whether the US will support it when it comes to a vote by consensus at the plenary session. The resolution urges states to work together to develop treatments and vaccines via “voluntary pooling and licensing of patents to facilitate timely, equitable and affordable access to them”. This builds on an initiative launched earlier this month by the EU, Britain, Norway, Japan, Canada, and Saudi Arabia – without the US – which raised $8 billion (CHF7.7 billion) in pledges for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The text adds that such efforts should be consistent with existing “TRIPS flexibilitiesExternal link” – the legal World Trade Organization (WTO) framework that allows countries to legally override patent laws when a national or international health interest is at stake. In a parallel initiative, around 150 world leaders and experts, including former Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss, signed an open letterExternal link urging health ministers at the WHA to rally behind a “people’s vaccine” without patent restrictions. But the fair distribution of vaccines and treatments remains a huge challenge, as shown by the recent political storm in France with the Paris-based pharma company Sanofi. Last week CEO Paul Hudson told the Bloomberg news agency that the US government had the right to the largest pre-order of an eventual Covid-19 vaccine “because it’s invested in taking the risk”. But Sanofi later appeared to backtrack, stating that they “have always been committed in these unprecedented circumstances to make our vaccine accessible to everyone.”  The draft resolution also calls for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO-coordinated international response to Covid-19 “at the earliest appropriate moment”. This is something the US has been calling for and which reportedly has wide state support. Another sensitive issue in the run-up to the WHA has been Taiwan. The island, with the strong support of the US, stepped up its lobbying to be allowed to take part as an observer at the WHA, saying that to lock it out was to create a gap in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. This raised objections from China, which considers Taiwan one of its provinces. Thirteen member states recently submitted a proposal to support Taiwan’s participation. China viewed the move as an open slight and there were fears in Geneva that the virtual meeting might get bogged down in political wrangling.  Taiwan attended the WHA as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects. The WHO, meanwhile, said it has no mandate to invite Taiwan to the WHA and that only member states could decide. However, despite strong efforts Taiwan did not get invited to the WHA due to Chinese pressure, its foreign minister said on Monday, adding they had agreed to put the issueoff until later this year. “This is an unprecedented WHA,” declared Suerie MoonExternal link, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Geneva Graduate Institute.  “WHO is in the public eye as it has never been before, but it is also under fire like perhaps never before… It’s clear that this is a moment to think beyond business and politics as usual and for the WHA it will be a test to see if that’s at all possible.

2020-05-17;Minister calls for extra funds for Swiss unemployment system;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parmelin_minister-calls-for-extra-funds-for-swiss-unemployment-system/45765814;Economics Minister Guy Parmelin says it is crucial to end the lockdown and prevent a collapse of the unemployment scheme to ensure Switzerland’s economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Parmelin said the government would decide on an injection of additional funds into the state unemployment scheme at one of its next meetings. Failure to do so would lead to lower purchasing power, he warned. Unemployment is currently at 3.3% in Switzerland and it is expected to rise to 4.1% according to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. About 30% of the workforce have applied for short-time work compensation following a partial shutdown of business activities.  Parmelin also called for publicly financed infrastructure projects to be speeded up and stressed the importance of free trade agreements with other countries to give the Swiss industry access to international markets. “This is key in when multilateral organisations are blocked and the United States resort to a go-it alone policy,” he told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper. Parmelin dismissed calls notably from the political left for a stimulus package but came out in favour of scrapping industrial tariffs to promote consumption and lower prices, notably for export-oriented businesses. “But let’s be honest: The size of the economic crisis depends on the international developments,” he said. Parliament approved a relief package worth more than CHF57 billion ($58.6 billion) for the Swiss economy earlier this month to cushion the shock of the lockdown imposed in March. Parmelin reiterated the importance of coordinated international efforts in times of crisis and came out against a proposal by the right-wing People’s Party to end an accord with the European Union on the free movement of labour. “The government, including myself, are against the initiative because it would undermine our economy,” he said.

2020-05-16;Anti-lockdown rallies stopped at early stage;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/police-intervention_anti-lockdown-rallies-stopped-at-early-stage/45765040;Police have broken up renewed protests in several Swiss cities against coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Several hundred participants of all ages took part in the demonstrations in Zurich, Bern, Basel and Winterthur on Saturday. Observers have described the crowds as a mix of civil rights campaigners, anti-state protestors and followers of esoteric views. Several people were arrested or taken away for questioning by police. The protestors called for an end to the ban on public gatherings introduced by government in mid-March as part of measures to prevent the spread of infectious Covd-19 virus. Police in Bern cordoned off parliament square – a popular site for public rallies. It also intervened to block a protest on the outskirts of the city. Anti-lockdown demonstrations have increased notably in the main German-speaking part of the country since the beginning of May amid criticism of inconsistent police intervention. The demonstrations come amid calls by opinion leaders for the government to re-instate full public rights in Switzerland, but respecting the health precautions, notably hygiene and the stay 2-metre distance rules.

Twenty-three unaccompanied minors, who have family living in Switzerland, landed at Zurich airport on Saturday according the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). The group is made up of 18 boys and five girls aged between ten and 17. They originate from Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, a SEM statementExternal link said. They will be quarantined for two weeks to avoid the risk of spreading coronavirus before they are transferred to an asylum centre and handed over to the cantonal authorities. The flight is part of Switzerland’s support for the Greek authorities, the SEM said. The Swiss government has also pledged CHF1.1 million ($1.2 billion) in emergency aid for projects benefiting children and teenagers in refugee camps on Greek Aegean island, the SEM added. The Swiss branch of the United Nations refugee agencyExternal link, UNHCR as well as the Swiss refugee council, have welcomed the government’s initiative and called for an extension of the programme. There are an estimated 5,000 unaccompanied minors currently living in refugee camps in Greece, according to the UNHCR. European Union countries have pledged to take in about 1,600 unaccompanied minors. In April, more than 100 organisations, including church groups, launched an appeal to take in refugees, saying Switzerland shared “a responsibility for the humanitarian catastrophe on the Greek islands.” A petition signed by more than 30,000 people called on the government and parliament to act to help improve the dire situation in the refugee camps on the Greek islands.

2020-05-16;National Bank snubs calls for more coronavirus money;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/policy-principle_national-bank-snubs-calls-for-more-coronavirus-money/45764844;The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has dismissed demands to increase its payout to help the economy cope with the costs of the coronavirus pandemic. Governing board member Andréa Maechler an additional financial contribution would counteract monetary policy. “We are already making our contribution to the efforts to cope with the crisis not only by intervening on the currency markets,” she told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper in a wide-ranging interview. She said Switzerland was experiencing a shock that is stronger than previously imagined but the role of the SNB was unchanged – to ensure the monetary conditions through interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Maechler said the CHF4 billion ($4.1 billion) payout to the Swiss government and the 26 cantons this year was the maximum the central bank could envisage. The bank made a surplus of about CHF49 billion in 2019. A swift recovery of the Swiss economy is unlikely, according to her. “Social distancing rules, higher debts and higher unemployment rates as well as lower salaries will mean that more time is needed for the economy to recover,” she said. MaechlerExternal link, one of three members of the central bank’s directorate, said the SNB did not fear an inflation or a deflationary spiral in Switzerland despite pressure from the strong Swiss franc and a shock in oil prices.

The possibility to move freely is a psychological necessity.”  Cassis said he confident that Swiss voters would reject a right-wing proposal to suspend a deal with the EU on the free movement of people. It will come to a nationwide vote in September.  The Swiss government closed its borders in mid-March to stem the spreading of the Covid-19 pandemic and imposed a lockdown on public life as well as part of its economy.  However, it stopped short of a general curfew like in Italy or France.

2020-05-16;How Geneva Airport helped the international city take off;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/centenary-celebration_how-geneva-airport-helped-the-international-city-take-off/45733762;At 10:20am on September 23, 1920, Swiss pilot Edgar Primault safely landed his Haefeli DH-3 plane on a bumpy field north of Geneva, marking the official inauguration of Geneva-Cointrin airport. A century later, it’s become Switzerland’s second-busiest aviation hub – although it, like most of the world’s airports, is currently at a standstill amid the coronavirus pandemic and faces an uncertain future. A new bookExternal link revisits the key phases of the airport’s development. Over the past century, the simple grass airstrip, with an administrative building, café and dormitory for pilots, has expanded into a sprawling international airport.  Western Switzerland was an aeronautical early adopter. Back in the early 1900s, flying machines and daredevil pilots, especially in neighbouring France, caught the public’s imagination. In Geneva, businessmen, politicians and bankers organised air meetings and helped set up flying clubs. At the end of the First World War, the availability of bigger, more reliable planes and trained pilots meant that civil aviation – the transporting of mail, goods and passengers by air – was ready to take off. Seaplanes took advantage of Swiss lakes for take-off and landing, but it became clear that Geneva needed a proper aerodrome. The Geneva government’s argument for an airport was massively strengthened when, in summer 1919, global powers decided the city should become the future seat of the League of Nations.  The local authorities swiftly approved a plan and funds to build an airport, and land at Cointrin was identified as the ideal location. During its early years, civilian and military planes from other Swiss regions and abroad used the aerodrome. But the number of passengers was limited. Commercial flights only really took off from 1924 to places like Lausanne, Zurich, Paris, Lyon, Munich and Nuremberg. But League of Nations officials appeared initially hesitant to use the airport. The Geneva government wrote to the League in 1922 to present its facilities and routes, and to enquire about its members’ future flight requirements. Yet according to UN archives, the reply was that pricey tickets and the limited number of flights – only operating in summer during the day - prevented the League from using this mode of transport more often. Instead, League members seemed to prefer the train. In the 1930s the number of airlines multiplied. Swissair, for example, was born in 1931. Larger planes were introduced, which meant Geneva Airport had to be extended and lit to improve safety. As so-called International Geneva grew in stature and personnel – the secretariat of the League of Nations eventually moved into the newly-built Palais des Nations in 1936 – the airport became more important too. “From the middle of the 1920s until the beginning of the 1930s, the League of Nations, which saw the interest of aviation, imagined placing the airport under its control with a view to turning it into an instrument that would secure international relations in the event of conflict,” UN archivist Pierre-Étienne Bourneuf told the Tribune de Genève. The project was never carried out for financial reasons. From 1945-1950, other international organisations moved to the city giving a boost to the airport, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the forerunner of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The outbreak of the Second World War put a brutal stop to commercial air traffic. Airports closed, including Geneva, but infrastructure work continued. At the end of the war, much of Europe lay in ruins, but Geneva with its long runway emerged as one of the best-equipped facilities.  Geneva’s location in the centre of Europe was ideal for long-haul commercial flights that started in the post-war era.  Geneva was Switzerland’s busiest international airport for a number of years, with the city hosting important guests and conferences. The federal authorities were nonetheless keen to build in an intercontinental airport in the German-speaking region. In 1946, work started on a new airport at Kloten, near Zurich, followed by the first flights in 1948.  Despite being heavily dependent on the national carrier Swissair (60% of traffic in 1952), Geneva started to feel overlooked in favour of ZurichExternal link, where Swissair had up to 1,500 employees, compared to just 250 at Geneva.  In years that followed, Geneva remained a major hub for Swissair long-haul flights. But in 1996 most of these were switched to Kloten, despite fierce protests from political and business leaders in western Switzerland.  It was not until the Swissair grounding in 2001 that Geneva Airport switched direction to refocus its strategy on the low-cost airline Easyjet, which now accounts for 45% of traffic, versus 15% for Swissair’s replacement Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS). Geneva Airport also worked to rebuild its network of long-haul connections with other airlines.  Over the past decade, Geneva’s modified strategy has borne fruit. Air traffic has doubled, terminals have been extended and facilities have been modernised. Geneva has strengthened its position as Switzerland’s second busiest airport with 57 airlines serving 149 destinations.  Traffic was expected to continue to rise, however, coronavirus External linkhas thrown a spanner in the works. Newer, bigger commercial jet planes in the 1950s-1960s meant that the runway had to be further extended in 1960, resulting in a territorial exchange and agreement with neighbouring France. The airport lies entirely within Swiss territory, but its northern limit runs along the Swiss-French border and the airport can be accessed from both countries. External link At Zurich, Switzerland and neighbouring Germany were involved in a decades-long controversy to reach an agreement over noise emissions and flight slots. The airport is just 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) south of the German border.  Sébastien Leprat, head of external relations at Geneva Airport, said the situation with France was very different.  “There are numerous different flight paths leaving the airport which impact both Switzerland and France,” he said. Cooperation with France is good and issues are dealt with on a regular basis between air traffic control agencies and inter-state coordination groups, Leprat added.    Future expansion plans at the airport remain up in the air, however. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, officials predicted air traffic to increase from 18 million passengers in 2019 to 25 million passengers by 2030. But airport director André SchneiderExternal link only expects the airport to recover its 2019 passenger figures (18 million) in 2024.  Local environmental concerns are also likely to have a big influence in the years to come. These were on evidence last November when Geneva voters backed a local initiative calling for democratic piloting of the airport, including tighter controls on any expansion, with noise and air pollution becoming a higher priority.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-16;Catching the last flight home during the Covid-19 pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_catching-the-last-flight-home-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/45763012;An Indian national recounts her stressful return to her family in Switzerland aboard one of the last repatriation flights. It was 8.05 am on April 26, an hour after the LX-8919 flight from the Indian city of Kochi landed at Zurich Airport and I was still on the plane. A few minutes later, when our row number was called out by the airport personnel, I disembarked quietly from the aircraft - the only plane that had landed at this hour. The airport was eerily quiet and it was less crowded than normal. People walked slowly in small groups. My eyes spotted a known face from a distance waiting for me anxiously by the doors of the departure gate.   It somehow felt strange not to get the usual warm “welcome back” hugs or kisses from my husband. Only tears of joy.  He drove me home to Geneva. When we reached I stood at the door for a few minutes gazing at my children, my beloved precious little ones. Their eyes twinkled with exhilaration on seeing me. I could feel a sense of accomplishment in their eyes. This “special” moment that we were all waiting for had finally come.   It was a moment that we truly deserved after I had dodged the coronavirus that had spread like a forest fire to almost all the places that I had travelled on a holiday to India. I had successfully completed an evacuation operation.  Ten days earlier, I was in my parents’ home in the southern Indian city of Chennai and under lockdown. I started the day with my usual prayers. I had stayed awake for most of the night anxious about the outcome of my Covid-19 test results. The country was in lockdown and the previous morning, a man fully covered in white PPE entered the house to carry out the test.   I was ready for it. “Come what may, I am going to take this test,” I told myself. This test would after all determine whether I could fly out next week to re-join my family in Geneva or not. I also wanted to be sure that I wasn’t infected anyway. I was probably asymptomatic and living with the virus all this while. These were the thoughts running through my head.   The man dressed in white stood by the entrance of the apartment. He took the throat swab and it was all done. The entire process took less than five minutes. I was happy that it was over and waited for the medical report results.   It was the Tamil New Year’s Day and Vishu - an auspicious day for the people of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, that marks the beginning of the new year. The Covid-19 test results finally arrived in an email. I quickly scrolled down to read through the results. Immediately, I emailed the results to my doctor. The doctor confirmed that the test was negative. My children got excited knowing that I finally had a chance to fly back to Geneva and be with them.  I then got in touch with the Swiss embassy representative who was assisting me with the repatriation efforts. I was offered an option to fly via the UK but there was not enough time to reach the airport and I dropped the idea. I was then given the option to board the last repatriation flight from India to Switzerland. It would leave on April 25 from Kochi, almost 700km away. I had to get there by road at any cost.   On my road trip to Kochi I was stopped at the Walayar inter-state border post where I was scanned to ascertain my body temperature. I was not surprised when they asked me to step aside after having detected a high body temperature. I knew in the back of my mind that it was because I was sipping hot water while sitting by the window of the vehicle when it was blazing hot outside.   I pointed out to the police officer that despite looking healthy, almost half of the passengers scanned showed high temperatures. He smiled and asked us to wait for a bit before the second round of scanning.  I was right. After standing in the shade for a few minutes, everyone was found to have a normal temperature in the second round of scanning.  Nevertheless, it was a stressful few minutes for everybody.   I heaved a sigh of relief when we were let inside Kochi Airport after yet more temperature scanning. Other passengers in the airport refused to message their friends or family until they were seated in their plane seats. There was so much uncertainty until the last minute and I wasn’t alone.   My parents and I got emotional when I finally took my seat on the flight. I secretly hoped that they would sleep well that night.  I realised then that my journey was actually happening. When I look back, what really got me this far was nothing but hope. When I reached home in Geneva, it didn’t matter that I didn’t get a hug or a kiss. What mattered most was that I got home in the end.   The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-05-15;The World Trade Organization and the demise of multilateralism;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_the-world-trade-organization-and-the-demise-of-multilateralism/45763264;"Seventy-five years after the creation of the United Nations in the wake of the Second World War, the resignation of the director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Roberto Azevedo, does not bode well for the international trading system, multilateralism and International Geneva. The WTO has had several major setbacks even before the pandemic: The Doha Development Round to lower trade barriers which started in November 2001 has not been completed; the WTO’s unique dispute-settlement system was stymied last year when the United States blocked all nominees.  The disheartened Brazilian diplomat threw in the towel, saying, ”If I stay here will the virus go away? The virus will not go away. If I stay here will the US and China all of a sudden shake hands and say, ‘Let bygones be bygones’? No, that is not going to happen. Nothing is going to change if I stay here.” The director-general was not without his critics. “He was not courageous enough to take positions on major issues in favour of the principles of the organisation and he was afraid to confront the United States,” said a former member of the WTO’s Appellate Body, who commented that Azevedo lacked the political dexterity of his predecessor, Pascal Lamy. “In a sense, the WTO never recovered from the violent protests against the organisation during the 1999 Seattle Ministerial meeting,” added the former member.  More recently, the US-China trade war has hindered any progress towards global trade agreements. While working on a bilateral arrangement, the US and China have bypassed the Geneva-based organisation, significantly hindering any new global agreements or completion of the Doha Round. Azevedo admitted that “we are doing nothing now - no negotiations, everything is stuck. There’s nothing happening in terms of regular work.” In a larger sense, the failure of the WTO reflects the demise of multilateralism through the lack of American leadership. President Woodrow Wilson was the driving force behind the League of Nations. The US and its allies were instrumental in the creation of the United Nations, specifically in the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the WTO.  As well as being a multilateral leader, the US has also historically been suspicious of multilateralism, as evidenced by the failure of the US Congress to agree to join the League of Nations. Today, the list of the current Trump Administration’s attacks on the system is long. Among them are failure to sign the Paris climate accord; withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement; withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC); withdrawal from the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO); suspending payments to the World Health Organization (WHO) and ending funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  The consequences for International Geneva and Switzerland are dramatic. The WTO, UNHCHR and WHO are all based in Geneva. Aside from a vacuum left by the lack of US. political leadership, the financial consequences could be dire. The US has been the multilateral system’s major contributor. Countries under economic pressure due to the Covid-19 pandemic will have trouble supporting the UN system. The contribution of international organisations to Geneva’s economy has been well documented.  The coronavirus has shown the weaknesses of multilateralism. It is ironic that solutions to a global pandemic have turned countries inward. Scientists are cooperating to find a vaccine, but competition over scarce resources has shown that in times of crisis, countries look for domestic solutions to a global problem. So beyond the chaos at the WTO, the UN system continues to be weakened. “The balance of power has changed since the end of the Second World War,” notes Georges Abi-Saab, Emeritus Professor of International Law at the Graduate Institute. “Formal structures and international organisations are too divorced from the new balance of power.” In addition, he said, “multilateral organisations lack charismatic leaders which has led the UN to be marginalised on major issues like peace and security.

2020-05-15;Swiss companies vetted for pandemic loan abuses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fraud-detection_swiss-companies-vetted-for-pandemic-loan-abuses/45763252;The Swiss authorities say they are confident that fraudulent applications for emergency company loans can be weeded out during the coronavirus pandemic. More than 120,000 firms have asked for state-guaranteed loans, of which CHF14.6 billion had been issued since March. The rescue package for companies forced to shut down during the pandemic was doubled to CHF40 billion last month. The loans make up the lion’s share of CHF57 billion in financial relief that has been rubber stamped by parliament. But the unprecedented step to provide so much money at short notice has led to fears that unscrupulous firms and individuals could exploit the generosity by ripping-off the fund. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) said on Friday that it was remaining vigilant about potential abuses and had uncovered 36 suspect cases. Seco screening for applicants already in liquidation, those mis-stating their revenues, applying for multiple loans through different banks or firms that would misuse funds – for example, to pay dividends. Seco’s Erik Jakob told a press conference that a series of measures set up to combat fraud should keep the number of abuses to a minimum. He said that a recent review of anti-fraud defences had shown the system to be robust. These measures include cross-referencing loan application informationExternal link against data from the commercial registry and tax records. The 123 banks issuing loans also screen companies using standard anti-money laundering checks. A special government department, set up specifically to review bridging loan applications, has been tasked with scrutinising documentation and checking that companies had not already entered into bankruptcy proceedings. The unit is authorised to issue civil or criminal complaints against miscreants. The Federal Audit Office adds another layer of scrutiny, matching company revenue information against tax records and ensuring that the funds are not simply given to shareholders as dividends. Abnormalities are then flagged up to Seco. The finance ministry earlier said it also looking into ways to beef up criminal sanctions to prosecute not just fraudulent firms but also company directors.

Some had threatened to keep their children away from school.  + Uncertainty reigns as schools re-open amid coronavirus pandemic + Our fact check on children as drivers of the pandemic  Speaking after the first week of school on Friday, the Swiss Teachers’ Federation (LCH), its French-speaking counterpart SER and the Association of Head Teachers all said that members had reported very few absences overall.   Parents who keep their children at home should not be punished, said Dagmar Rösler, the LCH president, referring to some cantons fining for absences. Their fears and concerns should be taken seriously, she added.  A lot was being done by schools to win parents’ trust, added Rösler. This included daily cleaning of surfaces, door handles and school areas. In many schools, no adults apart from staff and cleaners, were allowed on the premises.  Schools are subject to national safety requirements drawn up by the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link, designed to protect pupils and teachers. This also includes an emphasis on handwashing, but no wearing of face masks.  SER president Samuel Rohrbach added that around 2-3% of teachers would continue to work at home as they were part of the official risk groups.  + Schools re-opening hit by lack of teachers Not all pupils went back under the same conditions, as the cantons (who are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland) have taken different approaches.    While the majority of German-speaking cantons opted for a full re-opening, the French-speaking SwitzerlandExternal link, as well as the German-speaking cantons of Zurich and St Gallen have taken a step-by-step approach.

2020-05-15;Are apprenticeships undergoing a ‘corona shock’?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education-_are-apprenticeships-undergoing-a--corona-shock--/45760184;"The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting current and future apprenticeships in Switzerland. With around two-thirds of young people taking the vocational route, the consequences could be worrying, experts say.  The country’s much admired dual-track apprenticeship systemExternal link sees young people combine on-the-job training with lessons in a vocational school, producing a well-qualified workforce. It is considered one of Switzerland’s economic success factors. But the economy has been impacted severely by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.  + Economic cost of pandemic will be enormous: SNB chief  + Switzerland facing biggest economic slump since 1975  Concerned, the government announced the creation of a task force on apprenticeships earlier this month. “We expect companies to go out of business and as a result, apprenticeship places to be lost. Plus it might become harder for those who have finished their apprenticeships to find a job,” a statementExternal link to mark the founding of the taskforce said.  It wants to ensure that as many young people as possible find training by the beginning of August 2020.   On Friday the government addedExternal link that, following the latest meeting of the taskforce, it had freed up extra funding for apprenticeship support projects.  It has been harder for 14-15 year-old pupils to look for apprenticeships during the lockdown, especially as schools, which support pupils in their search, were closed for eight weeks. Some companies were offering online taster days and video-chat interviews during this time, but not all were able to do this.  The government said on Friday that it expected the effects of the lockdown on apprenticeships - and the subsequent re-opening of schools and economic sector - to become clearer during May.  It also warned that repercussions could be seen over the next few years as well. Leading education economist Stefan Wolter has already said he expects a large rise in youth unemployment this summer due to the coronavirus impact, as he told several newspapers on May 9.   The effects could also be longer-term, according to a study published the day beforeExternal link, co-authored with Samuel Lüthi, his colleague at the Swiss Coordination Centre for Research in Education. Depending on how deep the recession is, Switzerland could be short of 14,000- 23,000 apprenticeship places until 2025, the study warned.  Who is the hardest hit? School leavers still looking for training places (half are already taken); “youths with academic shortcomings” as they generally spend longer looking for apprenticeships; and those looking to crisis-hit sectors such as catering and tourism.   But there may also be pressure for firms to keep on their older, graduating apprentices (a majority usually move on, clearing the way for new learners), which may not be possible due to apprenticeship contacts with school leavers having already been signed.  The Apprenticeship Pulse research projectExternal link - a cooperation between the Yousty.chExternal link, the largest apprenticeship jobs platform, and the Chair of Education Systems at Switzerland’s Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)External link - has also just published its results on the coronavirus impact. These were mixed.  The bad news is that 2.8% of new apprenticeships positions for this autumn have already been cut due to Covid-19, according to the training companies surveyed in the project. A further 5.5% are slated to be cut this autumn.  The good news: “Currently there are still more than 14,900 apprenticeship places open for 2020 – this is almost as many as at the beginning of the lockdown. This means that pupils can still find an apprenticeship which is a good sign. In addition, some firms told the study that they would be prepared to offer additional apprenticeships to give young people a chance,” the authors told swissinfo.ch via email.  The project also points to uncertainty for graduating apprentices: about 25% of apprentices were working in companies less likely than before to employ them full-time upon competition of training.   The situation is also mixed around the cantons: canton Geneva is down by 1,000 apprenticeships on last yearExternal link, but canton Basel CityExternal link has reported 44 more contracts signed than last year and no apprenticeship terminations due to the crisis.   The differences partly arise from the fact that apprenticeship contracts are generally signed earlier in the German-speaking part of the country than in the Italian or French-speaking parts.   In the meanwhile, experts advise those with uncertain futures to keep on looking.  “It’s better to start an apprenticeship a bit later and perhaps under more difficult circumstances in autumn than taking on a bridging option. In many cases, a bridge year [between school and an apprenticeship] does not help your chances that much on the job market,” Urs Casty of Yousty.ch told the NZZ newspaperExternal link.  In addition, some school leavers may have to give up on their “dream” apprenticeshipExternal link - the most popular one is in office work - and look for alternatives, experts add.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-15;Police expect more anti-lockdown demonstrations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/weekend-protests_police-expect-more-anti-lockdown-demonstrations/45762588;Swiss police say they are prepared for more demonstrations at the weekend that breach current rules on social distancing during the coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of protestors gathered in cities such as Bern and Zurich over the last two weekends. A spokesperson for Bern police told Swiss public broadcaster SRFExternal link that more demonstrations are expected in coming days. As a result, more police officers will be present on the streets of the Swiss capital. Two weeks’ ago, police broke up demonstrations because they defied lockdown restrictions on more than five people gathering in public places. That rule is expected to stay in place until at least early June. The police action was heavily criticised by Amnesty International that called on the authorities to respect the right to peaceful protest. Last weekend, police took no direct action, citing the presence of children and elderly people among protestors as a reason not to use force. Instead, officers issued verbal warnings and followed this up by writing up reports on dozens of people that could result in prosecutions at a later date. Protestors have been mainly demonstrating against the social and economic restrictions imposed by the government under the powers of the Epidemics Act. But some have also attended with messages relating to the environment, 5G antennae and other subjects. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-15;Cross-border worker tax unaffected by Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-deal_cross-border-worker-tax-unaffected-by-covid-19/45762416;Switzerland has agreed with France that cross-border workers should be taxed as normal despite being unable to physically go to work. Similar deals with other neighbouring countries are expected to be inked soon. Some 330,000 people work in Switzerland while living in neighbouring countries – a number that has increased by just under 40,000 in the last five years. Some 55% of these cross-border workers live in France. In common with other countries, Switzerland has restricted access across its borders during the coronavirus pandemic. It will take at least a month for borders to return to normal, the government said this week. The State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF) said that it recognizes that border restrictions, plus other lockdown measures, have made it impossible for some cross-border workers to  enter Switzerland in recent weeks. On paper, this could compromise long-standing arrangements about which country taxes such individuals and that protect people from being taxed twice – in both their country of residence and work. On Thursday, Switzerland announced that it had entered into a preliminary agreement with France to allow existing tax agreements to stand despite workers being unable to cross borders. So cross-border commuters who have been forced to work from home will be taxed as if they are able to physically go to their normal place of work. The mutual understanding has been backdated to March 14 and will last until the end of this month – after which it could be extended. SIF says the French deal, which covers 180,000 workers, is expected to be replicated with other neighbouring countries. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-15;Emma Hodcroft: The ‘virus hunter’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/nextstrain_emma-hodcraft--the--virus-hunter-/45762072;"Tracking mutations of the coronavirus as it spreads across the world, biologist Emma Hodcroft has become one of Switzerland’s most-followed researchers on Twitter.  Her name has appeared in Wired, the Boston Globe and (German-language media including) the NZZ, but also in the Aargauer Zeitung, Blick and even Nau, a news platform shown on screens in buses, at petrol stations and fitness centres. This is an impressive feat, because Emma Hodcroft, an American-British researcher working in Basel, does pretty complicated research. She is busy mapping mutations of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in real time. But her straightforward communication style has made her one of the best-known faces of science in Switzerland during the pandemic, along with senior experts. “It was heart-warming to be featured in local media. As a foreigner in Switzerland, I felt accepted and valued”, she says, sitting on a metal chair in a park next to her flat in Basel. But she regrets that the media sometimes badly misrepresent the genetics of coronavirus: “A mistaken narrative keeps popping up: that some types of SARS-CoV-2 would have different epidemiological properties, such as being more or less contagious according to the population at hand. But this is absolutely incorrect. We’ve compared tens of thousands of virus samples from all over the world, looking at mutations where one genetic letter is exchanged for another. And even the two most divergent mutations have no more than 40 such mismatches out of the 29,000 base pairs that contain their whole genetic information. These are very small differences, and have so far shown no impact on the behaviour of the virus”. She does not shy away from publicly correcting such misrepresentations, and she uses the opportunity to broaden the debate. When USA Today mentioned “eight strains of the coronavirus” in a headline, she tweeted: “Thanks to your article we are inundated with emails about people very worried about these strains. Every time you decide to go with an alarmist unfounded incorrect headline, you burden already overworked scientists trying to battle #COVID19 with more work trying to calm the panic. We are working so hard – plz don’t make our jobs harder!! Report responsibly”. Her research showed in early March 2020 that the epidemic in Seattle was fuelled by community-based infections, not by people importing the disease from abroad. Such analyses can be useful in assessing the effect of travel bans and closing borders. “What we see from the genetics is that there were many imports and exports of the virus, into and out of most countries, especially Europe. This shows that by the time the borders were closed, the virus had already spread. It also goes against the idea that just one country infected the others”. She says she’s aware her research will be politicised, but feels it’s her duty to explain it the best she can. “We always stress the limits of what we know, even if we are aware that this uncertainty might get lost once in the media. We sometimes decide to share preliminary results only with scientists, because the uncertainty is just too great for us to risk it being misrepresented. Our work is very visual, with colourful relational trees and a world map covered with zigzagging lines. This can tempt the media into telling stories that just are not supported by the data”. Emma Hodcroft’s life path is itself reminiscent of just such a map. Born in Norway to parents working in the oil industry, she grew up in Aberdeen in Scotland before following her American mother to Fort Worth in Texas when she was five years old. She spent every summer with her father in Scotland – travelling the first time alone with her younger sister when she was 12. They attended an extra month of school in the UK, because the holidays there were not synched with the US. “We never thought the additional school was odd; we didn’t know any different. And no, I don’t think it made us any smarter!”, she laughs. Despite her rising stardom in the world of research, she insists she was an average student: “My dream had always been to be a medical doctor, but my grades at university in Texas were not good enough to pursue it. I realised then that research could actually be a career, and that people got paid to study evolution, a topic I had been interested in since I was a teenager. This helped me to spend less time reading and playing video games, and more time studying. I also liked computing, which I had learned from my mother and a teacher at high school”. After completing her studies in Edinburgh, UK, she started researching the genetic evolution of that other famous virus, HIV. She moved to Basel in 2017 to work with Richard Neher, a cofounder of Nextstrain: an open-source projectExternal link to analyse and visualise phylogenetic trees of pathogens such as coronavirus, influenza, Zika and Ebola. “As a scientist, I know a lot about what’s happening in the Covid pandemic, and probably do not have the same worries as most people who feel more uncertainty in the situation. I think I’m a bit shielded from the impact of the current lockdown [April 2020, eds.], because I essentially spend almost all my time working. I work from home on my laptop, sometimes at my partner’s. I start by checking up my emails when I get up at seven in the morning, to see what the Nextstrain team in New Zealand has posted; I catch up with the Seattle team in the late afternoon. I fetch new genomic data posted on international servers, run analyses, check for errors, correct sample metadata such as location or time. We then look for patterns, annotate the graphs, upload to the website and post on Twitter, tagging the lab which has sequenced the virus sample. I finish work at 9-10 pm. I take a few breaks to eat. I do try to take the morning or the afternoon off on Sundays. Altogether, I might be on a sort of high: while the epidemic is really sad, I’m fortunate to be in a position where my work and skills count and do make a difference. This is incredibly rewarding, and motivating”. Her team is continuously improving the code, in particular to deal with the very high traffic it has attracted as the pandemic spreads. Her research is a perfect example of open science: on the one hand, the data comes from a multitude of institutions across the world that upload genomes sequenced from local viruses on a common platform. On the other hand, all of Nextstrain’s data and analyses are posted online. She welcomes the exchanges that this openness allows: “We get better science if we work together and if we are open to criticism. This remains the best way to improve”. Hodcroft had 800 followers on Twitter in January 2020. Four months later, she has almost 18,000. “I try hard to do as much as I can because I feel I’m good at science communication. I instinctively started reacting when I saw misinformation. At the beginning, a lot of people were hearing mixed messages, from ‘it’s no worse than the flu’ to ‘well, the situation in China looks worrying’. I wrote a thread differentiating preparedness from panic, because I felt the message was not clearly communicated by governments. My tweets generated more and more reactions, and I realised I needed a system to deal with it: I won’t respond to comments that are mean, rude or loony. But I do give people the benefit of the doubt because I think they might be scared by the disease. I still have to remind myself that I don’t owe anyone an answer on Twitter if I don’t want to. As a young woman rising on social media, I consider myself lucky: I did not experience proper harassment – usually, rude comments or weird pictures are sent only once”. She says that Twitter has been used a lot, not just to talk to lay people, but also for constructive scientific discussion between researchers about the latest data and analyses: “Usually, researchers communicate by publishing letters in scientific journals. We just don’t have the time for that!” In a noted tweet, Hodcroft highlights a conundrum: special funding schemes for Covid research are great, but might select the wrong kind of researchers: “Those working on #SARSCoV2 *right now* are those least able to write grants!” Currently working some 80 hours a week, she says she would struggle to find the time to fill in grant proposal forms. Many underfunded scientists are in the same situation, she says, but keep adding hours for urgent research on Covid-19. She suggests a completely different way of funding research: “Instead of selecting projects on the basis of what they promise, funders could allocate money a posteriori, according to the output of research which has been already done during the pandemic”. But does she actually need money for her work? “Not really for myself, because of great support from the University of Basel. But many labs around the world, in Greece or Portugal in particular, cannot buy the reagents necessary to sequence virus samples, which is the genomic data needed by Nextstrain. So I’d like funding to be able to pay them for that”. During our two-hour conversation, Hodcroft paints an intricate picture of how scientists work, think and feel in times of crisis. She provides clear answers, original perspectives, strong opinions and names relevant sources, but keeps stressing the limits of what she knows. At 33, she finds herself in a crucial moment in her career. Her publication record now starts to count a lot, and she wonders whether her CV will really benefit from all the time invested in communicating and sharing data. While her work is obviously having an immense societal impact, the latter is not captured by the usual metrics for measuring scientific careers. As of April 2020, her publications had been cited a relatively modest 410 times. “But the greater goal is not me”, she says. “It’s to help the world by understanding it”.

2020-05-15;Who’s at risk of poverty in Switzerland?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_undocumented-migrants-and-freelancers-risk-poverty-in-switzerland/45759960;Almost 8% of the population was already living in poverty in Switzerland before the coronavirus crisis, and more than a million people were struggling to stay above the minimum subsistence level. The pandemic threatens to push many of them into precarious situations. The images have caused such a stir that they have been published by major international media, including The GuardianExternal link, the New York TimesExternal link and Radio France InternationaleExternal link (RFI): over 1,500 people queued up last Saturday, stretching for over one kilometre, as they had done the previous week, to receive free food parcels worth CHF20 ($30) in one of the richest and most expensive cities in the world, Geneva. Despite its wealth, canton Geneva has major socio-economic disparities. Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, the number of people requesting food support has quadrupled. The Covid-19 epidemic highlights the fragility of the poorest in Swiss society, who lost part or even all income sources overnight. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) conducted a surveyExternal link of the beneficiaries of this food distribution on May 2. Published on Monday, the results show that more than half of the participants have no legal status. However, the survey underlines that more than one-third of those present are eligible for social assistance (Swiss citizens, residents with a residence permit or asylum seekers). Many of these people of diverse national origins work in domestic services such as childcare or housework, HUG doctor François Chappuis told Swiss public television RTSExternal link. These tenuous commitments have often been cancelled as a result of the semi-confinement measures in mid-March. Many of those affected are single mothers. Some of the participants are Swiss citizens. The survey provides further evidence of the extreme fragility of the beneficiaries. In particular, we learn that six out of 10 respondents have no health coverage, and this share rises to almost nine out of 10 among undocumented migrants. More than 10% of the respondents have given up medical care in the last two months. Vulnerable people pushed over the edge Before the coronavirus crisis broke out, poverty and insecurity were already a reality for hundreds of thousands of people in Switzerland. According to figures published this year by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO), around 660,000 people (almost 8% of the population) endured poverty in 2018. More than a million people, or around one in seven, were at risk of falling below the poverty line. There are more than 130,000 working poor in the country. Every fifth person lacks sufficient financial resources to meet an unexpected expense of CHF2,500. Already vulnerable profiles, such as single-parent households, the chronically unemployed or undocumented migrants, now represent the majority of people who have turned to Caritas Switzerland since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. For the past two months, the association helping those on the margins of society has seen a sharp increase in the number of consultations. They have doubled or even tripled in some branches. However, the semi-confinement measures have also weakened other categories of the population that are more socially and economically integrated. Wage cuts linked to short-time work, which has affected nearly two million employees, can lead to a drop in wages if the pay was already low , notes Caritas spokesperson Fabrice Boulé.  Another vulnerable profile is that of small independent entrepreneurs suddenly deprived of any income, who no longer have the financial reserves to survive. About 4,000 of them have had to appeal for transitional aid from Caritas, according to the organisation. The government has promised emergency help, but the long waiting period for this state support has forced them into debt.  One-third of Switzerland's 600,000 self-employed people believe their very survival is at stake due to the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey conductedExternal link in April by the Centre for Economic Research at federal technology institute ETH Zurich and the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Lausanne.

2020-05-14;‘Clean and safe’ image could boost Swiss tourism;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_-clean-and-safe--image-could-boost-swiss-tourism/45760556;Switzerland Tourism has welcomed next month’s re-opening of borders with France, Germany and Austria. It believes the country’s reputation for cleanliness and tidiness could be a selling point once the Covid-19 pandemic dies down.  “What doesn’t seem very sexy in normal times can be a big plus in times of crisis,” said Urs Eberhard, deputy director of Switzerland TourismExternal link, in an interview with news agency Keystone-ATS on Thursday.  + Expats in Switzerland like the safety but not the localsExternal link Asked whether guests should wear protective face masks in Swiss hotels, Eberhard said Switzerland has a “very strong” concept of protection against coronavirus – for hotels, restaurants and tourist transport – which the organisation plans to publish on its website to inform guests and “create trust”.  Eberhard said it was important that Switzerland and its neighbours now coordinate their protection measures. He also welcomed the recommendation made on Wednesday by the European Commission to the Schengen statesExternal link to re-open their internal borders. He saw this as a “signal” for tourism.  Nevertheless, he acknowledged that it might take time for foreign travellers to return.  “Initially, we’re relying above all on domestic customers. One can’t underestimate the fact that in times of crisis people need to hide themselves away,” Eberhard said. “Many will therefore spend their holidays in their own country.”  But “sooner or later” people will feel the need to travel, and foreign tourists should therefore return “in the medium term”.  As for non-European visitors, it was difficult to say when they will return, according to Eberhard. “First of all, the external borders of the Schengen area will have to be re-opened.”  But he said one thing was certain: Switzerland would “not make any offers at cut-rate prices”.  “Rather, we could use this new beginning to convince people to stay with us longer. This would also increase added value,” he said.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-14;The lockdown leaves students strapped for cash;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/financial-support_the-lockdown-puts-students-out-of-income/45757368;Due to the coronavirus pandemic 60% of student jobs have disappeared. As these were the only source of income for many young people, requests for financial support sent to universities have drastically increased since the beginning of the lockdown. Maxance is studying and normally gets by on CHF1350 ($1390)/month, but without a job, her outlook is bleak. “All of a sudden, everything closes and I’m getting cancellation emails about concerts and entertainment jobs. My employer tells me ‘I don’t know what I’ll do, I’m also living with uncertainty, unfortunately there’s no work at the moment’,” she said. She can get CHF450/month in unemployment money and her university has stepped in to offer a grant for these unprecedented circumstances: CHF500/month for three months. The amount and type of financial support varies from university to university, but all major institutions have cleared funds to support their students.

2020-05-14;Roche in talks with Britain on Covid-19 antibody test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/roche-britain-covid-19-antibody-test-coronavirus/45760088;"Britain is in talks with Swiss drugmaker Roche on rolling out an accurate Covid-19 antibody test that it said could be a game changer on getting the world's fifth largest economy back to work. The novel coronavirus, which emerged in China, has propelled the world towards the sharpest recession in centuries with many people isolating at home as governments grapple with one of the biggest health crises since the 1918 influenza  epidemic. The British government said it was talking with Roche on rolling out its test after a Public Health England laboratory at Porton Down, in Wiltshire, concluded it had 100% specificity. That means it can detect antibodies to the exact disease rather than similar ones. This has the potential to be a game changer, said Edward Argar, Britain's junior health minister. We are now moving as fast as we can to discuss with Roche purchasing of those but I can't give you an exact date when we'll be able to start rolling them out. The Roche test received a conformity assessment, known as Conformité Européenne, or CE mark, from the European  Union on April 28 and received emergency approval from the  US Food and Drug Administration on May 2. Before the Porton Down laboratory's results, the United Kingdom had said no COVID-19 antibody test was accurate enough to use. This is a very positive development because such a highly specific anti-body test is a very reliable marker of past infection, said John Newton, national coordinator of the UK Coronavirus Testing Programme. Scientific experts at PHE Porton Down carried out an independent evaluation of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2  serology assay in record time, concluding that it is a highly specific assay with specificity of 100%. Roche said late on Wednesday it was in talks with the National Health Service and the UK government about a phased roll-out of antibody test kits as soon as possible and would be able to provide hundreds of thousands of the test kits per week. The test requires a blood sample to be taken by a qualified healthcare professional and processed in a laboratory, Roche said, adding that it was one of the most accurate tests on the market with over 99.8 specificity. This level of accuracy is vitally important because there are a number of viruses with very similar antibodies to Covid-19, including the common cold, and other SARS strains, which can produce a positive result in some less accurate antibody tests. The Telegraph, which first reported the findings, said the government was in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of kits. Similar antibody tests have also been developed by companies including US-based Abbott Laboratories and Italy’s DiaSorin. Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected, although it is not yet clear whether that confers permanent immunity.

2020-05-14;Switzerland mulls controversial Covid-19 health passports;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/technology_switzerland-mulls-controversial-covid-19-health-passports/45757950;"Swiss technology firms and medical researchers are developing digital health passports that could be used to certify who is immune to Covid-19. But scientists don’t yet know whether having the virus confers immunity, and treating people differently based on their immunity status raises serious ethical questions for Switzerland and other countries mulling this option.    Assuming there is such a thing as immunity from Covid-19, the pros of an immunity passport are easy to imagine. The document could be presented to access elder care homes, travel safely internationally, and attend large sporting or cultural events without putting oneself or others at risk. It could be used within medical teams so those lacking immunity don’t come into unnecessary contact with Covid-19 patients. And it could come in handy in strategic sectors to, for example, prevent all the workers at a nuclear power plant from getting sick at once.  The creation of immunity passports is well underway in Switzerland, a country known for valuing privacy and developing quality security products. It is also home to numerous companies working with blockchain technologies, which can provide a secure ledger for the creation and transfer of information.  The Covid-19 health passport proposed by SICPA, a Swiss company best known for its work on security inks for currencies and sensitive documents, combines blockchain technology with a QR code. It was developed in partnership with Guardtime, an Estonian company that recently moved its headquarters to Lausanne, to help governments manage the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.   “What our solution proposes is an attestation of the result of a test,” says Philippe Gillet, chief science officer at SICPA. “We associate the issuance of the test and the test result with the person in a very private way. We are securing the data. We are not providing any assurance as to whether the test is efficient or not.”  Another Swiss firm turning to blockchain solutions to provide governments and companies with digital health certificates is Health n Go. The company has used blockchain to distribute tickets for major sporting events in the past and proposes a QR code — acting as a sort of certificate — that can be presented on a smartphone’s wallet.   “Certificates can be revoked remotely; they can have expiry dates; or they can be centrally managed whilst preserving the data privacy of the holder,” says Frédéric Longatte, CEO of Health n Go. For example, he explains that an immunity certificate could be revoked if a batch of test kits were found to be unreliable, making the test result invalid.   But some feel it’s too soon to develop immunity passports without a full understanding of how the virus works and the ethical implications.  “The real significant risk here — setting the question aside for a second about whether and to what extent immunity exists — is that you are creating this perverse incentive for people to go out and catch the virus and develop an immunity, and this is a very dangerous, deadly virus,” says Brent Mittelstadt, a data ethics specialist at the Oxford Internet Institute.   He finds linking immunity to the right to work or the possibility of having normal access to services, shops and restaurants to be an extremely harmful stratification of society. He is also concerned about passport holders’ privacy.  “Immunity passports are being discussed as a way to basically give you back fundamental rights that have been restricted or taken away under a state of lockdown,” he says. “My main concern is using Covid-19 as a lever to get more invasive technologies through the door.”   “It’s a question of what is the baseline,” says James Davis, professor of international politics at the University of St. GallenExternal link. He sees them as a step in the right direction when the only alternative is to stay shut down for a long time until a vaccine or treatment is developed.  “I understand the concern that it would give people who have immunity an advantage, but it also provides an advantage to society as a whole because we’re opening up the economy faster,” he reckons.  Despite such concerns, the idea of linking freedom of movement to coronavirus test results appears to be gaining ground as testing becomes more widespread and countries rush to restart their economies and ease lockdowns. Chile was the first country to provide certificates to people who have recovered from Covid-19, although the Latin American nation had to backpedal and rebrand its immunity certificates as “release certificates” after weeks of global debate on whether recovered patients are actually resistant to the virus.   The pros and cons of immunity passports are being mulled in the UK and US, as well as hotly debated across Europe. German ethics experts are looking into it at the government’s request. “The question of what it means for society when some people are hit by restrictions and others are not, that touches on the foundations of how society functions together, German Health Minister Jens SpahnExternal link said earlier this month after securing millions of new coronavirus tests from Swiss drugmaker Roche.  The World Health OrganizationExternal link cautions that such certificates could increase rather than reduce the risk of continued transmission. Some people may assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result and therefore ignore public health advice.   “At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an ‘immunity passport’ or ‘risk-free certificate’,” the Geneva-based body wrote in a scientific brief.   But that assessment — like so many others made in relation to Covid-19 — could well change with new evidence.  In Switzerland, efforts are cautiously underway to assess immunity and how best to handle immunity information of recovered Covid-19 patients. The Swiss National Covid-19 Task ForceExternal link has issued a paper tackling the ethical aspects of serological tests which detect antibodies produced in response to the virus. And the Swiss School of Public HealthExternal link is developing a nationwide study on the seroprevalence of antibodies against the new coronavirus.  “Before the science shows us that these people have more protection, we have to be very careful,” says Idris Guessous, head of the primary care medicine team at the Geneva University Hospitals. “It's a matter of time before we know.”  Guessous and his colleagues are currently running large serological studies to check for Covid-19 antibodies at his lab and carrying out a random study with 6,000 people to help measure how widely the virus has spread in the Geneva area.  The two main hurdles he sees to introducing immunity passports are the low percentage of the population that has contracted the virus (estimated to be less than 10% in Switzerland) and uncertainty over whether having antibodies against Covid-19 means a reduced risk of contracting the virus again. Political and ethical hurdles must also be overcome before digital immunity certificates are introduced.  The Geneva-based researcher firmly believes in exploring immunity passport solutions so that they are ready to go if needed. That could be the case if Switzerland faces a serious second wave of infections, and it’s part of why he has teamed up with SICPA to try out their blockchain certification solution. As a starting point, says Guessous, the technology could be used to certify the presence or absence of antibodies, then evolve into an immunity certificate if there is proof that antibodies reduce the risk of infection. In the absence of a vaccine, the app could nudge people to get tested for antibodies again to ensure they remain immune.   His academic study on immunity certificates in Geneva, which will be submitted for review by an ethical committee in a few days, will also integrate a survey to help assess the general population’s openness to the idea.   “We are working on the what-if scenario,” he says. “We are doing this just in case we as a nation decide to use it. WheTther it's for the military only, whether it's for healthcare providers only, pilots only, who knows.”  But Switzerland’s Federal Office for Public Health says the introduction of Covid-19 immunity passports is not on the agenda for now.  “It’s far too early,” spokesman Grégoire Gogniat told swissinfo.ch. “Provided that we have confirmation that the antibodies do indeed lead to long-term immunity, it could make sense. It will also become relevant as soon as a vaccine is developed.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-14;Half of Swiss working from home – and enjoying it;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_half-of-switzerland-working-from-home---and-enjoying-it/45759598;Almost half of the Swiss labour force is currently working from home – and they like it, according to a survey by consultants Deloitte Switzerland.  “Teleworking appeals to many of them, so much so that they no longer wish to spend their entire working time at the office in the future,” Deloitte said in a statement on Thursday.  Some 41% of the 1,500 people surveyed said they were more productive at home, “despite less interaction with colleagues and the distraction of having children around”.  While only 25% had worked from home before the coronavirus crisis, compared with 48% currently, 34% of respondents indicated that they would want to continue working from home after the end of the lockdown measures.  “The fact is that the Covid-19 crisis […] will probably accelerate the already observed long-term trend of increased telework,” said Deloitte Switzerland.  Statistics for 2019 show that even before the pandemic working from home had become a common practice in Switzerland. Flexible working hours have also been on the rise.  So-called “home office” was practised by 33.7% of workers in Switzerland last year – 5% all the time, 14% regularly and 15% occasionally, the Federal Statistical Office reported last month.  The most common sectors were teaching, IT and communications, with over 60% of employees from these areas working from home at least once over the year.

2020-05-14;Swiss rank high in energy index ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/renewables_swiss-rank-high-in-energy-index-/45759502;Switzerland has placed second in a global index comparing current energy systems and readiness for the transition to cleaner sources. In its new Energy Transition IndexExternal link, the World Economic Forum (WEF) identifies the coronavirus pandemic as a serious threat to the switch to renewable energies. “The transformation of the energy system over the past decade, although slower than required to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, has been unprecedented. But this hard‑earned momentum now risks being lost, as the ongoing Covid‑19 pandemic continues to cause economic and social damage,” writes WEF on its website. The Energy Transition Index compares 115 countries in terms of 40 indicators, such as current energy system performance as well as investment in new energy infrastructure. Sweden, Switzerland and Finland captured the first three slots. Britain is 7th, Canada is 28th and the US is 32nd. According to WEF, the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to “consider unorthodox interventions in the energy markets”, especially if government economic stimulus packages include long-term strategies.

2020-05-14;Swiss vaccine approval: As fast as possible, as slowly as necessary;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_getting-a-vaccine-as-fast-as-possible-and-as-slowly-as-necessary-/45757286;"Dozens of labs around the world are working to find a vaccine against Covid-19. But they have embarked on a marathon rather than a sprint, because the approval procedures are lengthy, with good reason, including in Switzerland.  A vaccine by autumn? No, it's a misunderstanding. What we are hoping for is the start of phase II trials this autumn, says Lukas Jaggi, spokesman for Swissmedic, the Swiss licensing and control authority for therapeutic products. It usually takes 10-12 years from the first laboratory tests to the arrival of a product on the market. With Covid-19, the global emergency makes it possible to speed up certain stages, but not all of them. The scale of the pandemic has greatly boosted research into this new virus. Its genome was sequenced in record time, and on January 11 the Chinese authorities made the data available to researchers around the world. Laboratories have revised priorities to free up teams to work on the new coronavirus. And they can take advantage of technologies developed in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, a coronavirus related to the one that has brought the world to a standstill. The World Health Organization (WHO) website lists over 100 candidate vaccinesExternal link; most are still at the so-called pre-clinical stage, i.e. testing in cell cultures or animals. The eight most advanced projects - four Chinese, three American and one British - have entered the clinical stage, that of human trials. This takes place in three phases according to strict, internationally harmonised procedures. ·       Phase I: The product is tested on a few dozen volunteers who are in good health. The main aim is to check that it does not pose any major safety problems, and to detect the main side effects. ·       Phase II: Testing is done this time on a few hundred patients, some of whom may be suffering from the virus. The main aim is to assess its effectiveness and determine the correct dosage.  ·       Phase III: Testing at this stage can be on thousands of volunteers in different countries. The objectives are to confirm the results of Phase II – that the vaccine is safe, that it works, and the dosage is correct.    At the end of these three phases, the product can receive a marketing authorisation (MA). But having the right vaccine is not enough; it also needs to be produced and distributed in very large quantities. So if a small start-up or a university laboratory wins the race, it will have to team up with big pharma to benefit from its firepower. It should be noted that after getting marketing authorisation, the drug or vaccine remains under surveillance. An MA can be withdrawn, for example, if it turns out over time that the product has more undesirable side effects or that they are stronger than initially found. MAs are issued by each country. Whether the vaccine comes from China, the USA or elsewhere, Swissmedic will always make its own assessment, even if the product has already been authorised abroad. The Swiss authority will take into consideration trials carried out in countries with equivalent drug control.  In Switzerland, as elsewhere, people are aware of the urgency. The Federal Office of Public Health has set up a Covid-19 vaccine working group with experts from the government, Swissmedic, science and the economy. The aim is to accelerate research and development and to ensure the fastest possible access to a safe and effective vaccine,” says Lukas Jaggi. “This group also wants to help ensure equitable access to such a vaccine.   The time limits for marketing authorisation procedures are laid down in the Therapeutic Products ActExternal link and its implementing ordinance. Article 9a provides for temporary authorisation for “medicinal products for life-threatening or debilitating diseases” with a simplified procedure.  And the Ordinance on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus,External link adopted as an emergency measure on March 13 to combat the virus, even provides in Article 4 that on the basis of a risk-benefit analysis, a therapeutic product may be put on the market “without authorisation pending Swissmedic’s decision”. But all this still doesn’t tell us when we can get vaccinated. Lukas Jaggi won't say either, because the arrival of the vaccine depends first on who will produce and then manufacture it. The Swissmedic spokesman will say only that the legal and regulatory instruments are in place to allow a rapid assessment, with due regard to patient safety . Answering the question more directly, however, he adds that if all goes well, a first vaccine could be available at best by the end of the year, and larger scale vaccinations could start in 2021, if the challenge of mass production can be solved”.

2020-05-13;Swiss attorney faces possible impeachment over FIFA probe;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explainer_could-swiss-attorney-general-be-impeached-over-fifa-probe-/45756998;Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber could become the first high-ranking national official to be impeached over his handling of a FIFA corruption probe, after a key parliamentary committee meeting on Wednesday. Here’s the background.  A parliamentary judicial committee agreed unanimously on Wednesday to invite Lauber for questioning on May 20 to determine whether he broke rules or was grossly negligent. This followed motions filed by parliamentarians.  Next week’s decisive hearing could represent the first step towards possible impeachment proceedings – a historic first - against the federal prosecutor.  Switzerland’s attorney general has been criticised and is facing calls to resign over accusations that his office botched up high-profile international football trials. Last month, the first trial in Switzerland’s five-year investigation of corruption in football ended without a judgment. A five-year statute of limitations to secure convictions against former officials of the German Football Association and a former Swiss official of FIFA expired on April 28.  The four suspects allegedly misled the authorities about a CHF10 million ($10.3 million) payment linked to the 2006 World Cup hosted by Germany. The four men denied any wrongdoing and Lauber defended the handling of the case, which was suspended by the Federal Criminal Court last month amid government instructions for people older than 65 to avoid contact following the coronavirus outbreak. An independent oversight authority, AB-BAExternal link, said on March 4 that Lauber had repeatedly told falsehoods and breached a code of conduct while handling the investigation into alleged corruption around FIFA. He held undocumented meetings with FIFA Secretary General Gianni Infantino during the corruption investigation, misallocated resources and tried to block the AB-BA’s inquiry into the affair, AB-BA said. As punishment it cut Lauber’s nearly CHF300,000 ($309,000) salary by 8% for one year. Last year, Lauber was recused from his involvement in FIFA investigations by Switzerland’s federal criminal court. The federal prosecutor has defended his handling of the case. The attorney general’s office told the Reuters news agency that it regretted that “no judicial assessment could be made” in the case of the four football officials. Lauber has also appealed to the Federal Administrative Court against the watchdog’s findings and his salary cut. Lauber’s office said the AB-BA decision did not “represent a conclusive finding and must stand up to judicial review.”  He issued no new comment ahead of Wednesday’s committee meeting.  Lauber cannot be dismissed as easily as some parliamentarians may want. Removal from office is a formal act, which must follow certain rules.  As such a procedure would be a first, the committee is keen to ensure that it is conducted “correctly, beyond reproach and safeguarding our institutions”, according to Andrea Caroni, chairman of the judicial committee. In order to clarify preliminary questions, Caroni invited an expert from the Federal Office of Justice and a law professor to Wednesday’s meeting.  The committee will now decide whether to open formal proceedings after Lauber’s hearing on May 20. The rest of the timetable remains open.  If the committee agrees to go ahead with impeachment proceedings, they must be validated by a vote by the two chambers of parliament – the House of Representatives and the Senate - in a joint session. Lauber critics would like to push ahead and for parliament to vote this summer. However, others would prefer to wait for the Federal Administrative Court appeal ruling on the watchdog’s findings.  Last September, parliament re-elected Lauber for a third term despite months of controversy over his handling of the FIFA corruption investigation. The big question remains: can Lauber continue to fight or might he throw in the towel this time? This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-13;Covid-19: Government announces multi-million package for sports sector ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economic-aid_covid-19--government-announces-multi-million-package-for-sports-sector-/45757424;The government has pledged CHF500 million ($515 million) to support sports clubs and associations in Switzerland hit by restrictions introduced to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.  More than half of that sum will be provided to professional football and hockey leagues in the form of loans to guarantee their viability until the end of the 2020-2021 season.  The government earmarked CHF350 million to the leagues, with the first CHF175 million in loans designed to make up for revenue lost between June 1 and the end of 2020. If matches can take place only in a limited capacity for a year, the other half of that sum will be added to the 2021 government budget.  Many sports competitions have been cancelled or postponed since the end of February because of the pandemic. The Swiss Super League postponed football matches, which can resume on June 8 following the relaxation of lockdown measures. However, the league had raised concerns about lingering financial and health and safety issues.  Viola Amherd, the minister responsible for sport, told the media on Wednesday that some 1.7% of the country’s GDP was linked directly to sports. But the sector was not just of economic importance – it encompassed leisure and health activities and was part of Swiss culture.    “Sport plays a central role in our society,” she said.  The loans will be subject to certain requirements, including guaranteeing training for young talent under pre-outbreak conditions.   The government is also allocating an additional CHF50 million for 2020 and CHF100 million for 2021 to sports associations and organisations in urgent need of financial assistance. This comes on top of a grant of CHF50 million already approved by the government to prevent lasting losses for these sporting structures, which rely heavily on volunteers.   The funds come in addition to a CHF66 billion economic aid package unveiled earlier in the crisis and will need to be approved by parliament.  The government is also looking into offering loans to the roughly 60 sporting federations headquartered in Switzerland, some of which are facing financial insolvency following the cancellation of large-scale events. The International Olympic Committee, which along with football governing bodies FIFA and UEFA would be excluded from state aid, would provide half of the funds.   On Wednesday the government also announced it would prolong by four months the period during which cultural institutions can have access to financial aid. In March it had earmarked CHF280 million ($289 million) to mitigate the economic consequences of lockdown measures on the cultural sector, originally for a two-month period.   As part of a gradual easing of Covid-19 measures, training for all sports at amateur and professional levels resumed on May 11. Some museums and libraries also re-opened their doors. Sports activities can now take place in groups no larger than five people. The ban on large gatherings remains in place until the end of August 2020.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-13;Swiss to re-open borders with neighbouring countries;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/free-movement_swiss-in-talks-with-neighbours-about-re-opening-borders/45756568;Switzerland is planning to re-open its borders with Germany, France and Austria as part of a gradual loosening of restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic imposed in March. Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the four countries had agreed in principleExternal link on the coordinated re-introduction of the free movement of people by June 15. Discussions with my counterparts have shown a common intention to go back to normality, also at the borders, provided the epidemiological situation allows us to do so, she told a news conference on Wednesday. Tourism can resume between the three countries from mid-June, provided the conditions are right, she confirmed.  Certain restrictions could be eased beforehand, possibly already this weekend, according to Keller-Sutter. She said talks were underway to define the details of preliminary measures, notably for family reasons or property owners. The announcement follows similar statements by the German and Austrian governments. However, the resumption of international railway links, student exchange programmes or cross-border shopping trips would have to wait for the next phase in the Swiss government's Covid-19 exit strategy to be decided at the end of this month. Migration restrictions between Switzerland and Austria have already been eased in the past few weeks. There were no immediate plans to unblock the borders with Italy, one of the hotbeds of the pandemic in Europe. Keller-Sutter declined to give a date, saying a coordinated approach also with other European countries was necessary.  Currently only cross-border workers can cross into Switzerland from Italy. The European Union has warned that the free movement of people policy must be re-introduced once the Covid-19 epidemic is brought under control. Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but it is part of the single-border Schengen agreement. Some of the main north-south transit routes in Europe run through Switzerland - a popular holiday destination notably for German visitors. Borders were closed in mid-March as part of wide-ranging restrictions on public life and business activities. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

It is set to receive CHF30 million. Switzerland is also making contributions to the Wellcome Trust Foundation and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which facilitate access to Covid-19 diagnostic and therapeutic products in the developing world.  The government is also providing an additional CHF50 million to step up humanitarian assistance in response to appeals from international organisations and to support bilateral aid projects.  A final CHF2.5 million will go to the World Health Organization (WHO).   The CHF175 million are part of an international aid package totalling CHF400 million announced two weeks ago to fight the pandemic. The government had already decided to issue half of that amount as an interest-free loan to the International Committee of the Red Cross and to make a contribution to the disaster fund of the International Monetary Fund.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-13;The future of handshaking;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_the-future-of-handshaking/45756606;"Coronavirus can transform our habits and our ideas of living together in Europe, write law researchers Ashley Mantha-Hollands and Liav Orgad. When asked about handshaking recently, the US’s lead virologist Dr. Fauci saidExternal link: ‘I don’t think we should ever shake hands again’, referring to how it would prevent both coronavirus and seasonal influenza. In Europe, where the topic of the handshake has been a landmine in recent years, this medical requirement can lead to a much-needed cultural shift.  In 2010, an Algerian woman was denied citizenship in FranceExternal link for not shaking hands with the male official at the Préfecture de l’Isère. In 2016, a civil registrar in BrusselsExternal link refused to marry a couple when the bride declined to shake his hand during the ceremony. In the Netherlands, an application for a bus-driver position was rejected in 2017 because the person refused to shake hands with female passengers and colleagues. And in Switzerland, refusing to shake hands led the city of Lausanne to reject a citizenship application in 2018. The city of Therwil, in the Canton of Basel-Landschaft, even imposed a fine of CHF5,000 ($5,150) and social services on parents whose children refused to shake the hands of a female teacher in school. Simonetta Sommaruga, the current Swiss President (then, the Federal Minister of Justice) fiercely claimed that handshaking is “part of the Swiss culture”. The education authorities were more explicit—“a teacher has a right to demand a handshake”. The strictest handshake policy in Europe takes place in Denmark. In December 2018, handshaking hit the headlines when Denmark passed a law that has made handshaking mandatory in all naturalization ceremonies. Refusing to shake the hand of the mayor or other officials in the ceremony can end with denying citizenship. Interestingly, since the outbreak of the pandemic, Denmark has frozen all citizenship ceremonies under the slogan of “no handshake, no citizenship.”External link On the surface, handshaking is just a form of greeting, not fundamentally different than waving, smiling, or bowing (or, if you prefer, elbow bumping, head nodding, and air kissing). Yet, in the increasingly diverse European societies, the handshake has become essential for “living together”.  The principle of living together shocked Europe back in 2014, when the European Court of Human RightsExternal link upheld the French burqa ban. The court ruled that the question of whether a woman “should be permitted to wear a full-face veil in public places is a choice of society”. According to the court, living together requires minimum social interaction and community life as defined by the state.  Covering one’s face in public is currently seen through the eyes of the Covid-19 crisis, as an act of civic duty to protect vulnerable members of society. Austria, Slovakia, Germany, and France have recommended or implemented a duty to wear masks in public spacesExternal link. Face covers allow us to participate in public life, not to recoil from it. What is important is facilitating participation in public life, not whether you can see a person’s smile; living together, not a fixed notion and understanding what living together means.  The Covid-19 crisis has temporarily destabilized our social interactions, thereby bringing about an opportunity to reflect on alternative greetingsExternal link in European ways of life. Instead of holding on to past conventions, policymakers should be more tolerant of different modes of greeting and reasons for different dress codes. The obligation to not shake hands and to cover one’s face because of the pandemic shows that these etiquettes are not as necessary to social life as has been presumed.  This article was first published on VerfassungsblogExternal link The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-05-13;How do Switzerland’s Covid billions measure up internationally?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_how-do-switzerland-s-covid-billions-look-compared-internationally-/45754852;Most governments have announced unprecedented levels of public spending to support their economies in the face of the coronavirus crisis. With its CHF65 billion ($66.9 billion) plan, Switzerland is among the countries that are freeing up the most funds.  The coronavirus pandemic has led to a collapse of activity in many sectors around the world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global economy to contractExternal link by 3% in 2020, which it says would be “the worst recession since the Great Depression” of the 1930s – far worse than the financial crisis of 2008. + ‘Switzerland is going to face an unimaginable level of poverty’External link In an attempt to limit the damage to the economy and create the conditions for recovery, most governments have taken unprecedented measures to support households, businesses and financial markets. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentExternal link (OECD), for example, reports that all of its 37 member countries have announced some form of financial support for businesses, the vast majority of which are supplementing the incomes of workers hit hard by the crisis.  The scale of such plans is unprecedented: at the end of March – other measures have since been announced – the financial information site Barron’s already estimated that the total cost of these extraordinary packages could exceed $10 trillionExternal link (CHF9.7 trillion).  In Switzerland, parliament met in an extraordinary sessionExternal link on May 4 and gave the go-ahead for the release of CHF57 billion in urgent credits to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Never before has parliament had to decide on such a large amount. A debt of up to CHF8 billion is still expected to be incurred for short-time working compensation, bringing the potential impact of the crisis on federal finances to more than CHF65 billionExternal link.  International comparisons are difficult to make. This is partly because policy responses are influenced by a variety of country-specific circumstances. They depend, for example, on the social safety nets that existed before the crisis. It is also because not all measures are equal: some are additional and unforeseen public expenditures that will never be compensated, while others consist of loans or deferrals of payments that sooner or later will be due.  As an indication, however, it can be said that Switzerland ranks among the countries with the highest share of wealth devoted to fiscal measures and exceptional public spending, according to an IMF analysisExternal link. Based on the estimates provided by the IMF, swissinfo.ch has calculated that the average share of GDP devoted to such plans is 6.8% in the OECD. In Switzerland it is more than 9%. Switzerland is also one of the countries with the highest overall amount of such measures in terms of population (around CHF7,500 per capita), behind only Luxembourg (in first place with CHF17,500 per capita in a country of 626,000 inhabitants) and Japan (over CHF8,400 per capita). At the global level, Japan and the United States are among the countries that have mobilised the most funds, with packages amounting to trillions of dollars. In the United States, one of the key measures – and also one of the most expensive in the stimulus package – is direct aid to all Americans in a certain income bracket.  Japan is the country that is spending the largest share of its GDP (21%), with a package of measures amounting to more than 117 trillion yen (more than CHF1 trillion). In particular, it includes direct payments to households and small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to the tune of 6 trillion yen.  On the European side, the Luxembourg plan includes various additional public spending measures amounting to more than CHF2 billion. Measures to support companies and the self-employed in their liquidity needs account for the bulk of the plan (more than CHF8 billion), following the example of Switzerland.

2020-05-12;Swiss coronavirus epicentre Ticino reports no new deaths or infections;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-coronavirus-epicentre-ticino-reports-no-new-deaths-or-infections/45755106;Italian-speaking canton Ticino, in the south of Switzerland, has reported no new fatalities or infections for the first time since the virus was recorded there in late February.  For the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, there have been no new deaths of cases of infection in Ticino, which borders Italy, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) said on May 12. Ticino was where the first coronavirus case was reported on February 25, and which introduced the first emergency restrictions to curb the spread of the disease. It has been one of the worst-affected Swiss regions, alongside Geneva, Vaud and Zurich. According to consolidated figures that come directly from the cantons, Switzerland reported a total of 30,201 cases on May 12, and 1,857 coronavirus-related deaths.  On Tuesday, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) reported 36 new cases over the past 24 hours. The number of new positive cases has been below 100 for over one week now.  After an eight-week partial lockdown, emergency restrictions are being slowly eased in Switzerland as the virus situation improves.  After several shops and professions were opened or allowed to operate from April 27, during a second phase from May 11 restaurants, bars, shops, museums and other culture institutions have re-opened under strict conditions and primary and lower secondary schools have resumed classes. There has also been a gradual relaxation of some strict controls on entry into the country. A third phase of easing is planned from June 8. However, a ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people remains in place and the government has urged people to continue to heed hygiene standards, notably social distancing and handwashing.  Major events involving more than 1,000 people – notably cultural festivals – will not be allowed until at least the end of August.

However, events with more than 1,000 people – notably festivals and sporting events – are currently not allowed until the end of August at the earliest. The organisers of the Diamond League athletics meeting in Zurich in September have decided not to wait for any upcoming announcements by the Federal Council on large gatherings and sports events.  On Tuesday they announced a revamped calendar of Diamond League meetings. Meetings in Zurich, London and Rabat have been cancelled while others have been rescheduled to “adapt the season in the face of the coronavirus crisis.” Zurich will now hold the Diamond League finals in 2021 and now also in 2022. World sport has seen countless events scrapped and seasons cut short due to the global pandemic. In Switzerland a long list of championships, races and events have been cancelled or postponed since the end of February. These include the Engadin Ski marathon, numerous World Cup ski races and the Ice Hockey World Championship. The Swiss Super League football matches were postponed on February 28. The government has now given permission for games to restart on June 8 and teams returned to training on May 11. However, the football league said there were still numerous financial and health issues to be resolved. The league is due to make a decision at an assembly on May 29 and a resumption before June 20 looks unlikely.  As part of the government’s easing of unprecedented Covid-19 restrictions, from May 11 training can be resumed for all sports at both amateur and professional levels. Sports activities may only take place in small groups of a maximum of five persons, without physical contact and in compliance with the rules of hygiene and social distancing. At the end of May, the government is set to decide whether to ease the ban on gatherings of more than five people, the re-opening of universities and other institutes of higher education, as well as sports competitions with spectators, religious services and tourist transport facilities in the mountains.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-12;Coronavirus tracing app designed for Swiss restaurant owners and clients;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eating-out_coronavirus-tracing-app-designed-for-swiss-restaurant-owners-and-clients/45754010;The Swiss hospitality industry has developed a smartphone application that allows the secure transfer of contact details from customers to restaurant owners via a QR code to assist with contact tracing efforts.   The easing of coronavirus restrictions in Switzerland has meant that people can frequent bars and restaurants from May 11. However, the government wants eating establishments to request the contact details of their clients to help with virus contact tracing. Customers, meanwhile, are not obliged to share their telephone numbers due to data protection laws and can only be encouraged to do so voluntarily.  In order to assuage privacy concerns, two companies specialising in hospitality software - Hotelpro4u and SwissHelios Sàrl – have developed smartphone applications to facilitate the secure transfer of client information.   When the system is operational, customers will be able to download the CovidPass app and enter their contact information on their own mobile phone. This will be transformed into a secure encrypted QR code ensuring that their personal data does not leave their phone.  Restaurant owners can then download the GastroCovid app and scan their customer's QR Code or manually enter the customer's details, which will be stored on secured servers. This data is not accessible to the restaurant owner and will be destroyed automatically after 14 days. The information also includes date, time, table number and server name.   Only authorised personnel of the cantonal health services can request and access the data stored on secured servers via a secure key. The implementation of a blockchain model guarantees access to the data only to the cantonal health services, according to the developers.   The health authorities can check the restaurant's database when a patient who has tested positive reveals that he or she went to the establishment during the contagious phase.   The developers claim that the apps respect federal law on data protection. The apps are expected to be available on the Apple and Google Play stores this week.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-12;Nurses in Switzerland: stressed out and underpaid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo-investigation_nurses-in-switzerland--stressed-out-and-underpaid/45751758;Nurses are hard at work right now dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. But even apart from difficult times like these, hospital work can be exhausting and frustrating. There are consequences for patient care. What is the real state of health of the nursing profession in Switzerland today? The old lady died during the night. No-one had ever come to see her. It was a long hospital stay and a slow decline without any visits from family or friends. Jennifer S.* was at her bedside. “I can still hear her last breath. I did not want her to die alone.” A year after this tragic event, the young nurse in a cantonal hospital in central Switzerland is still shaken. It was the first time she had seen someone die. But Jennifer S. (21) knows that being with patients in the last moments of their lives is part and parcel of her job. And it’s really why she became a nurse. “I wanted to do something useful for society, for people.” This idealism already took a beating during her days as a student nurse. Jennifer S. talks about exhausting shifts, irregular working hours and continual changes of plan. The work hierarchy is authoritarian, and discontentment and disillusionment widespread among the staff, she says. Most of all, the nurse shares her frustration at having too little time to watch over the patients’ healing process. “No-one talks about the problems in hospitals. There’s a conspiracy of silence. I’d like to go demonstrate out in the streets. But then who is going to look after the patients?”, she says. Sylvie F. (26) in Geneva, decided to become a nurse because of the contact with the patients. A smile or a word of thanks from a departing patient are the most gratifying things, she says. At her first job in a hospital following four years of study, she has realised, however, that the job is different from what she imagined. “If I could, I would change jobs,” she admits. On a day shift she looks after six patients, and it’s twelve on a night shift. She also has to answer the phone, arrange admissions and discharges, fill out forms, and talk to family members about the health of their loved ones. “There are always too few of us, and absences don’t get filled in. There are cases of burnout, but they are covered up,” she says. Melanie T., a nurse working in pediatrics and maternity, had a burnout after 14 years working in regional hospitals in canton Zurich. “It’s a terrific job,” she says. “But if you don’t have that inner motivation, you get sick.” The nurse tells about getting burned out due to mobbing by her superiors, after an absence for health reasons. “At a certain point you just can’t manage any more and you collapse, but that doesn’t interest the employer,” she says. Jennifer, Sylvie and Melanie are not isolated cases, says Pierre-André Wagner, manager of legal services for the Swiss Nurses’ AssociationExternal link. “In the healthcare industry there are abuses that would be unacceptable in any other sector. Labour law is constantly being flouted,” he argues. In his office in Bern, the lawyer and qualified nurse has analysed hundreds of cases. And he has plenty of examples of abuses. “Someone who is no longer able to do night shifts for health reasons loses their job. Someone who exposes abuses becomes a victim of mobbing. Someone who opposes rationalisation that negatively impacts the quality of care is accused of lack of loyalty to the institution,” Wagner wrote in the association’s monthly magazine.  Yet to generalise all this and criticise the entire nursing sector in Switzerland – which employs 214,000 people – would not be right either, he concedes. There are many differences between one ward or hospital and the next, and there are institutions in which staff feel satisfied and supported by management. Yet by and large, frustration and disaffection with the job are widespread, Wagner says. Owing to stress, an unbalanced shift system and pay rates found to be too low, one in two health-care workers has expressed a desire to change careers before retirement age. This is the finding of a 2019 opinion survey by the trade union Unia. Every year, 2,400 nurses quit the profession. This is an “alarming” situation caused by the growing predominance of economic considerations in the way healthcare work is organised, the union said. “In the name of profitability there is rationalisation, costs are cut, there are budget cuts, and at the same time, the disastrous effects of this on working conditions and the quality of care are studiously ignored,” says Yvonne Peist-Gaillet of Unia. According to Wagner, the situation deteriorated in 2012 with the introduction of the SwissDRG tariff systemExternal link. “Hospitals are under economic pressure and budgetary restrictions that they can only respond to by cutting staff costs,” he says. Devised to keep down healthcare costs and encourage hospitals to compete, SwissDRG regulates the fees for all hospital services on the basis of a lump sum per case (previously a daily rate was charged). The current system – which, the federal government says, has got Swiss hospitals to operate more efficiently External link– is the symptom of a healthcare policy that has jettisoned the idea of serving the public and has subjected public health to capitalist imperatives, says Wagner. The emergency in hospitals due to the coronavirus, he points out, has just shown up “all the deleterious effects of commercialisation of public health on the health care system.” Wagner puts it bluntly: “Patient care is being ruined by a healthcare system dominated by the desire for power and money. The patient is not the focus of things anymore.” In Switzerland, he says, tens of thousands of patients fall victim to complications that could be avoided, just because there is a push to save on nursing costs. He also deplores the increased hiring of healthcare assistant staffExternal link, with lower skills and lower pay, rather than nurses with degrees. There is scientific proof that cuts to nursing staff, whether in terms of qualifications or staffing numbers, mean an increase in complications and mortality rates, says Wagner. His conclusion is corroborated by a recent study External linkby professors at Bern and Basel universities, which found that increasing the number of nurses in hospitals would mean hundreds of deaths less, apart from saving millions of francs. Inadequate monitoring of a patient can cause bed sores, treatment of which causes CHF50,000 on average, a fall or a thrombosis, Wagner points out. Nurses, midwives, laboratory assistants, assistant physicians: the whole healthcare sector is under pressure, says Wagner. Currently in Switzerland only 56% of the needed staff are being trained. In the nursing sector, the situation is even more critical and new graduates number only 43%. By 2030, 65,000 degree-level nurses will be needed, says the association, which intends to do something about the lack via a people’s initiative (details below). The problem of being short-staffed is compounded by what Wagner defines as a mixture of “machismo and power-tripping”. The model of the patriarchal physician commanding an army of nurses no longer exists, he says. “But there is still a generation of doctors there who think they are infallible and won’t accept any suggestion or observation from nurses – the ones who are closest to the patient.” Hierarchies have to be respected, with the risk that “valuable knowledge and skill among nursing staff is not taken into account”, and patients’ health suffers. The nurse is aware of the right decisions to make in the light of the ethical framework she has subscribed to, but she may not be able to put them into effect due to lack of time, lack of interest by superiors, or the policy of the institution, says Wagner. “This causes real inner suffering which leads to frustration and burnout.” Another “widespread” problem that Wagner uncovers is sexual harassment. His booklet on how to behave in cases of harassment from patients has been distributed in 140,000 copies. The problem was documented by a study External linkof the federal government in 2008, which found that healthcare staff run a very high risk of sexual harassment and even physical attacks. Statistics are not available for Switzerland. According to World Health Organization (WHOExternal link) global estimates, 8-38% of health workers suffer physical violence at least once in their career. A study carried out in Italy in 2019 by the Nursing up union found that one in ten nurses has had to deal with physical violence on the job in the past year. Four per cent were threatened with guns, and half of them experienced verbal aggression. “Harassment goes on mainly in emergency wards, psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and home care. Anyone who experiences this feels really torn: there is the bad feeling they get, and then the moral dilemma because they are being harassed by people they want to heal,” notes Wagner, who until 2019 was vice-president of the Federal Commission for Women’s Issues. In spite of the concerns expressed by unions and professional bodies, the situation of nursing staff in Switzerland turns out to be not so bad in international comparison. In opinion surveys carried out in EuropeExternal link, Switzerland is one of the countries with the highest level of satisfaction with working conditions and job satisfaction. The Alpine nation has one of the highest numbers of nurses per head of population, and on average, a nurse in a hospital here is responsible for the care of eight patients, compared to 13 in Germany. “In France, Germany and most likely also in Italy, the picture is much worse,” admits Wagner. “This is shown by the fact that Switzerland is still a magnet for foreign nurses.” One third of nursing staff in Swiss hospitals are from abroad, especially from the neighbouring countries. This results in a problematic situation for two reasons, he points out. “The brain-drain to Switzerland means a lack of staff elsewhere. Furthermore, with better conditions than they had in their home countries, foreign nurses in Switzerland don’t have much motivation to work for change here,” he says. The lack of staff is confirmed by the Swiss Hospitals’ Association (H+External link), which acknowledges the physical and mental burden weighing on employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The causes of short staffing are various, swissinfo.ch was told in an e-mail from Dorit Djelid, head of communication for H+. “With patients aging and the multi-morbidity that goes with that trend, the shortfall in nursing care is getting worse. For years now, Switzerland has been training too few people at professional level in nursing care, and the solution has been to recruit abroad. Furthermore, the nursing profession is a very stressful one, and the attrition rate is higher than in other occupations, which just serves to aggravate the shortage,” he says. H+ also points out, though, that between 2011 and 2018  nursing staff in hospitals and clinics increased by 14%, versus an increase in the number of hospitalisations of 7%. “To claim that we have to do more and more with fewer staff is thus mistaken in the case of most institutions. The number of nurses per patient has remained constant and in some places it has even increased. The documentation tasks have increased, though, due to computerisation in the nursing sector,” says Djelid. The Swiss Health Observatory also emphasises that the indicators regarding staffing since 2013 have shown there is stability of employment in hospitals. However, Clémence Merçay of the Observatory admits: “We know next to nothing about how the proportion of patient contact has been evolving in comparison with administrative tasks.”  Trade unionists accuse them of putting economic considerations before the welfare of staff, while H+ retorts that hospitals have to cope with the same economic restrictions as other industries. “But unlike the private sector, hospitals are subject to a system of set fees and services which give them little room to manoeuvre given their rather meagre financial resources,” says Djelid. This is a situation that concerns all the professional categories in hospitals, not just nurses. The two sides seem to agree on one point: the government keeps tightening hospitals’ purse strings. “The reductions in fees imposed by the federal government, and initiatives calling for reduced costs, would be an example. From the hospitals’ point of view, the resources we have are clearly insufficient to meet the needs in terms of nursing care and to boost training here in Switzerland,” says Djelid. For Wagner, the cure for the ailment affecting nurses can be put in a few words: make the profession more attractive. Denouncing the more outrageous abuses and taking them to court can be of help in extreme cases. In 2001, the association and the unions won a considerable judicial battle when a court in Zurich found there was pay discrimination based on the sex of employees, and imposed an increase in monthly pay of CHF500-800 for nurses in the canton. However, the lawyer admits, these actions tend to shift the problem elsewhere. “If the hospital is obliged to accept that time spent changing and getting to the ward is work time, it will try to save money some other way. For example, by reducing break time. The hospitals actually have their hands tied. They don’t flout labour law just for the fun of it. They just can’t afford to obey it,” he says. The Nurses’ Association is thus asking the government to boost its investment in training and in the hospitals. “We need to be sure that a sufficient number of nurses are trained in Switzerland, that they then stay in the profession and that their skills are recognised and put to use,” says Roswitha Koch, head of nursing care development at the association. WHO, in dedicating this year to nurses and midwives, has called for increased investment External linkin the healthcare sector. “It is said that a person who saves a life is a hero. A person who saves hundreds of lives is obviously a nurse,” Margaret Chan, WHO’s then director-general said in 2015. “That person is likely to be overworked, underpaid, and vastly under‐appreciated.” If Swiss politicians don’t do enough, the association intends to carry its 2017 initiative “for stronger nursing careExternal link” to a popular vote. The resolution calls for a sufficient number of degree-level nurses in Switzerland and an upgrading of the profession, with better pay, working conditions that fit in with family responsibilities, and more professional discretion on the job for nursing staff. However, the two chambers of parliament, along with the government, do not support the initiative. They prefer a counter-proposalExternal link that encourages more training to reduce dependence on staffing from abroad, but without any undertaking to improve working conditions or make the profession more attractive. Voters will probably get to decide on the future of the Swiss healthcare system – reputed to be one of the world’s best – in 2021. *Some names have been changed to protect anonymity, except where first and last name are both given.

The canton had opted for a full re-start, and only 2% of pupils had not turned up – which was better than expected. This showed that parents had trust in the canton’s approach, he said. The canton had previously come under criticism from some teachers and parents that it had not opted for a staggered return.  In French-speaking canton Fribourg, which is running a staggered return, the number of pupil no-shows was also low, officials said, and there were enough teachers.  + Schools re-opening hit by lack of teachers External link Italian-speaking canton Ticino, which has been the most strongly affected by the coronavirus as it borders Italy, has also opted for half classes. SRF reportedExternal link that fears that a second wave of infections could come were higher there than in the German-speaking part of the country.

2020-05-11;Top Swiss health official optimistic about infection rates;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-restrictions-eased_top-swiss-health-official-optimistic-about-infection-rates/45752348;The Swiss government’s delegate on the coronavirus says he is optimistic about containing the pandemic despite the further easing of restrictions in the country. Daniel Koch said he was convinced that the rate of infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to Covid-19 could drop even further. “Provided people continue to respect the rules on hygiene and social distancing, further restrictions on public life can be lifted soon,” Koch told a news conference on Monday. He said he felt relieved about the current situation, which has seen rates of new infections and deaths drop in recent weeks. As of Monday, the country had registered over 30,000 infections and 1,837 deaths. “I’m not worried about a sudden rise in the number of figures because of the easing of restrictions. I trust in people’s sense of responsibility.” His comments came as shops and restaurants re-opened, school classes for children under the age of 16 resumed and public transport re-introduced regular services. However, a ban on mass events, including concerts and sports competitions as well as church services, has remained in place. Gatherings of more than five people are also still outlawed under emergency rules imposed by the government in mid-March. Koch said the current trend of declining Covid-19 cases was the result of the population’s discipline in heeding the safety rules. The next step in the government’s strategy is to resume a strict tracing of patients and their environment to avoid the virus spreading again, Koch said. He urged all people with flu-like symptoms to get tested for Covid-19. He also assured elderly people or those with pre-existing health conditions that it was safe to leave their homes and apartments while respecting the safety precautions. The Federal Health Office has also issued updated recommendations for cantonal authorities on easing conditions for visits to nursing homes. Meanwhile, a senior defence ministry official says Switzerland now has enough medical equipment – including protective masks, gloves and ventilators – to cope with a new crisis. Martin Näf said the government had provided up to 18 million hygiene masks for sale in retail shops and both national and cantonal authorities had a stock of material that could last for at least 40 days. He pointed out that Switzerland had always kept a stock of face masks over the past weeks and months, dismissing reports of shortages. Näf said Switzerland would continue to buy additional supplies, and that it has so far only used a small part of the CHF2.45 billion ($2.5 billion) budget set aside by parliament to acquire such material.

2020-05-11;Proportion of foreign prisoners drops to 15-year low;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-jails_proportion-of-foreign-prisoners-drops-to-15-year-low/45752402;The number of foreign inmates in Swiss prisons, though still almost 70%, is at its lowest point in 15 years, according to annual statistics. As of January 2020, a total of 4,807 foreign nationals were imprisoned in Switzerland, from a total inmate number of 6,906, the Federal Statistical Office reportedExternal link on Monday. Some 267 of these non-Swiss prisoners were facing deportation to their country of origin. The number of foreign prisoners is down 4% on last year, Marcelo Aebi, a criminologist at the University of Lausanne, told the Keystone-SDA news agency. + Why are so many prisoners in Swiss jails foreign? Overall, a decrease of 1% in total prisoner numbers was recorded since January 2019. Aebi said movements within a range of plus or minus 5% represent “stability”. He predicted that the very slight downward trend could continue as a result of Covid-19-enforced border closures, which will likely hamper the operations of cross-border criminal gangs. Swiss prisons have a total of 7,390 places, which means they are operating at 93.5% capacity. However, according to another criminologist, André Kuhn of the University of Neuchâtel, the situation differs across the country: in French-speaking Switzerland prisons are over-populated and are thus also less inclined to put someone in provisional detention than a prison in, say, Basel. As for the effects of the coronavirus, although imprisonments have decreased, paroles have also gone down. Hearings and committees have been affected by health and safety measures, Kuhn said, and fewer prisoners are being allowed out on conditional release. Of the 6,906 total prisoners, 401 (5.8%) were women. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-11;Households save around CHF2,000 during Covid-19 pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_households-save-around-chf2-000-during-covid-19-pandemic/45752010;Swiss households have saved an average of CHF2,000 ($2,060) more during the coronavirus crisis than in normal times. Although incomes have generally fallen, much less is being spent owing to store closures, according to a study by Credit Suisse.  The savings ratio – the proportion of income that a household puts aside after deducting all expenditures – almost doubled during the crisis, according to the bank’s report, published on Monday.  It said that before the crisis, the Swiss put around 13% of their gross income per household into the piggy bank – without compulsory savings such as pensions. This ratio is now likely to have risen to 22%.  This is because the possibilities to spend money are very limited. Normally around a third of consumer spending is on goods and services – options that are either unavailable or hard to obtain because of measures to contain the virus.  Even online shopping does not compensate for these losses, according to the authors of the study. At 15% the online share of overall retail trade, i.e. the food and non-food sector, has increased but remains comparatively low.  The study estimates consumer demand during the crisis to be around 20% lower overall than before. Calculated over a period of two months, this would mean total savings of CHF12 billion.  But while the crisis has affected savings, it has also affected incomes: a two-month lockdown will lead to a total loss of income of around CHF15.3 billion, according to the bank’s calculations. This would be caused, for example, by reduced wages due to short-time work, unemployment or other work restrictions.  Some of these losses are cushioned by government payments, such as short-time work and employment compensation or daily allowances. Credit Suisse expects government payments of around CHF11.6 billion over a two-month period of restrictions.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-11;Why the Swiss are reluctant to wear face masks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/easing-the-lockdown_why-the-swiss-are-reluctant-to-wear-face-masks/45751636;As Switzerland eases up on the lockdown, more people are out and about but very few Swiss are wearing masks in public. Why is that? An unscientific look at what’s behind the reluctance. The debate on whether people should wear face masks in public has been going on for weeks. Experts and the government disagree, which has fueled even more discussion as the country reopens much of the economy this week. Despite the raging discourse on the topic, it is relatively rare to encounter people wearing masks on the streets in Switzerland. This is in part due to a mask shortage. It wasn’t until last week that masks were available for purchase in shops and this meant that masks were quite expensive. But the reasons go beyond mere practicalities. The limited mask sightings also stem from the attitudes and views on wearing masks in Switzerland. Many immigrants from countries where wearing a mask has become a part of everyday life, have trouble understanding the Swiss reluctance to wear one. swissinfo.ch took a small - and not representative - survey of readers and Swiss residents to understand what is going on. One reason is that there is simply no tradition of wearing masks in Switzerland in the way there is in some Asian countries, many of which suffered from the SARS epidemic two decades ago. Before the coronavirus outbreak, no one wore a mask in public in Switzerland. Even today, those wearing masks are viewed as overly cautious and concerned with protecting themselves. In other words, people are wearing a mask to protect themselves not others. In the absence of a mask wearing tradition, people need to be convinced that changing habits makes sense. However, some in our survey said that there remain doubts about the effectiveness of wearing a mask. For example, someone on Facebook said, “I have read a lot that it [wearing a mask] can be counterproductive and now I don’t know what is right anymore.” Another argued that “I think that wearing one can affect our breathing.” The government and many employers recommend that people wear masks on public transportation or when it isn’t possible to maintain a distance of two metres such as in a hair salon. As a result, many follow these recommendations but don’t go beyond this. Some readers commented that masks aren’t necessary when the public follows social distancing and hygiene rules. There are also environmental concerns at play. One reader wrote, Gloves and masks will be lying around in the garbage. That makes me think. That certainly does no one any good. Above all, our planet. In our spontaneous survey of readers, many people said they don’t wear a mask because they either feel healthy or because they had already contracted Covid-19 and recovered. However, experts have said that there is still a lot we don’t know about how much immunity people have after Covid-19 and how much asymptomatic people can transmit the virus.

2020-05-11;Few masks or commuters seen in Swiss stations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_few-masks-or-commuters-seen-in-swiss-train-stations/45750968; As the second stageExternal link of easing the Covid-19 lockdown begins in Switzerland, the main train stations in Bern and Zurich lacked their usual bustle, despite public transport returning largely to normal.  In the Swiss capital Bern on Monday the first intercity trains to and from Zurich and the western Swiss city of Lausanne were moderately busy, so distancing rules could be observed without any problems. Only a few passengers were wearing protective face masks on trains and in the station.  Transport companies recommend passengers wear a mask when space is tight and urge people to avoid unnecessary travel. Commuters have been told to avoid rush hours and to switch to less-popular routes whenever possible.  Many Swiss people are expected to continue working from home. What’s more, vocational and secondary schools will not resume normal operations until June 8.  Compulsory schools (with pupils up to the age of 16) are re-opening, albeit to a lesser extent. Shops, cafés, restaurants, fitness centres, libraries and museums are also allowed to open, provided they have taken precautions.  However, complete normality is still a long way off. Social rules to combat the coronavirus pandemic still apply. Outside the home, a minimum distance of two metres must be maintained.  Meanwhile, many shops tried to attract customers with discounts on the first open day. In some places, clothes were up to 30% cheaper, leading to occasional queues. Access to shops remains limited, as only one person per ten square metres is allowed into outlets. The floors of the shops are partly covered with distance markings and directional arrows. Some places provide staff and customers with protective masks on request.  In restaurants only four people or a family are allowed per table. The minimum distance between tables must be maintained or there must be a partition. Bars and restaurants must ask for a guest’s contact information, but the guest is not obliged to give it. Restaurant staff must clean and disinfect after each guest. In Ticino, the Italian-speaking southern canton which has been particularly affected by the coronavirus, roads were quite busy despite wet weather in the capital Bellinzona. Only a few people were wearing protective masks. Cafés were around half full, mainly with young men drinking espressos.

2020-05-11;Disadvantaged groups almost five times more exposed to Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/virus-and-inequality_disadvantaged-groups-almost-five-times-more-exposed-to-covid-19/45751544;"People living close to the poverty line are up to 4.5 times more exposed to the effects of Covid-19 than the rest of the population, according to a survey of people in Geneva who have turned to emergency food handouts. The surveyExternal link, carried out by the Geneva University Hospital (HUG) and Médécins sans Frontières (MSF) [Doctors Without Borders], was based on interviews with 532 people who queued for food handouts in Geneva on May 2. Of those interviewed, 75% were women and 52% did not have a valid Swiss permit. The survey reveals that the effects of the virus disproportionately affect such social groups for various reasons – mainly a difficulty in maintaining social distancing and reduced possibilities of getting treatment or a test. For example, just under half of respondents reported living in overcrowded apartments, defined as more than two people per room. Some 11% lived in housing of over four people per room. Meanwhile, only 40% had health insurance – which is obligatory in Switzerland. This number dropped to below 10% for those without a valid permit. A lack of insurance, and economic troubles generally, were mentioned by 58.6% as reasons for avoiding getting medical attention. In total, 8.8% of those interviewed had shared an apartment with somebody infected by Covid-19, but less than half of them went to get tested. Taken together, these factors “suggest significant exposure to and transmission of the virus within this population group”, according to the study authors. On the day the study was done, 1% of the total population of canton Geneva had tested positive for the coronavirus; among the survey group, this figure was 3.4%. Over 1,500 people queued up on May 9 to get free food parcels in Geneva, highlighting the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in the expensive Swiss city. A distribution for 2,500 people took place the previous Saturday and another is planned next weekend. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-11;Covid-19 brings Swiss watchmaking to a standstill;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sick-exports_covid-19-brings-swiss-watchmaking-to-a-standstill/45739818;Switzerland’s watchmaking industry has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, with the sector likely to suffer the worst crisis of its history in 2020. Nevertheless, experts are confident in the ability of the industry to recover, as it has done in the past.  For several weeks, a deathly silence has reigned over Switzerland’s watchmaking workshops. Almost all production lines have been stopped, with employees required to stay at home as they wait for better times.  “Of the 50,000 people working in businesses that are covered by collective labour agreements, 40,000 are currently on partial unemployment. Something which has never been seen in the history of Swiss watchmaking,” says Ludovic Voillat, spokesperson for the Convention of Swiss Watchmaking EmployersExternal link.  The lockdowns imposed on a large part of the world’s population, the closure of stores and the inability to travel have put the brakes on sales of “Swiss Made” watches in markets around the world. According to a report by Bank Vontobel published in early April, the sector’s exports will decline by 25% this year, more than during the quartz crisis of 1975 (down 15.2%) or during the subprime crisis of 2009 (down 22%).  “The sector’s revenue is likely to fall on average by 20% this year,” confirms Olivier Mueller, expert watchmaker at LuxeConsult. “In terms of volumes, we’re going to fall back to levels seen in 1945 with probably fewer than 16 million watches sold.”  But not everyone working in what is one of Switzerland’s prime export sectors will be affected equally. Prestige brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Omega can be expected to ride out the storm without too much damage. But the case is vastly different for several small independent brands that could be forced to close up shop over the coming months.  “Between 30 and 60 ‘Swiss Made’ watch brands – of a total 350 – will not survive,” predicts Mueller. “By my count, a dozen watchmaking companies have already filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of the crisis.”  The industry’s subcontractors are also at risk of irreversible damage. In addition to a global recession which threatens to rival that of the oil crisis of the 1970s, the sector is already suffering from significant structural problems.  The development of connected watches in recent years delivered a heavy blow to “Swiss Made” watch brands active in the entry-level segment.  “The falling volumes, which have again been accelerated by this crisis, are having an impact on the suppliers who are nevertheless one of the pillars of our industry,” Mueller says.  How many job losses?   There are also serious concerns about the preservation of jobs and watchmaking skills.  “It’s difficult to see how Swiss watchmaking will be able to come out of this crisis without major social disruption,” says Raphaël Thiemard, head of the watchmaking division for Unia, Switzerland’s largest union.  While most businesses are for the moment holding out by resorting to mass or partial unemployment, it seems that waves of redundancies by the end of the year are inevitable.  Especially since temporary workers, always the first to be laid off during difficult times, already paid the price at the end of last year due to the marked reduction in exports to Hong Kong, a leading destination market for Swiss watches.  “During the 2009 crisis, the sector lost just over 4,000 permanent jobs. We could expect to see a similar evolution with the current crisis, even if it’s difficult to make predictions, given how many uncertainties there are,” Voillat says.  Everything will depend above all on the speed with which business resumes in Asian markets. In China, some positive signs are already being seen with the gradual end to the lockdown, although a full restart of the economy is not expected until the end of summer.  That said, Bank Vontobel is betting on the industry making a strong comeback in 2021, with exports expected to rebound by around 15%. But the market could also be extremely saturated, with most brands having delayed the launch of their new models until next year.    “The Swiss industry has repeatedly proven its resilience and its ability to bounce back,” says Thiemard. “Its principal strength resides in its capacity to export its products to the entire world. We saw this during the Hong Kong crisis: when a market is in difficulty, other places pick up the slack, in this case China, Japan or even the United States.”  Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Swiss Watchmaking Industry Federation, recently sent a similar message to watchmaking businesses and associations.  “I strongly hope that our businesses will pass through this difficult period without being too affected in their substance and once again become fully operational once times are better: Swiss watchmaking will of course be present when people can again have positive emotions and the desire to treat themselves.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-11;Uncertainty reigns as schools re-open amid coronavirus pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education_uncertainty-reigns-as-schools-re-open-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/45747340; Thousands of children have returned to class on Monday, as Switzerland re-opens its compulsory schools after two months of coronavirus lockdown. But feelings - and the cantonal approaches - are mixed. “I am so happy about going back to school because I’ve had enough of distance learning,” Emile, aged 7, from Geneva, told the Le Temps newspaperExternal link ahead of his primary school re-opening its doors. “I’ve only seen one friend during lockdown, so I can’t wait to see my classmates again.” But other pupils are not so sure. “I don’t really want to go back to school. I really liked the lockdown because you can get up whenever you want and have your own timetable. I even found the schoolwork easier,” said Nina, aged ten, from Fribourg, in the same article. On May 11, all compulsory schools (with pupils up to the age of 16) are re-opening. Under Switzerland’s federal system, it’s the cantons that are in charge of educational matters – hence they have the last say in what happens. While the majority of German-speaking cantons have opted for “almost back to normal” –  allowing pupils to follow the regular school timetable – many in French-speaking SwitzerlandExternal link, and in German-speaking cantons Zurich (all more strongly affected by the coronavirus) and St Gallen (less so) have decided for a step-by-step approach. Here, classes will be divided into two, with alternating schedules, for up to four weeks, before full classes resume. The most strongly affected canton, Ticino, will use the half-class system. Schools there are also allowed a week’s delay before re-opening. + The latest on the coronavirus numbers in Switzerland All cantons are keeping to national safety requirements drawn up by the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link, which include handwashing, not sharing snacks and social distancing (although children among themselves are exempt from distancing rules), but no masks. High-risk students and teachers and those who live with high-risk family members will continue with distance learning. As can be seen in the video above, not all parents are happy with the mix of approaches. In canton Zurich, over 7,000 parents have signed a petitionExternal link calling for a full return to school, arguing that it will be a strain on parents to juggle children’s split schedules. Several French-speaking cantons have seen petitions against the re-opening altogether, citing health concerns and fears of a second wave of infections (and in Basel City, there are calls for a staggered, rather than full, return). Parents contacted by swissinfo.ch also had mixed feelings. “It seems like a huge leap to go from home-schooling to full classes in just a few days,” commented one from canton Bern, which has two days of staggered classes before going into the full timetable. Another felt getting her first-year kindergarten daughter, who had enjoyed being at home, back into the school routine might be a challenge. The re-opening of many businesses and public transport at the same time was also causing concern, because of more people moving about. Another factor causing uncertainty is the role that children play in transmitting the coronavirus. Switzerland says children do not play a big role. But a German studyExternal link has suggested adults and children carry similar viral loads. Switzerland’s National COVID-19 Science Task Force, an independent body, has meanwhile stated that the role of children and adolescents in the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 was  highly uncertain . + Here’s more on what the head of Covid-19 task force has to say on schools + Our fact check on children as drivers of the pandemic For their part, teachers are looking forward to compulsory schools re-opening and to interacting with their pupils in the classroom, Beat Schwendimann, board member of the Swiss Teachers’ Federation (LCH), told swissinfo.ch. Some adjustments will be needed. “Students will re-enter schools with different levels depending on their progress while learning from home. It will be important to teachers to support students who fell behind,” Schwendimann said in an email. + School barometer: one fifth of pupils ‘falling through the remote learning net’ Reports suggest that some students did not turn up to online lessons, had no access to computers or lacked parental support. Concerns have already been raised that any long-term distance learning could contribute to widening Switzerland’s already established educational gap. This is another reason why there has been a keenness to re-open schools. In terms of safety measures, schools are working hard to implement cantonal and national safety protocols, Schwendimann commented. The LCH would nevertheless have preferred a coordinated, nationwide approach to re-opening schools. “The LCH asks the government and health officials to closely monitor the development in schools after the reopening and adjust safety procedures as needed,” Schwendimann added. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-10;Pandemic turns Swiss into nation of bird ‘twitchers’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-pastime_pandemic-turns-swiss-into-nation-of-bird--twitchers-/45750270;Several weeks of enforced confinement at home has developed a passion for bird watching among the Swiss. Some 4,300 households took part in a week-long “Birds of our Gardens” project, initiated by BirdLife Switzerland. The conservation group challenged people to log the number of bird species in their gardens over the course of the week. Households, individuals and school classes responded with a record 140,850 sightings, BirdLife SwitzerlandExternal link reported on Sunday. The most common reported sightings were blackbirds, sparrows and great tits. But a number of other species, including the goldfinch, greenfinch and girlitz, were included among the reportsExternal link. On average, 9.5 different species were counted in every Swiss garden. That fell to 7.1 species in gardens that had fewer natural features and grew to 11.5 species in wilder spaces. The bird “twitcher” scheme was launched to promote appreciation of the array of biodiversity to be found close to home. The coronavirus lockdown presented an opportunity to recruit more people to the project as they have been spending more time at home. The results of the project “show that a small natural paradise can be created in any garden or other space in residential areas, said BirdLife Switzerland’s Raffael Ayé. “This requires native trees and shrubs, flower meadows or small structures such as piles of branches.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-10;Covid-19 will not necessarily drive up health insurance costs;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/paying-the-price_covid-19-will-not-necessarily-drive-up-health-insurance-costs/45749840;Health insurers should be able to cover the increased cost of the coronavirus pandemic without putting up premiums for customers, says the umbrella association for the sector in Switzerland. But this assumption is based on no further significant waves of infection. Switzerland’s health insurance providers have combined reserves of around CHF8 billion ($8.2 billion). This stockpile should be enough to absorb extra costs from the pandemic so far, Santésuisse director Verena Nold told the SonntagsBlick newspaperExternal link. This sum corresponds to three or four months of premiums. Nold said that insurers are more concerned with helping to cope with the pandemic than with looking after profits. The exact cost of Covid-19 to the healthcare system has yet to be worked out. Overall costs have risen 5% in the first three months of the year, compared to an average of 3-4% in the last 20 years. One of the main extra costs of the pandemic is the increase in intensive care treatment, where a two to three week stay for a single patient costs around CHF120,000. Research by the NZZ am Sonntag newspaperExternal link shows that there were 510 coronavirus patients in intensive care units (ICUs) on April 2 at the peak of the pandemic. Other ICU patients numbered 230 on this date. That position has now been reversed, with 130 coronavirus patients in ICU compared to 600 patients with other conditions. This means that there have always been several hundred spare ICU beds available in Switzerland. The total number of ICU beds was raised from 1,300 to 1,500 as the pandemic progressed. Santésuisse says insurers have adopted emergency plans to speed up the processing of claims and to conduct more consultations over video link. Nold says that one lesson to be learned is to better guarantee the supply of essential medical materials and to stock up more drugs in the country. More than 30,000 people have so far been infected by Covid-19 in Switzerland, resulting in over 1,800 deaths.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-10;Economic cost of pandemic will be enormous: SNB chief;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-impact_economic-cost-of-pandemic-will-be-enormous--snb-chief/45749620;Coronavirus is costing between CHF11 billion and CHF17 billion a month, putting such a strain on the Swiss economy that it will take years to recover. Swiss National Bank (SNB) chairman Thomas Jordan has predicted the worst depression since the 1930s. In two newspaper interviews on Sunday, Jordan warned of significant job losses and an erosion of prosperity in the wake of the pandemic. The economy is currently operating at between 70% to 80% of normal levels, he told the SonntagsZeitungExternal link. “Many people may not yet be able to imagine what these numbers mean for prosperity in Switzerland. But we will have to chew on these costs for years to come,” he said. The cost of bailing out the economy with taxpayer funding has so far hit CHF57 billion ($59 billion), but the newspaper predicts that the eventual bill could top CHF100 billion. This would rank the Swiss bailout package as among the 20 largest in the world. Government economists have predicted a slump in economic output of -6.7% this year while the unemployment rate rises. The global economic downturn has made the safe haven franc even more attractive to investors, heaping pressure on Switzerland’s central bank to stop it from appreciating too fast against other currencies. A strong franc spells even greater misery for Swiss exporters and the domestic tourism industry. The SNB has imposed negative interest rates and is continuously intervening in the foreign exchange markets to hold back the franc. But some people fear that the CHF800 billion spent on this operation could come back to haunt the central bank. “Without the [SNB’s] monetary policy, we would see a completely different franc exchange rate in the current situation,” Jordan told the Tribune de GenèveExternal link newspaper. But he was adamant that the central bank still has room to manouevre in the battle against deflation. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-10;The sound and the city: Swiss exhibit captures Kolkata’s streets;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/soundscapes-_the-sound-and-the-city--swiss-exhibit-captures-kolkata-s-streets/45746078;From barking street dogs to hustling hawkers and singing beggars, two Swiss friends have tried to record the essence of the Indian city of Kolkata. Their soundscapes and images are now on virtual exhibit through a Zurich museum.  Thomas Kaiser has a soft spot for Indian crows. A tree-lined empty lot behind his favourite Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) budget hotel attracted the vocal birds all day long.    “I would try to book a rooftop room so I could feed them,” he says.   The crows, the city and its people would keep Kaiser returning to the same Gariahat neighbourhood in Kolkata over a period of almost 15 years (1994 to 2008) to record the sounds of the area. For someone working in radio in Switzerland, the acoustical density in the eastern Indian city was like nowhere else.    The tinkling of the bells of the hand-drawn rickshaws, the soulful ballad of the Baul folk singer trying to earn a few coins and the rhythmic sales banter of street hawkers looking to make a quick sale added to rich soundscape of the city.   But despite its teeming millions, Kolkata is not always a cacophony.    “I was fascinated by the nighttime in Kolkata as it is a huge city that became very quiet after 10pm. It almost felt like an Indian village where the only sound was stray dogs barking,” he says.   Kaiser’s collection of Kolkata soundscapes is currently being exhibited at the University of Zurich’s Ethnographic Museum where he oversees the sound archives. It will be his final exhibition as he turns 65 this year and will retire in December. Covid-19 restrictions have put a dampener on his last hurrah, but a virtual exhibitionExternal link could potentially ensure his work has a much bigger audience.    While Kaiser was studying fine arts at Germany’s Düsseldorf university, he was influenced by the German artist Joseph Beuys who developed the concept of “social sculptures”. He considered society as a whole to be the malleable material of art.   “He was saying that art was not about paintings and sculptures but also interactions between people. I wanted to see if this concept would have any meaning in a non-Western context,” says Kaiser.   When friends told him about their experiences in Kolkata, he wanted to go there.    “What they told us was quite different from stories of poor people, slums and Mother Teresa that were popular at the time. They spoke of poets, writers, filmmakers and artists,” says Kaiser.    He convinced friend and photographer Samuel Schütz to join him on a trip to the sprawling Indian city. Schütz brought a range of photographic equipment with him including material needed to develop films in his hotel room. He did not know what to expect. After some experimentation he settled for the most rudimentary option: a simple shoe box that would serve as a camera obscura or pinhole camera. The photographic technique dates to the early 19th century.    “I didn't want to walk around with a camera like a tourist clicking what I thought was interesting,” says Schütz.    The shoebox camera had to be placed on the ground or on a wall which meant Schütz had to give up on the idea of being 100% in control of the image. He could only partially choose what to focus on. The box can only take one picture before the film has to be changed, which meant slowing things down.    “It enabled me to collect pictures instead of taking them,” says Schütz who is now 57.    Kaiser, on the other hand, used the best equipment possible to record high-quality audio. However, like Schütz he adopted a slow approach to capturing the essence of Kolkata.   “Sound recording requires patience and you have to revisit people until they open up and start talking,” he says. “I think this slow approach was ideal for what we were trying to capture.”   As a sound archivist, Kaiser naturally feels that sound is its own medium. He is unhappy about how it is accorded second-rung status in museums (if they even have a sound archive at all). Kaiser cites the Naga tribe in northeastern India, who wear brightly coloured ceremonial costumes, as an example of sound going forgotten.  “Museums used to collect the Naga headgear and necklaces but ignored the fact that the core of their traditional life was song as it was used to transfer knowledge. I interviewed a few master singers and they told me that a young person who couldn't sing was regarded as ignorant and would never find a spouse,” he says.    So it comes as no surprise that Kaiser’s last exhibition has sound as its central theme. The only object in the exhibition space is an effigy of the Hindu Goddess Kali, meant as an homage to the Kali temple in the centre of Kolkata’s Kalighat neighbourhood where Kaiser and Schütz worked.    According to Kaiser, the soundscape of his favourite part of Kolkata hasn’t changed much in 20 years. In this respect it is like Zurich, where he lives.    “Acoustically Zurich has not changed much over the past few years but a lot over the past few months. Now you hear birds that you didn't hear before the coronavirus restrictions,” he says from his home.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The rallies were held in defiance of police warnings not to infringe on social distancing rules. Two groups of protestors had set up in Bern on Saturday afternoon, for a second week in a row, despite a ban on more than five people gathering in public places. Some were carrying posters with slogans such as “Freedom Yes – No Constraints”. Police calls to disperse were met with boos. Police said they would not intervene because elderly people and children were among the crowds. By late afternoon the demonstration had finished. A demonstration in Basel broke up at around 3pm when police arrived on the scene. A rally of around 100 people in Zurich also dispersed peacefully with no arrests made or fines handed out. Last weekend, police broke up several demonstrations in Swiss cities, including Bern and Zurich. The protests were against the social and economic restrictions that have been in place in Switzerland since mid-March. The police action was questioned by civil rights group Amnesty International. “Even during an epidemic, a general ban on assemblies should be a measure of last resort. Measures to restrict public demonstrations should be applied proportionately. There is no reason to prohibit forms of action that do not pose a threat to public health,” the Swiss branch of the NGO stated. On Monday, some schools, shops and restaurants will be allowed to re-open, but large gatherings and many public buildings will remain closed for more weeks. There have been more than 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Switzerland and over 1,800 deaths. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-09;Swiss tourism industry struggling for survival;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_swiss-tourism-industry-struggling-for-survival/45748706;The Swiss tourism industry will take five years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic with around a quarter of companies in the sector fearing for their future. However, Martin Nydegger, head of Switzerland Tourism, believes something can still be salvaged for the industry this year. In an interview with the Schweiz am Wochenende newspaperExternal link, Nydegger referred to a survey of 4,000 companies in the tourism sector. Some 23% of respondents feared that they would not come through the pandemic crisis unscathed. It is still not known when Swiss borders will be fully opened with other countries, although June 8 has been earmarked as the start of the third phase of the plan to return the country to normality. “2020 will be a terrible year. But not everything is lost. January and February were very good months. Now we have had a quarter that was terrible. We have six months from June to save what can be saved,” Nydegger said. Towns and cities were hit worse than alpine destinations from the downturn in bookings in the last few weeks. The government has handed Switzerland Tourism CHF40 million ($41 million) to help boost the industry, which has adopted the slogan “Dream now - travel later” to convince Swiss people to take their holidays in their own country. When asked how long it will take for the industry to recover, Nydegger said: “I fear it will take five years rather than three. The cuts are so deep. In a crises, the impact is always the same: the deterioration is fast and the recovery slow.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-09;Further Swiss border crossing points to be opened;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/restrictions-eased_further-swiss-border-crossing-points-to-be-opened/45748662;Switzerland will re-open 15 more border crossing from next week as it gradually eases the lockdown restrictions on the country. Traffic has already been allowed to pass through four other crossing points, three of them on the Italian border, this week. May 11 marks the start of the second phase of a plan to restore normality to life in Switzerland. Many schools will resume teaching, shops and restaurants will be allowed to re-open, public transport will go back to normal service and restrictions on entry to the country will be eased. From Monday border crossings will be unsealed in cantons Graubünden, Ticino, Solothurn, Neuchâtel, Jura, Vaud and Valais. The majority of the crossing points connect Switzerland to France and Italy. Customs officials said the re-openings are being made in collaboration with other countries and “risk-based” controls would remain in place. At the same time, the opening times of border points that have remained open during the pandemic will be extended, the authorities said. Earlier this week, Germany said that enhanced border controls with Switzerland and other countries, introduced in March, will be extended until May 15. In an interview with the Schaffhauser Nachrichten newspaperExternal link on Saturday, Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said that the government wants to return the country to normality as quickly as possible without risking further coronavirus outbreaks. “I am convinced that in the near future we will be able to move as freely as before,” he said, when asked how soon borders will be opened with other countries.

Speaking to the Le Temps newspaperExternal link on Saturday, Nicolas Bideau, director of Presence SwitzerlandExternal link, said that the “Swiss brand” had come out of the crisis well compared to negative headlines surrounding other countries. “Coronavirus has more or less had a positive effect on the image of the country,” he told the newspaper. Bideau believes Switzerland’s reputation has been enhanced by its medical and technical innovation, political management and international cooperation in the last few weeks. In particular, Switzerland has received good marks following the response from pharmaceutical and other industries to the pandemic. Bideau pointed to Roche’s serological testing breakthrough and the development of a decentralised contact tracing app by the federal institutes of technology. Switzerland has also attracted positive headlines for the way it has handled the crisis politically, said Bideau. Cooperation with other countries has extended to Swiss hospitals treating patients from neighbouring countries, dispelling the Swiss image of insularity, he added. In addition, a number of positive anecdotal stories from Switzerland have been well received by people in other countries, Bideau said. These included Roger Federer’s tennis challenge and international press coverage of Switzerland’s forest walking trials. “These small stories may not look much but they have a big impact,” he said.

2020-05-08;Coronavirus contact tracing app: friend or foe?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus-contact-tracing-app--friend-or-foe-/45746418;"Contact tracing apps, which alert users when they have been in contact with infected people, are being touted as crucial aids to control the spread of Covid-19. But critics warn of data privacy concerns, and Switzerland’s parliament has demanded a legal basis for such an app.  Europe is slowly emerging from an artificial coma induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. As countries ease their lockdowns and try to avoid a second wave of infections, the race is on to develop smartphone apps to trace the spread of the virus. However, the tech sprint has raised numerous questions among the general population and scientific community.  The decentralised contact tracing app DP-3T, developed by the two Swiss federal institutes of technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and Lausanne (EPFL), will launch on May 13 in a pilot phase for a certain group of the population until the end of the month, Interior Minister Alain Berset said on Friday. The app, which people can voluntarily download and use, employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days – less than two metres proximity for more than 15 minutes – are alerted via the app to isolate themselves and get tested. The DP-3T system is decentralised with contacts and data stored on devices rather than on an external server. On Tuesday, the Swiss House of Representatives approved a proposalExternal link that urges the government to prepare a bill to ensure the app is defined under Swiss law. The Senate had agreed a similar proposal earlier. During this week’s debate, critics argued that it was important to set clear rules for the use of such a tracking device, including data security and the voluntary principle for participants. “We must avoid, for example, that businesses or institutions demand the use of the application from their customers or visitors,” argued centre-right Radical parliamentarian Damien Cottier. Opponents say a specific law is not necessary as current regulations are enough under the law on communicable diseases in force since 2016.  Berset told reporters on May 8 that the government would submit a draft bill to parliament by May 20, which will be discussed in the June session. The May test phase will go ahead, as no specific legal basis is necessary for trials. Berset urgent parliament to quickly resolve the matter but acknowledged that if parliament says no to the legal basis] it will be finished for the app .  Who will download it Researchers frequently cite a participation rate of 60% by the population to ensure the contact tracing is efficient. “It is all the more important to establish a solid foundation on which to build public confidence,” added Cottier. But some epidemiologists believe that a 20-30% usage rate would already help to control the spread of infections. Over the past few months the Swiss authorities have pushed ahead with the development of the DP-3T app “as fast as possible” while insisting on its safety. “The individual’s doctor and the cantonal contact tracing centre will be the only ones to know the identity of the infected person. In addition, only they can authorise an infected person to report the infection to the system anonymously, by transmitting an authorisation code,” the government states in its position paper.  Solange Ghernaouti, a professor at the University of Lausanne and cybersecurity expert, is among the sceptics. She welcomes parliament's decision to create a legal basis to put safeguards against misuse . “The drafting of a law will make it possible to have a public debate on the role of digital technology in finding solutions to concrete problems, she said. But Ghernaouti warns that a legal basis is not necessarily the solution to all problems. “There's no guarantee that the system won't be hacked. What’s more, there will be some people trying to do just that, because we know that health-related data is worth its weight in gold,” she said. Breaking anonymity requires certain specialist hacking skills, explained the professor. But she is certain that anyone who tries will be successful by cross-checking information. And arguing that it is Swiss made system is not a guarantee of security either, warned Ghernauouti.  “No single country has found the miracle app or proven its effectiveness. Under these conditions, it would be better not to use it,” she said.  Aside from the security problems, the Lausanne professor is worried by the speed with which the tracing system has been created.  “There won’t be enough time for it to be tested and validated properly, but a huge amount of trust has been put in it. Insufficient time seems to have been set aside to create something good.” The risk, she added, is that if we accept such surveillance systems during crises, it might not be possible to uninstall them later.  “Do we want to help epidemiologists control pandemics? Of course, but not at any price,” said Ghernaouti. Her concerns have been shared by other scientists, even at the EPFL. For several weeks, the EPFL researchers involved in the project have been working 15-hour days to finalise the app.  “Technically, we are almost there. We’ll be ready to launch the application when the authorities decide to do so,” said EPFL spokesperson Emmanuel Barraud. While acknowledging the security concerns, Barraud reassures that “the application is designed to guarantee anonymity… Everything happens on the users' phones, not on a central server, which could be the target of a hacking attempt.” Even if a someone manages to get into the system, they would only find encrypted information, said Barraud. “They'd get a list of codes that can't be traced back to anyone. This is the only information that circulates between two phones, he explained.  Despite this, some researchers working on the project say the high expectations should be downplayed. “The Bluetooth technology isn't perfect; it's going to miss some people. And just because you're alerted to the fact that you've been in contact with an infected person doesn't mean that it's that person who infected you,” Carmela Troncoso, a computer scientist at Lausanne who has been involved in designing and coding DP-3T, recently told the weekly Illustré magazine.  She insists that the app must be seen as a complement to manual contact tracing .

The two chambers held their four-day session, which finished on Thursday, in a congress building on the outskirts of the capital Bern. This was because the regular parliament building in the city centre did not allow enough space for social distancing.  + Parliament resumes its role as political watchdog   On the agenda was emergency funding and the government’s decisions over the coronavirus crisis.   Parliament on Tuesday approved a financial package of more than CHF57 billion to help businesses and institutions cope with the impact of the pandemic in Switzerland.  Discussion became especially animated when it came to the proposed bailout of almost CHF2 billion for the aviation sector. Left-wing parties tried to link aid to environmental standards, but their demands were rejected.   Parliamentarians added CHF170 million in emergency relief for hard-hit sectors that had been “forgotten” by the government.  This included CHF65 million for daycare facilities, CHF65 million for the media and CHF40 million for tourism.  + Swiss tourism numbers crash as jobless figures rise  Parliament also decided that a tracking device to stem the spread of coronavirus in Switzerland should be defined in a law – against the will of the government.   + Legal basis demanded for coronavirus tracing app  Other decisions that were influenced by parliament – also through the work of committees and the presidents of the two parliamentary houses – include the allocation of loss of income allowances to all independent businesses, whether directly or indirectly affected by the country’s coronavirus pandemic measures.  Parliamentarians had also called for extra funding for the international humanitarian aid effort to support the poorest countries in their fight against the pandemic and for the global efforts against Covid-19. The government reacted by earmarking CHF400 million for international aid.  Half of that amount would be granted as an interest-free loan to the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for work it is carrying out in over 80 countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) would receive a loan of CHF25 million for its disaster fund.    + Read more about this story here  Parliamentary committees will continue their work so that they can intervene quickly concerning government decisions and to prepare for June’s parliamentary session, which will also take place in Bern. On the agenda then will be issues arising from the coronavirus crisis but also “normal” parliamentary business that had to be postponed.   The big issues currently suspended: the revision of the CO2 law, the responsible business initiative and same-sex marriage.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

First white rhino born in Zurich Zoo;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/baby-girl_first-white-rhino-born-in-zurich-zoo/45746116;A white rhinoceros has been born for the first time in Zurich Zoo. Visitors can see the baby girl from June 8, when zoos re-open.  Mother Tanda, 27, and baby are doing well, Zurich Zoo said on FridayExternal link. Tanda is already breastfeeding her baby, who was born on Thursday and as yet doesn’t have a name. The latest zoo resident is the seventh baby for Tanda, who arrived – pregnant – at Zurich Zoo in December from an Israeli zoo, accompanied by two of her daughters and a young male. The gestation period lasted 487 days (16 months).  The white rhinos of Zurich Zoo live in the large new Lewa SavannahExternal link, which they share with giraffes, zebras, antelopes and ostriches. The area was inaugurated in the absence of the public due to the coronavirus crisis.  Not everyone is happy about how zoos have been treated during the pandemic. Industry umbrella association ZooschweizExternal link said on Thursday it was “incomprehensible” that museums could re-open from May 11 but not zoos and animal parks. This was “unequal treatment” which was “unacceptable”, it said.  Zoo visitors are mainly outside where the risk of infection is lower than in closed rooms in museums, it argued.  Although Swiss zoos are closed for the time being, that hasn’t stopped children at home from learning how the animals live and behave behind closed gates:  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Just last year, the fintech firm said it was worth CHF1 billion having attracted big ticket investments from around the world. The digital finance platform employs around 150 staff at its headquarters in Zurich. Operating mainly in the German market, Numbrs had raised $200 million (CHF195 million) in previous funding rounds despite failing to make an annual profit since its inception in 2014. But the company now faces a painful restructuring period because “a new round of financing in the high double-digit million range has not materialized despite a legally binding signature”. The company did not name the proposed investors or say whether they had pulled out due to the economic uncertainties created by coronavirus. As a result of the blow, Numbrs says it must now reduce fixed costs, such as staff wages, by 50%. But the company is going ahead with plans to enter the British market. “I would like to ask all Numbrs employees for understanding that, like many other startups, we now have to prepare for a longer dry spell,” stated managing partner Fynn Kreuz. The coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted venture capital funding as the economy and financial markets have been thrown into turmoil. Several investors have seen their own wealth shrink and are concentrating on keeping their current portfolio of start-ups afloat rather than risking new investments.

2020-05-08;The Swiss need three planets – in theory;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-earth-overshoot-day/45745704;To highlight how quickly humans are depleting Earth, environmental activists predict when countries will have used up their annual share of natural resources. For Switzerland, that day is May 8 this year, again far ahead of the global average. The overall Earth Overshoot Day, as calculated by the Global Footprint NetworkExternal link, is expected to fall at the end of July or early August. In the 1970s, it came in November or December. “Due to its comparatively high consumption level, Switzerland is one of the countries with disproportionately high environmental footprints per capita,” wrote Karine Siegwart, deputy director of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, in a recent studyExternal link. More than half of commuters in Switzerland drive to work rather than taking public transportation, cycling or walking. The average Swiss flies about 9,000km per year, twice as much as 20 years ago. Indoors, Switzerland uses more heating oil than other European countries and is above average when it comes to heat loss due to poor insulation of buildings. Per capita, Swiss residents throw away more rubbish than most other Europeans. “Many Swiss people have the impression that we are especially environmentally friendly,” said Thomas Vellacott, managing director of WWF SwitzerlandExternal link. “Unfortunately, the opposite is true.” The consequences will be costly, he warned. “Today and in the longer term, this causes ever greater financial, social and ecological costs that must be borne by the general public.” According to the Global Footprint Network, Switzerland ranks 41st on the list of national overshoot days. Qatar ranks first, (February 11), Luxembourg (February 16) second and United Arab Emirates (March 7) third. Also ahead of Switzerland are the United States (March 14), Canada (March 18), Austria (April 8), Singapore (April 11), Russia (April 25) and Germany (May 3). However, other major developing and developed countries are behind Switzerland: This includes Japan (May 12), France and Italy (May 14), Britain (May 16), Portugal (May 25), Spain (May 27) and China (June 13). At the far end of the spectrum are Cuba (December 1), Morocco (December 16) and Kyrgyzstan (December 26). In 2018 and 2019, Swiss Overshoot Day fell on May 7. Prior to that, it was April 27 (2017), March 22 (2016) and April 13 (2015). “Sometimes the Swiss Overshoot Day is a few days earlier, sometimes a few days later. This year it has to do with the fact that we have a leap year,” WWF Switzerland spokeswoman Corina Gyssler said. She also noted that fluctuations could result from improved data or calculation updates. While Switzerland’s Overshoot Day has been relatively stable, the global day has gradually been edging closer. It will announce the date of Earth Overshoot Day 2020 early next month. This year’s dates for individual countries are based on data from last year, and do not take the coronavirus pandemic into account, its authors say. “It is still too early to tell as data on these significant changes are limited,” notes Global Footprint Network on its website.

2020-05-08;Schools re-opening hit by lack of teachers ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education-_schools-re-opening-hit-by-lack-of-teachers-/45745842;Up to 15% of teachers won’t be able to work in canton Zurich on Monday when compulsory schools re-open, the canton’s head of education says. They are either in the risk group or live with someone in the risk group.  This is a rough estimate, Silvia Steiner told the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper on FridayExternal link. Replacements will be found among student teachers. She said she was convinced that schools would find a good solution by Monday, but she said she was aware that not everything could be sorted out in the last minute.  It was a similar situation in other cantons like both Basels, with some expecting up to 20% fewer teachers, the newspaper reported.   The head of the Swiss Teachers’ Federation Dagmar Rösler also reckons there will be a 15% gap.   On May 11, all compulsory schools (with pupils up to the age of 16) are re-opening. Under Switzerland’s federal system, it’s the cantons that are in charge of educational matters – hence they have the last say in what happens.   While the majority of German-speaking cantons have opted for “almost back to normal”–  allowing pupils to follow the regular school timetable, others, especially in French-speaking SwitzerlandExternal link, have chosen a more softly, softly approach.  + No unified plan for re-opening schools   Zurich, an economic powerhouse, has been more strongly affected by the coronavirus than some other German-speaking cantons. It has therefore opted for the softly approach, with classes that are divided into two, with alternating schedules. This will last for four weeks before a more regular school timetable is expected to resume.  Teachers and parents have raised concerns ahead of the re-opening of schools. The government has however set down a national health protocol for all schools – even if it has left the practicalities to the cantons – which include social distancing for adults and between adults and children (children between themselves are exempt as this is deemed unrealistic), extra cleaning and no sharing of snacks. There is no obligation to wear masks. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-08;Bitcoin Suisse targets dual bank licences with fund raise;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/growth-plans_bitcoin-suisse-targets-liechtenstein-bank-license-with-fund-raise/45745176;Bitcoin Suisse is looking to attract nearly CHF50 million ($51.4 million) from investors to fund growth ambitions, which include offering banking services in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The funding round will be a litmus test of investor risk appetite for blockchain-based finance during the coronavirus pandemic. Some CHF20 million has already been collected in an initial funding round, led by Swiss banker Roger Studer and the Studer Family Office. Bitcoin Suisse, which is valued at CHF275 million, has now thrown the funding open to other investors until mid-June, offering up to 20% of group shares. The company, founded in 2013 in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley, announced last year that it is seeking banking and securities dealer’s licences in Switzerland. It is now approaching investors for at least CHF46 million, to boost its capital base to CHF100 million, in order to pursue expansion plans. It is telling investors that it could reach “unicorn” status (a valuation of CHF1 billion) by 2025. Included in its expansion wish list is a desire to convert its Liechtenstein operations into a fully operational bank. This would give it access to European Union banking clients. The firm has earmarked further funds to beef up proprietary trading, its credit business and for future acquisitions. It plans to follow-up its investor funding round this year with a security token offering (STO) - selling digital representations of shares to the public - in 2021 and a stock exchange listing the year after. Bitcoin Suisse founder and chairman Niklas Nikolajsen said that his “life’s work” has “come a long way”. He added: “But looking forward, we could face limitations as to the speed of our growth.” The fresh injection of capital would help the company “continue our exponential growth, as well as expand with cross border licences.” The funding round coincides with the pandemic that has plunged the financial, capital and cryptocurrency markets into turmoil. Many investors have taken a hit on their cash stockpiles and are wary of taking on more risk. The trump card for Bitcoin Suisse is presenting an established business with 145 staff, around CHF1 billion of crypto assets in custody and products such a Swiss franc-backed “stablecoin” bond and a cryptocurrency retail payments project together with Worldline. Last year revenues topped CHF20 million, but this is half the turnover recorded in 2017 at the peak of bitcoin’s value. The company said business had picked up since the last quarter of 2019, hitting record levels last month. Profits of around CHF2.4 million in 2019 were also well down on the past two years, eroded by a significant growth in staff, costs of applying for a Swiss banking licence and acquisitions. Despite the current economic turmoil, there are signs of investors putting their money into Swiss digital assets enterprises. Crypto Finance raised CHF14 million and financial services firm Taurus an “eight digit” sum in recent weeks. Digital assets banks Sygnum and SEBA, who were awarded Swiss banking licences last year, were able to raise higher sums in the last couple of years. SEBA accumulated CHF100 million in 2018 while Sygnum has accrued CHF60 million, plus a further “substantial” sum injected by partners into a collaborative digital asset trading venture. In November, SEBA said it wanted to raise at least CHF100 million in the first half of this year by issuing digital tokens to the public. Fund-raising plans have been put back to later in the year due to the volatile markets and dampening of investor risk appetite. Sygnum is also seeking an unspecified amount of fresh funding from existing investors this year to pay for its own expansion plans. Nikolajsen acknowledges that coronavirus has created market disruptions and uncertainty, but in a recent messageExternal link said he saw “more promise than peril, more opportunity than misfortune” for new technologies in the crisis.

2020-05-07;Swiss fear coronavirus curbs intrude on personal rights;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-monitor_swiss-fear-coronavirus-curbs-intrude-on-personal-rights/45742998;Concerns about loss of personal freedoms appear to be growing in Switzerland following weeks of restrictions on public life aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic. An opinion poll published on Thursday also found attitude towards the crisis have generally become more similar among the country’s three main language regions. “There is a striking unease about a possible loss of personal freedoms in the long-term,” says Michael Hermann, head of the Sotomo research instituteExternal link which carried out the survey. A growing number of respondents are concerned because they believe restrictions might stay in place for at least another 12 months, he says. This latest survey stands in contrast to a much more optimistic assessment in April when nearly 30% of those surveyed were hopeful the lockdown measures would all be lifted in early summer.  Fears of a negative impact of the pandemic on the Swiss economy remain high, while concerns about suffering from virus-related health problems have moved down the list. The survey – the third of its kind since March, when the government ordered sweeping measures restricting public life and the economy – found that people have coped well with the lockdown.  “One factor is undoubtedly that there was no general curfew. Unlike residents in other countries, people in Switzerland could still leave their homes and they did so as the survey shows,” Hermann says.  There may be some truth to the saying that the Covid-19 pandemic is the Great Depression in the United States, while it feels more like great holidays in Switzerland, he quipped.  Hermann also pointed out that the full force of the crisis has yet to hit, as most people in Switzerland, regardless of the language region, are not yet fully aware of the economic impact. So far, many have benefited from the unemployment scheme and Switzerland’s social security system. Most respondents said they agreed with the government’s staggered policy of easing the lockdown. The second phase comes into force next Monday with the re-opening of all shops, schools resuming classes and public transport going back to regular service. However, borders remain closed and mass events are banned until at least the end of August, dampening hopes of a long holiday abroad or of music and sport events with crowd attendance. Responses differ among the country’s three main language regions, but Hermann says that overall the differences have narrowed, especially between the majority German-speaking and the French-speaking parts.  But the Italian-speaking region, which borders northern Italy – a hotspot for the pandemic in Europe – is clearly more in favour of restrictions and a slower lifting of the curbs.  The wearing of protective masks for shoppers, the re-opening of obligatory schools as well as restaurants and bars are just three potential areas of conflict, highlighting the federalist structure of Switzerland. The system gives each of its 26 cantons a large degree of autonomy, notably on health and education matters.  Virtually unchanged is people’s high trust in the government, as the graphic below shows. Compared with previous Covid-19 surveys, the French-speaking region has become slightly less critical of the official policy.  However, a slim majority of respondents agree that the government should keep its extra powers during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the right to impose emergency measures without giving parliament – or the people – a say.  This might come as a surprise amid Switzerland’s political system, often portrayed as a model of direct democracy.

2020-05-07;Swiss companies free to pay dividends despite bailouts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-economy_swiss-companies-free-to-pay-dividends-despite-bailouts/45743862;Swiss companies that receive state bailouts during the coronavirus pandemic will still be allowed to pay dividends to shareholders. A divided parliament eventually rejected calls to ban the billions that are expected to be paid out by firms this year. During a hotly debated session on Thursday, the House of Representatives initially backed a proposal to prevent companies issuing dividends if they receive taxpayer money to cope with the pandemic. But the Senate later killed the proposal by decisively rejecting the measure. Switzerland is expected to foot a bill of around CHF6 billion ($6.2 billion) to subsidise the wages of workers who have been put on reduced hours during the Covid-19 crisis. The number of companies and workers that have applied for this insurance far outstrips any other economic crisis. “Companies will benefit from this money, so it is justifiable that they will not pay dividends in return,” said left-wing Social Democrat party politician Mattea Meyer. Meeting for the first time since a pandemic-enforced suspension, parliamentarians fiercely debated whether companies should be allowed to continue paying out dividends. Some said it was pointless seeing firms dishing out billions of francs while receiving state aid at the same time. But the majority in the Senate argued that it made no sense to interfere with corporate policies. Large banks UBS and Credit Suisse have postponed half of their dividend payments until the autumn. But companies such as Swatch, cement manufacturer Lafarge-Holcim and automotive supplier Georg Fischer are planning to pay at least partial dividends. “Swatch Group has contributed several hundred million Swiss francs to this [short-time working] insurance over the past 20 years and uses it only in extremely rare cases,” stated Swatch. “It would be counterproductive to force companies to choose between short-time work and paying dividends,” said Economics Minister Guy Parmelin. “And it would create more uncertainty in this time of crisis.” All parties agreed that the short-time work insurance has prevented more job losses. The unemployment rate in April climbed to 3.3% in April, up from 2.9% in March. “In the current crisis, where 20 times as many companies have resorted to short-time work, it can be assumed that the unemployment rate would have reached 10% without this tool,” said Michael Siegenthaler from the KOF Swiss Economic Institute. The same debate over dividends is being played out in other countries. The European Union wants to attach conditions for companies that receive taxpayer bailouts. Germany has banned firms from paying dividends if they get their cash from a state-owned bank. However, other German firms say they will continue with dividends having obtained funds from other sources. Banks across Europe have agreed to suspend or terminate dividend payments under pressure from home governments or central banks. But in many cases, Switzerland included, it has been left to companies to decide whether it makes economic sense to fulfil the demands of shareholders or whether to hold on to funds to help see them through the crisis.

2020-05-07;Swiss tourism numbers crash as jobless figures rise;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-economy_swiss-tourism-numbers-crash-as-jobless-figures-rise/45743354;The number of overnight stays in Swiss hotels fell by nearly two-thirds in March as the coronavirus pandemic gripped the country. Hotels recorded just 1.26 million overnight stays compared to 3.4 million in the same month last year. The dramatic downturn was expected due to the government-imposed lockdown and border restrictions. The figures, released on Thursday, show that Swiss residents had also shunned hotels in their own country, having been urged to stay at home during the usually busy Easter weekend. The number of foreign tourists staying at Swiss hotels during March plummeted 68% while domestic trade fell 56%, according to official statistics. Hotels have been open but have had to apply social distancing measures and close restaurant facilities to non-guests. The situation is set to improve for the hospitality industry with the lockdown being gradually eased throughout May and June. But officials have warned the tourism industry to expect tough conditions to continue for the much of the year. According to a survey of hotel owners by the Haute Ecole du Valais, 57% of establishments in the country have since closed and 21% have partially closed. The survey also found bookings fell by 69% in March, 90% in April and 73% in May. Hotel owners surveyed estimate their risk of bankruptcy to be about 23%. Also as expected, the number people registered as unemployed has been rising. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) said on Thursday that April jobless figures had risen nearly 18,000 from the previous month. There were 43% more people registered as jobless last month compared to April last year. The overall rate of unemployment rose to 3.3% last month, up from 2.9% in March. The cost in welfare payments and subsidies for employees on shortened working hours is expected to hit CHF20 billion this year, up from the usual CHF6-7 billion unemployment bill in Switzerland.

The restaurant must keep this data for 14 days and then delete it fully.   This measure is to help anti-coronavirus contact tracing according to the plan drawn up in consultation with the Federal Office of Public Health and the Federal Food Safety Office, but some fear it is too intrusive. For example, Gille Meystre, head of the restaurant sector association in canton Vaud told Swiss television RTS on Tuesday that it was a “big negative point”.    A spokeswoman for the Federal Data Protection CommissionerExternal link told the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper that it was not the task of private catering establishments to check the accuracy of the information provided, or to trace infected persons. For this reason, the collection of names and telephone numbers as a measure to combat epidemics should in principle only be carried out on a voluntary basis,  she said.  Standing in bars and restaurants will not be allowed when they re-open on Monday. Establishments must make hand cleansing with soap and water or disinfectant available to customers as they enter.   They must also ensure that their staff are exposed “as little as possible” by taking appropriate protection measures, limiting the duration of contact with clients or putting other types of service in place, according to the sector rules. The wearing of masks for staff is recommended but not compulsory.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-06;Legal basis demanded for coronavirus tracing app;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/parliament_legal-basis-demanded-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/45739970;Parliament wants the use of a tracking device to stem the spread of coronavirus in Switzerland to be defined in a law. The mobile phone app to be will be launched on a trial basis in the next few days. The House of Representatives approved a proposal on Tuesday calling on the government to prepare a bill to be discussed at a later stage. The Senate had agreed a similar proposal on the first day of an extraordinary session of parliament to discuss government measures to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the debate, proponents argued that it is key to set clear rules for the use of such a tracking device, including data security and the voluntary principle for participants. Opponents, including the government, argue a specific law is not necessary as current regulations are sufficient under the law on communicable diseases in force since 2016. Scientists at the Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and in Lausanne are developing a mobile phone application to be ready for use next week. Parliament’s decision is unlikely to stop the launch of the app as no specific legal basis is necessary for trials. However, experts say it takes at least 60% of the population to participate in the test phase to make the contact tracing efficient. The health authorities plan to resume the tracking of patients infected with the Covid-19 virus next week. The mobile phone application is one of several methods used to protect the population from virus. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-06;Parliament approves funds to keep vital Swiss air links open;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-and-airlines_parliament-pays-up-to-keep-vital-swiss-air-links-open/45740514;Having lost its national airline, Switzerland is determined not to be deprived of international air connections as well. Parliament has approved a credit of CHF1.875 billion ($1.92 billion) to support SWISS and other aviation companies that ensure vital transport infrastructure for the Swiss economy.  Since Swissair was grounded in 2001, the civil aviation sector has been in foreign hands. Air transport is mainly provided by German airline SWISS – founded in 2002 from the ashes of Swissair and sold to Lufthansa three years later – and British airline easyJet. Airport and technical services are managed by Swissport and SR Technics, whose parent company is China’s HNA. Catering is provided by Gategroup, controlled by the Asian fund RRJ Group.  Should the government help these foreign companies overcome the crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic to maintain an efficient air transport infrastructure in Switzerland?  “Yes,” said parliament, in the absence of alternatives – and by a large majority. Last week it approved the government’s request for loans totalling CHF1.875 billionExternal link: CHF1.275 billion to guarantee loans to airlines operating in Switzerland and CHF600 million to support aviation companies at national airports.  “The aviation sector is of systemic importance to Switzerland. The aviation industry generates around 5% of GDP, which is equivalent to the value of the banking sector,” Finance Minister Ueli Maurer pointed out during the debate.   Around 40% of exports and 20% of imports are transported by air. In addition, more than half of all foreign tourists fly to Switzerland.  A diversified economy like Switzerland’s needed international and intercontinental connections, Maurer stressed, adding that it was not essential for SWISS to provide the connections, but it was essential to have them.  Without SWISS and the network offered by Lufthansa, Switzerland would have four or five intercontinental connections, whereas today there are 20 to 30, he said.  After Swissair’s grounding, passenger traffic in Switzerland fell sharply, but in the past 15 years, since SWISS was taken over by Lufthansa, the number has practically doubled. In 2019 SWISS transported 19 million passengers to 45 countries. Freight traffic, provided by the Swiss WorldCargo division, covered 130 destinations in 80 countries.

2020-05-06;SNB’s swollen balance-sheet poses risk to ‘credibility’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/monetary-policy_snb-s-swollen-balance-sheet-poses-risk-to--credibility-/45740088;When the Swiss National Bank (SNB) followed last year’s $50 billion (CHF48.6 billion) profit with a record $39 billion first-quarter loss, it was a stark illustration of the volatility created by a decade of unconventional monetary policy. The SNB’s balance sheet has ballooned over the past decade as the bank has snapped up other currencies in an attempt to hold down the franc. The SNB believes an overvalued currency, driven up by panicked investors seeking a haven for their cash, would create deflation and spell disaster for Swiss exporters. But some see the foreign-currency investments – which, at almost CHF800 billion ($811 billion), exceed those of sovereign wealth funds of oil-rich states such as Abu Dhabi and Qatar – as an increasing threat. “You do not want the SNB to become like a hedge fund, that has become so big relative to the size of the Swiss economy that if it does something wrong it could ruin the country,” said Stéphane Monier, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier, a private bank. “Can they push it to the absurd?” The SNB declined to comment for this article. At a news conference in March, its governor Thomas Jordan said simply that the central bank “is helping to stabilise the economic situation” through its “expansionary” monetary policy. “We must counteract increased upward pressure on the Swiss franc,” he added. “We have therefore decided to scale up our foreign-exchange market interventions, a tried-and-tested instrument, to shield the Swiss economy.” The SNB has long used currency interventions alongside the lowest interest rates in the world, minus 0.75%, as its main tools to control the franc. Interventions have not always been well received. In January, the US threatened to label Switzerland as a currency manipulator, warning that actions in currency markets equivalent to more than 2% of gross domestic product in any given year would trigger such a designation. But coronavirus has changed the political calculation. Maxime Botteron, an economist at Credit Suisse, estimates the SNB’s first-quarter purchases amounted to more than 5.6% of GDP. Professor Michael Graff, head of macroeconomic forecasting at the Swiss Economic Institute, observed that once the franc had strengthened from CHF1.085 against the euro at the beginning of the year to CHF1.05 in mid-April, “it stayed there”. He added: “The SNB is going to keep on buying FX as much as is necessary to keep the Swiss franc in the comfort zone.” The SNB should be careful not to lose its “credibility” with the markets, he said, noting that the balance sheet “has already exploded extremely, to put it bluntly”. What distinguishes the SNB’s balance sheet from most other central banks is that much of its investment has been poured into equities, rather than government bonds. At one point in 2018, the central bank owned more of Facebook’s standard shares than Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive and co-founder. For the bank’s leadership, the resulting swings in income, the first-quarter loss was the biggest since the SNB’s foundation in 1906, are just a matter of accounting. The bank prioritises liquidity above all else. It invests passively by replicating stock market indices, although it does not invest in other banks, or controversial companies such as arms manufacturers. But keeping politics out of its experiment may be an increasingly difficult task, now that its pool of assets is equivalent to about 120% of Switzerland’s economic output. The country’s corporatist political culture means the cantons, as well as federal politicians in Bern, have a stake – and a voice – in how the SNB conducts its affairs. “The SNB is one of the sacred cows of Switzerland,” Graff said. “You don’t criticise the SNB.” That may not last. Several quarters of losses for the SNB, which, unusually for a central bank, is listed on the Swiss stock exchange, would mean halting distributions to the cantons under a profit-share agreement. Some foresee a bigger danger: that the SNB could lose control of its policy for the franc, if circumstances dramatically alter and it needs to repatriate its holdings, throwing the exchange-rate effect into reverse. “I think it will be difficult for the SNB to keep leaning against the wind,” said Monier. “Its balance sheet could become excessively large. A $39 billion loss in a quarter is not small. What happens when it gets to $100 billion?” In 2015, the SNB’s credibility took a knock when it dramatically abandoned its peg for the franc against the euro, causing a rapid appreciation that became known as the “frankenshock”. The SNB has since avoided giving firm guidance on where it believes the currency should be, keeping speculators guessing. That may give it more flexibility in the months ahead. “The Swiss economy has adapted itself over the past 20, 30 years to the constant appreciation of the franc,” UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti told the Financial Times. What is important, Ermotti argues, is volatility in the franc “and how quickly it appreciates”.

2020-05-05;I have the mountains to myself this summer;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/letter-from-the-alps_i-have-the-mountains-to-myself-this-summer/45735968;I would like to share them with you, but you may have to wait a while. The Swiss tourist industry received a bit of good news last week when the government announced that restaurants could re-open from mid-May, and, if coronavirus infection rates remain low, other tourist infrastructure could resume operations in June.   But, with borders still closed, the very English mountain resort of Wengen and its hotels with names like Victoria and Regina will be, well, a lot less English. The high street of Interlaken will be void of visitors from the Gulf States, India and China, so the strip’s luxury watch shops will be largely void of customers. And the cosmopolitan resort of St Moritz with its distinctly Italian flair will be distinctly less Italian. Welcome to the new normal of tourism. As Europe slowly emerges from its self-imposed house arrest (some countries stricter than others), citizens will resume their summer vacation planning, taking advantage of their regained, albeit limited, freedom of movement.  The optimists will see an opportunity to explore sights closer to home, and if the places are world famous – be they cities, mountains or seashores – without the usual tourist hordes.  Environmentalists have welcomed the improvements to the climate and, here in the Alps, greeted the respite given to mountain wildlife when the ski season ended a month early.  On the other hand, the glass will be half empty for those who in the past took every opportunity to travel abroad. There were certainly a lot of us, about 1.5 billion last year, according to the World Tourism Organization.  Clearly, global travellers and everyone whose livelihood depends on tourism are peering into a half-empty glass. Combined with domestic travel, tourism was valued at $1.5 trillion (CHF1.45 trillion) last year, or 30% of the world’s exports of services.  The industry became so big that a new word entered our vocabulary to describe the strain placed on must-see sights: “overtourism”.​ ​ I wonder what the coronavirus-induced coll​apse, at least in the short term, will mean particularly for the travel industry in the Swiss Alps. ​ The buzzword “staycation” could make us forget “overtourism”, but that could be a bad omen for places that have depended on large groups from abroad such as Interlaken, Lucerne and Zermatt. Last year, foreign visitors accounted for about two-thirds of all nights spent in the hotels in Interlaken and the surrounding mountain resorts.  The Swiss government has appealed to the population to support local tourism by holidaying at home this summer – as if we had a choice. Even so, there are simply not enough of us to fill all the hotels and restaurants, nor can we be expected to see and do the same things.  In a recent article in my local newspaper, a tourism expert, ​​Monika Bandi from the University of Bern, described the Swiss “staycation” approach: People will make a lot of day trips, going for walks in the mountains or spending a few hours lazing lakeside, she said. It’s also likely that Swiss hikers, when they do venture further from home, will spend time in less touristy parts of the Alps that they’ve always wanted to see but never got round to visiting, contributing like never before to the local economies.   But there’s a catch. While restaurants can re-open to offer limited seating in respect of social distancing guidelines, there’s been no word yet when other tourist infrastructure can start up again. Thousands of cable cars, gondolas and chairlifts are strung across the Swiss Alps, transporting hikers in summer and skiers in winter, making the Alps accessible for all​. If they don’t go back into operation, a mountain holiday becomes a lot less attractive.  Among the people waiting for a decision from the government with bated breath are the wardens of mountain huts, who serve up simple but hearty meals to day-trippers and offer half-board lodging for hikers and climbers. Later this week, we will profile a few of the huts to give you an impression of the challenges of living and working at altitude.   If you’ve ever spent time at a Swiss alpine refuge, what was your experience like? More importantly, do you plan on coming back if the new normal ever reverts to the old normal?

2020-05-05;What does business look like in a post-lockdown world?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eye-on-the-multinationals_what-does-business-look-like-in-a-post-lockdown-world-/45737734; Switzerland is easing up on the lockdown but what the new normal looks like for big companies is still a work in progress. Last week, the Swiss government announced it was taking its foot off the brakesExternal link and re-opening the economy on the condition that we all behave ourselves. But the good behaviour rules for hair salons – one of the first sectors to re-open its doors – can’t exactly be copy-pasted into a code of conduct for big multinational companies like Nestlé and LafargeHolcim. While the government has guidelinesExternal link, there is plenty of uncharted territory. Should you require suppliers to distribute masks? Who is going to police the coffee breaks? Do you track the movements of infected employees? Do you mandate testing of factory workers? And what happens if someone is infected? Some companies like Novartis are releasing their own guidanceExternal link for business partners operating during the pandemic. Nestlé is providing free mealsExternal link and transport for employees in factories and distribution centres to help reduce the risk they fall ill. But all of the legal grey areas can create trouble. A couple of weeks ago the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported that the managing director of Glencore’s mining subsidiary in Zambia was detained leaving the countryExternal link, which the company told the paper was in response to the company’s decision to temporarily stop operating because of the coronavirus crisis. (The company has just announced it has restarted operationsExternal link for 90 days.) They aren’t the only ones that have had to halt operations. Trafigura’s mine operator Chemaf in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had to dial back, impacting a promising project with informal miners that helped eliminate child labour on the site. Children may indeed be one of the tragic casualties of the crisis as experts warn that the pandemic could lead to a spike in child labourExternal link in West Africa, where nearly 70% of the world’s cocoa is produced, as schools close and monitors stay away. Luxury watchmakers in Switzerland are also taking a beating. Just as the luxury watch industry was poking its head out after the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, it saw exports drop more than 20% in March. But, as the New York Times points out, what lies ahead could be even more perilousExternal link as consumers may think twice about a luxury watch when they are busy stockpiling toilet paper.    But it’s the small players that are struggling the most. This is true in watchmaking but also in another of Switzerland’s prized sectors: biotech. While several biotech companies are working on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, others are on the brink as clinical trials stall, crippling financing prospects. Some 70% of biotechs in Switzerland are too small to be a start-up yet too big to make money, virtually shutting them out of federal emergency loans. Switzerland is emerging as a big fish in the fight against Covid-19. Over the weekend, Roche’s new antibody test received emergency approval in the US. Swiss drugmaker Lonza also signed a big deal with Moderna to be the manufacturing muscleExternal link behind its potential vaccine. The big lingering question is not only which one will make it to the end but also who is first in line to receive itExternal link.  Got a tip or a story idea?

2020-05-05;Swiss parliament extends coronavirus relief package;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sign-off-session_swiss-parliament-extends-coronavirus-relief-package/45737938;Parliament has approved a financial package of more than CHF57 billion ($59.1 billion) to help businesses and institutions cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland. The Senate gave the green light on Tuesday for loan guarantees to small and medium-sized companies (CHF40 billion), a scheme for short-time work compensation (CHF6 billion) and benefits for one-person business ventures (CHF5.3 billion) as well as for the purchase of medical supplies. The package includes a government request for nearly CHF1.9 billion in aid for the Swiss aviation sector, including the two carriers Swiss International Airlines and Edelweiss, as well as aviation service companies Swissport International, Gategroup and SR Technics. Left-wing parties tried to link aid to environmental standards but their demands were rejected.    Emergency relief was also agreed for sport organisations, cultural institutions and for tourism. The other parliamentary chamber, the House of Representatives, had given its approval in principle on Monday, the first day of an extraordinary session in Bern. Additional spending was agreed for day-care facilities for children despite opposition from the government, which wanted to leave the funding to the cantonal authorities. Both chambers also came out in favour of loans for the struggling media sector to help both newspapers and broadcasters cope with the crisis. Proposals, notably by the right-wing Swiss People’s Party to cut spending on cultural organisations, were voted down. Finance Minister Ueli Maurer repeatedly warned against extending the financial relief package to additional sectors. He has forecast a budget deficit of up to CHF50 billion this year. In total, about CHF66 billion have been earmarked to get the Swiss economy back on its feet, according to the Federal Finance Administration. The rescue package was drawn up by the Swiss government following the introduction of emergency lockdown restrictions imposed on public life and business activities in March to curb the spread of the pandemic. Meanwhile, parliament has retroactively given the green light for the deployment of up to 8,000 members of the armed forces to support hospitals as well as border guards. Critics have argued the army command overreacted by calling up too many soldiers, but senior officers dismissed the allegations.   It was the first mobilisation of the militia army since World War Two.

2020-05-05;‘Switzerland is going to face an unimaginable level of poverty’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_-switzerland-is-going-to-face-an-unimaginable-level-of-poverty-/45738264;The endless queues for food bags in Geneva show that while the health crisis seems to be subsiding, the economic crisis has only just begun, warns political journalist Grégoire Barbey.  Switzerland is slowly emerging from lockdown. Many economic activities have already resumed, and most will be able to re-open on May 11. Although the recovery is eagerly awaited, it will not take place without the observance of protective measures to safeguard public health from the dangers of Covid-19.  Although Swiss efforts have succeeded in curbing the spread of the virus, its presence remains. We will therefore have to live with it, and this will have consequences for the economy. Businesses will not be able to resume with the same freedoms as before, and the constraints that lie ahead will weigh on the income of many sectors. The financial consequences of the health crisis are difficult to assess accurately. Everyone is making their own predictions. Although they differ in terms of duration and magnitude, they all agree on one thing: the economic slump will have a serious impact on society, and the economy will take time to return to pre-crisis levels. Although the health crisis may last for a while, the economic crisis it caused will outlive it and will undoubtedly last several years.  In the Tribune de Genève, the head of the Geneva café-owners association estimates that around a third of establishments will not be able to re-open as a result of the crisis. The figure is sobering. And catering is not the only sector concerned. Many companies will have no choice but to throw in the towel. Projects will be postponed indefinitely or even abandoned owing to a lack of clear prospects in the coming years.  The difficult decisions taken by the government to limit the transmission of the coronavirus will undoubtedly have saved lives, but paradoxically they will also have indirectly pushed many human lives into poverty or at least into financial uncertainty.  Social insurance will have to cope – and is already doing so – with a wave of new beneficiaries, be it for unemployment or social welfare. Although the government is trying to limit the damage, people will fall through the social safety net and will not get help to support themselves. For many, debt will be the only prospect of survival.  Switzerland, which in recent years has enjoyed fantastic economic wealth and unprecedented success, will in the very near future have to deal with hordes of people in difficulty. Is Switzerland ready to face this challenge? Nothing could be less certain. In this small country that holds itself in very high esteem, failures are not very well received, either culturally or institutionally.  In a country where individual responsibility is established as absolute dogma and where work is an indisputable social distinction, the imponderables of life are the object of all sorts of suspicions. Debt? Obviously a sign of poor financial management. Long-term unemployment? A clear demonstration of laziness and a blatant lack of willpower. Illness? An excuse to rely on the state.  That’s exaggerating somewhat, but it’s not a million miles from reality. Being poor in Switzerland is a cross to bear and one has to prove one’s honesty again and again in order to hope to be considered a human being like any other. In Switzerland, poverty reverses the burden of proof: anyone who receives support from the community is considered an abuser.  Although the economic crisis is still in its infancy, it will be about as severe as the one that followed the Second World War. Perhaps even more so, since the world economy is much more globalised today than 70 years ago. Honest people are going to lose everything, including and above all their jobs, and therefore their financial and social stability and perhaps even their health, since all these elements are closely linked.  If Switzerland wants to be able to support the victims of the crisis, it will have to show courage. Because this will mean questioning its own way of working and its view of individual life paths.  It is also at the political level that measures to deal with the economic crisis will be played out. Will parliament and the government be able to make concessions to improve state support? Even though tax revenues are likely to fall significantly as individuals and corporate entities suffer. Confronting this situation will require a high degree of adaptability and, much more importantly, a willingness to question.  Health Minister Alain Berset has constantly reminded us that, when it comes to health, not everything is simple and we must show humility, even if it means going back on positions that have just been taken following new information. Will the political class live up to this demand for humility, even in reference to the economic aspect of the crisis?  Compromises will have to be made on both sides of the political spectrum. The social cohesion of our country must not be undermined by the crisis. That is why it is important to discuss without taboos the measures that will have to be taken to limit the damage and to reduce the pressure on those who will pay the price for this economic cataclysm.  Is it time for an unconditional income mechanism? Do we need to redefine the way prosecutions are kept for five years on cantonal records to reduce the negative consequences of a complicated financial situation? How about reforming social assistance to make it more suitable for a return to the job market rather than turning it into a siding where people are belittled and artificially kept in hardship?  Switzerland is going to face a level of poverty that was unimaginable just a few months ago. The queues for the distribution of basic foodstuffs in cities such as Geneva, where thousands of people queue for hours, are a visible symptom of this.  For a long time Switzerland has had two faces: a presentable one – that of success – and another, darker, one which wanted to keep those left behind in the dark. But since their numbers are going to increase drastically in the coming months, there is no doubt that the time has come to abandon this separation between a Switzerland that wins and a Switzerland that pays the price. The two must come together to form a single nation, whose greatest strength is its ability to show solidarity in the most difficult times.  This is a daunting task for our authorities. Let us hope that they rise to the occasion. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-05-05;Coronavirus forces OC Oerlikon to slash 800 jobs;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-fallout_coronavirus-forces-oc-oerlikon-to-slash-800-jobs/45737816;Swiss technology group OC Oerlikon says it will cut 800 jobs worldwide in the face of an economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Orders in the first three months of 2020 fell nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, with revenues sagging 15%. The company’s surface solutions divisions, which provides coatings for a variety of sectors, has been particularly badly hit by the downturn in the automobile and aircraft industries. Headcount in the business segment will be reduced 10% - or by 800 positions - the group said on TuesdayExternal link. The company said the job cuts will occur “across geographies” but would not specify which production sites or specific countries would be affected. The raft of redundancies is expected to cost the company between CHF25 million and CHF35 million ($26 million to $36 million), mostly in severance payments. The group said it wants to reduce expenditure by at least CHF100 million this year compared to 2019. Several plants had been forced to temporarily shutter their doors during the pandemic, including 13 in China in February and 25 in a variety of other locations, including Spain, Italy, India, Malaysia and Mexico. The pandemic has also severely disrupted vital supply chain and logistics operations, the company said at its first quarter results presentation in Zurich. The one positive note for OC Oerlikon during the pandemic was an increase in global demand for products used to manufacture face masks.

2020-05-05;Coronavirus leaves irregular migrants in Switzerland in precarious situation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus-leaves-irregular-migrants-in-switzerland-in-precarious-situation/45735958;The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the challenges faced by the estimated 100,000 irregular migrants, also called ‘sans papiers’, in the small Alpine nation known for its high cost of living.  “I have friends and we help each other, but this time we've all been affected by the crisis. A friend of mine, who is married to a Swiss man, is lending me money to survive. The coronavirus has caused the spread of poverty here,” says Mariana*, a 34-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic who works as a house cleaner. “Two families still pay me for the hours I normally work for them every week, even if I don't go to their homes. They tell me that I can compensate them later by doing an extra hour of cleaning, but other families can't do this as they are foreigners who have lost their jobs or they don't need me because they are at home.”  Today, Mariana lives with friends in a village near the town of Murten in canton Fribourg in north-west Switzerland. She remains hopeful that as shops and businesses slowly start up, she will find new ways to survive.  “I'm thinking of asking for farming work, even though I don't know anyone I trust there. A young refugee told me that some farmers are accepting people without permits to grow asparagus. He works with them now and also receives money from social assistance. That seems unfair to me, but that's all there is. I have not been a burden for the state. I have supported myself, but today I cannot clean houses because of the pandemic.” Switzerland is no different to many other countries – irregular migrants do the many jobs that locals do not want to do. They build houses, clean, cook, take care of children or even work as prostitutes. In good times, they can earn enough to eat, pay their rent and send home money to their relatives in their countries of origin.  In difficult times, they are the hardest hit, lacking the same safety net as other workers in the country.  “Is there any financial support to help people pay their rent?” asks Hector*, an irregular migrant from Nicaragua, who lives with his wife and two children in Switzerland. He and his wife have been unemployed since early March. They must still pay CHF1,000 ($1,036) per month for rent and desperately need help. During the coronavirus crisis, various organisations and support centres in Zurich, Lucerne, Basel, Bern, Geneva and Lausanne have been able to help with basic expenses by providing things like food vouchers. But requests for advice and financial support have continued to flood in. “In Zurich, over 400 people have called us for financial aid to cover essential expenses during confinement,” explained Bea Schwager, head of the Zurich centre SPAZExternal link.  As soon as Swiss businesses were forced to close during the lockdown, SPAZ made a public appeal for donations.  “We have received about CHF100,000 but much of that money has already been spent,” said Schwager. “We suspended the distribution of financial support because we have to re-evaluate how to continue this work.” Myriam Schwab of the Protestant Social Centre (CSP) in canton Vaud says the biggest fear is not knowing how long the current situation will last. “Although providing financial support is not our main activity, which is counselling, we are currently looking to obtain funds to help people who do not have access to public assistance in the current emergency situation,” she said.  People are living from day to day and aside from basic needs like food, paying rent is the main unresolved problem, explained Byron Allauca, president of the Vaud Collective in Support of Sans Papiers (CVSSP).  “Many people have not been able to cover April's rent. [The charity] Caritas helps them with vouchers to buy cheaper food in shops and the Protestant church movement provides them with food rations. In Lausanne, for example, before the crisis the Protestant church gave out 80 food rations. Today it distributes 350,” he said. In mid-April, the CSP and CVSSP, together with other Vaud organisations, wroteExternal link to the federal, cantonal and municipal authorities appealing for financial aid and other support for the most vulnerable, including undocumented migrants. However, they have not yet received a reply. Meanwhile, Socialist Democrat parliamentarian Ada Marra, who is co-president of the national platform of the sans-papiers, on Tuesday filed an official request with the Federal Council calling for the setting up of a fund to be distributed to associations that help irregular migrants. Unfortunately, the situation in Switzerland is unlikely to improve with the end of confinement, warned Schwab. “It will be difficult for those without papers to find work in Switzerland in the future. Access to employment is crucial for their survival, but we have entered a very bleak period. And you only have to look at the history of immigration in Switzerland to know that in a crisis it is always the most vulnerable foreign workers who suffer the most. They are ones who have to leave the country, she declared. *names have been changed to protect anonymity. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-05;Controls extended on German-Swiss border;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_controls-extended-on-german-swiss-border/45737372;Germany has prolonged border checks with Switzerland and other neighbouring countries until May 15 to ensure that the new coronavirus is ‘further successfully contained’, according to the interior ministry.  Border controls introduced in mid-March to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be extended between Germany and Switzerland, Austria, France, Luxembourg and Denmark. The extension also applies to flights between Germany and Spain and Italy. On the Swiss side, Switzerland’s land and air borders with Germany, Austria and France were closed on March 17. Previously strict border controls were put in place with Italy from March 13 to curb the spread of the virus and were extended to all other Schengen and non-Schengen states on March 25.  Only Swiss citizens, Swiss resident permit-holders, those entering the country for professional reasons (e.g., those who work here and have a permit to prove it), essential health workers, those transiting through or “in a situation of absolute necessity”, can currently enter Switzerland.External link   Strict Swiss border controls remain in place for the foreseeable future. However, last week the Federal Council announcedExternal link that from May 11 it would slightly ease lockdown measures, processing the backlog of applications made by non-Swiss citizens to work or rejoin family in Switzerland.   Germany is slowly starting to reopen and ease coronavirus measures. But on the German side of the border, people who are neither German nor permanent residents may only enter Germany if they have a valid reason to travel. EU citizens travelling through Germany to their home country or truck drivers are allowed to enter the country, for example. Entry is also restricted to certain border crossings. Austria is also preparing for a gradual, secure and monitored re-opening. Temporary land border controls remain in place with neighbours until May 7. People travelling to Austria from neighbouring countries like Switzerland must currently produce a valid medical certificate proving a negative Covid-19 test result upon entry. The certificate cannot be older than 4 days when entering Austria. Without the certificate, entry will be denied. Meanwhile, passenger train services between Austria and Switzerland remain suspended and there is limited air traffic. France also imposed strict border restrictions – only residents, cross-border worker, health workers and people in transit can enter after completing an entry certificate. However, it is preparing to gradually lift lockdown measures from May 11. The authorities said on Sunday that when it comes into effect it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area, which includes Switzerland, or Britain. At the moment - and this will continue until at least May 18 - travel into and within Italy is heavily restricted and limited to emergencies, work and health reasons.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-05;How Swiss people are experiencing lockdown in India;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_how-swiss-people-are-experiencing-lockdown-in-india/45737244;"Since March 25 some 1.3 billion people have been part of the world’s largest lockdown in India to combat the spread of Covid-19. A few hundred Swiss people were caught up in it, most of whom have since been repatriated. But some chose to stay.  In India, Swiss tourists last week took advantage of the last repatriation flight to Zurich. Organised by the Swiss government, it left Kolkata on April 25 and made a stopover in Kochi in southern India.  The Swiss embassy in Delhi says 534 people were able to reach Zurich from India on three repatriation flights: 234 Swiss citizens, 120 holders of residence permits and 180 citizens or permit holders from European Union (EU) member states and third countries. In addition, 95 Swiss citizens and permit holders reached Switzerland on flights organised by EU states.  Barbara Droux, a 51-year-old yoga teacher from Geneva, was one of them. She returned at the end of April on a KLM flight via Amsterdam. She had landed in Delhi on March 3 before leaving for Rishikesh, a town in the foothills of the Himalayas about 200km north-east of the capital. The yoga course she had signed up for was interrupted after the start of the Indian government’s lockdown and was cancelled permanently the next day.  “I was lucky because that day I changed guest houses. Using the only bridge to cross the Ganges river was then banned,” she says by phone in a taxi to Delhi. She was able to discreetly buy daily takeaway meals in a restaurant just a stone’s throw from her accommodation. At first the lockdown was between 7am and 10am, then until 1pm.  “We had to be careful that the police didn’t see us, because that restaurant wasn’t really authorised. We were allowed to move around – but solely to go food shopping. We never ran out of food,” she says.  At the beginning of April, Droux received two repatriation offers from the Swiss embassy in Delhi. But she turned them down. She already had a flight scheduled for April 13 with Turkish Airlines. It was postponed until April 19 before being cancelled for good. The Swiss embassy then offered her two flights with KLM, on April 26 or 28. She went for the earlier one. “It’s the third flight I’ve bought,” she says. But she was not yet out of the woods. She still had to deal with Indian bureaucracy. A travel pass for her and her taxi driver was essential. Sent by the Swiss embassy, the document had to be filled out by the local police. It then had to be returned to the Swiss representation, which would have it validated by the Indian authorities.  “In a WhatsApp group of stranded tourists I couldn’t find anyone to share the transport costs. I couldn’t fill out the document before the four-day deadline. The embassy warned me on Saturday that it would be too late and I was already thinking that I’d lose my flight again,” she said.  But the manager of her guesthouse gave her a hand and took her to the police station. He sorted out all the necessary documents. “Without him, I’d still be in Rishikesh,” Droux says. In the end, she feels she was luckier than some tourists in southern India who have been victims of racism (foreigners have been seen by some as responsible for bringing the virus into the country). Rishikesh was like a cocoon for her.  Unlike Barbara Droux, another Swiss woman – who prefers to remain anonymous for personal reasons – decided to stay in India. The thirty-something from Lausanne had left Switzerland last August because of health problems. She came to India in the hope of getting better through yoga. After three months of study in Rishikesh, she continued her training in Goa, where she stayed for three months.  A week before the lockdown was announced, she flew back to Rishikesh to continue her studies. “This has been a very difficult time for me. Five days before my trip, my lungs hurt and I had a sore throat. In Goa there were quite a lot of people and I was afraid I’d caught the coronavirus,” she says by phone.  These health problems lasted 24 days. To treat herself, she resorted to alternative medicine and followed the recommended measures of distance and hygiene.  “I was on my guard while no case of coronavirus had been reported in Rishikesh. In fact, I couldn’t tell anyone about my symptoms. I had to avoid being quarantined, because in India that wouldn’t have been much fun,” she says.  When she passes a group of Indians, she sometimes hears one of them mutter “Corona”. Then they put on their masks. “In this small farming village next to Rishikesh most people don’t know much about the virus. Their reaction to strangers is fear linked to ignorance,” she says.  Having recovered, she looked after the homeless. With other tourists, she organised fundraisers on Facebook to distribute food. She says she went through some highs and lows during the early days of the lockdown. One day hope, the next day pessimism.  “We feared the economy would collapse; we were afraid that racism towards foreigners would become unbearable. A lot of people come here during the high season from all over the world. I was convinced that cases of coronavirus were going to explode. That hasn’t happened, but this week people tested positive for the first time. Our travel is more limited,” she says.  Stay or go? It’s a question she has asked herself dozens of times, just like the other Swiss from Rishikesh in a WhatsApp group. “Everything can change overnight, but I’m happy here despite the lack of comfort compared with Switzerland,” she says.  Christophe Perrin, 40, has lived in Mumbai with his Indian wife for nine years. The couple’s world has really been shaken up. Gaia Gourmet, their home-catering business, ceased all activity overnight.  “Our business was doing very well until the crisis. We’re well known in Mumbai. We served companies, consulates and Bollywood actors. But as all events have stopped, we had to close our business on March 18, a few days before the government announced the lockdown. We’ve asked our employees to take their holidays and we’re paying them their salaries,” Perrin says by phone. He and his wife are thinking about the future of their business. He feels that it will have to adapt, as it will take time before people start gathering again for parties.  “We’ll probably have to get into the home-delivery business. That way, we’ll be able to get our team, which normally comprises about 15 permanent employees, working again. But we’re not sure. We hope it will work. In any case, I don’t think home parties will restart until Diwali [a major Hindu festival in November],” he says.  Outside of the business, he’s calmly living in lockdown with his wife and two-year-old daughter. He goes out only to buy food, at the bottom of his building where a lorry delivers rice and vegetables. He can also rely on the stocks he has been able to take home.  “We’ll remain closed until the end of May. I don’t want to take any risks with my employees. Before we get going again, they will all be tested,” he stresses.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-04;Switzerland wants Covid-19 treatments to be accessible for all;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-wants-covid-19-treatments-to-be-accessible-for-all/45736190;Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga says every country in the world should have access to diagnostic tools, medicine and – once available – a vaccine to counter the coronavirus. Sommaruga outlined Switzerland’s position on Monday during a virtual donor conference organised by the European Union. In her video address, the Swiss leader stated that solidarity must go beyond addressing the health needs generated by the Covid-19 crisis. Keystone-SDA news agency quoted her as saying that it is not enough to save part of humanity from the pandemic and then let it die of hunger and poverty. Switzerland, she noted, has already allocated CHF400 million ($415 million) to support international efforts to tackle Covid-19. Another CHF18 million have been granted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to accelerate the search for medicines. Switzerland will decide on additional funding in the coming weeks. Separately, about thirty humanitarian associations urged the Swiss government to boost efforts to combat the pandemic and its socio-economic consequences, especially in the poorest countries. They called on Bern to allocated 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) to development aid, instead of the current 0.5%.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The bulk of the loan guarantee (65%) is provided by the government. The remainder is provided by the cantons or third parties appointed by the cantons.   Start-ups can submit a loan guarantee applicationExternal link online and will be assessed on their eligibility. Cantonal agencies can consult an expert group which is coordinated by Innosuisse – the Swiss Innovation Agency – during the evaluation period if needed. This group submits an assessment of whether the companies applying meet the requirement as science- or technology-based start-ups.  Last month, the Swiss government decided to extend the existing bailout system for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to start-ups.  The coronavirus pandemic has left start-ups around the world strapped up for cash – with many having less than three to six months of cash in hand.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-04;Coronavirus confinement leaves most Swiss stressed;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-psychology_coronavirus-confinement-leaves-most-swiss-stressed/45717112;The partial confinement measures introduced to combat the coronavirus in Switzerland has left one in two people feeling more stressed than before, according to a survey conducted by the University of Basel. One in four participants felt less stressed and the remainder were unaffected. These preliminary results of the Swiss Corona Stress Study are based on the responses of more than 10,000 people across Switzerland during the period of April 6 to 8 April, three weeks after lockdown measures were introduced by the government. Heightened stress levels are attributed to changes in work or school, as well as restricted social life or childcare, according to the survey. Depressive symptoms became more acute for 57% of participants. The frequency of severe depressive symptoms jumped to 9.1% during semi-confinement compared to 3.4% before the virus broke out in the Alpine nation. Surprisingly, 26% of those surveyed felt less stressed than before the crisis, according to the authors. Another quarter (24.4%) said they had felt no difference. These results cut across differences in gender, age, belief and education. Researchers credited increased physical activity and new hobbies or projects for helping people keep stress level downs. Limited consumption of information on the coronavirus also appeared to have a positive effect. The anonymous online surveyExternal link is still underway to investigate how the loosening of confinement affects psychological well-being.

2020-05-04;Parliament resumes its role as political watchdog;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-session_parliament-to-resume-its-role-as-political-watchdog/45722650;This week’s session of the Swiss parliament is special for more than one reason as it marks a new phase in the political handling of the coronavirus crisis. Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga on Monday urged lawmakers to engage in dialogue to find solutions which can be supported by the population today and which will still be considered reasonable and just tomorrow . The venue of the four-day-gathering is a functional building on the outskirts of the city of Bern. The flat-roofed conference centre usually hosts congresses and trade fairs. Its largest rooms could each just about fit a football pitch – enough space for the 246 parliamentarians and staff to respect the two-metre social distancing rules to avoid close physical contact and possible infections with the Covid-19 virus. The atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the stately historical parliament buildingExternal link in the city centre where sessions normally take place. Although it required special arrangement, politicians and political scientists agree that the time has come for parliament to resume its work after the spring assembly was cut short. The speakers of the two parliamentary chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate, stressed the importance of the constitutional role of parliament to oversee the work of the government. “Parliament is the highest authority and must assume its role as watchdog of the government in times of crises,” said the speaker of the Senate, Hans Stöckli. It is worth convening the chambers despite extra costs of about CHF3.5 million ($3.6 million), he argues. Political experts have also come out over the past few weeks pointing out the crucial importance of the elected assembly in democracy. Parliament in mid-March decided by itself to suspend work for several weeks and put on hold citizens’ direct democratic rights, including nationwide votes and the collection of signatures. The move came in the wake of a government decision to put in place emergency rule due to the Covid-19 pandemic, giving it the power to take measures to stem the spread of the virus. Under Swiss law, the government emergency rule could in theory remain in place for six months before parliament is given a say on whether to extend it. During that period, a unit in the justice ministry is the sole authority which can remind the executive to stay within the limits of the constitution. It is generally acknowledged that the Swiss government has not abused its extra powers following the emergency declaration more than seven weeks ago. The emergency regulation is valid until September 13. On Monday, Sommaruga said the government would submit to parliament any measures still deemed necessary for review by September 11. Government ministers have repeatedly stressed the close co-operation among the country’s 26 cantons, the business community and trade unions, dispelling potential concerns about a power grab by the executive. Criticism of specific measures and decisions has only recently begun to emerge. Surprised by the pandemic, all political parties at first rallied behind the government and the media seemed shell-shocked for weeks, observers have pointed out. Political analyst Claude Longchamp argues that parliament must meet even in times of crises. “Democracy needs parliament to keep the government in check and parliaments have to present alternative options,” LongchampExternal link said in an opinion piece published by swissinfo.ch in German. He says the role of democratic institutions is to ensure a public debate about political issues. “Under the current situation, this has not been possible,” says Longchamp. Wolf Linder, a senior political scientist, argues that parliament should have acted earlier. He worries that parliamentarians will use the session to hone their political profiles in a bid to attract media attention. Parliament should be critical of the relief package announced to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, he said. “The purpose of the session must go beyond the belated approval a multi-billion payment. It is also about changes and amendments,” he told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper. Doubts were also raised about the short time given to prepare for the session, as the agenda was compiled at the last minute, ruling out a thorough examination. But politicians argue the various parliamentary committees have been given a chance to scrutinise government decisions and other tabled proposals. Apart from a speech by President Simonetta Sommaruga, the agenda published on Friday includes a debate about the multi-billion franc relief package and the mandate of the armed forces in supporting civilian authorities in hospitals, at the borders and at foreign embassies during the Covid-19 crisis. Additional proposals from several parliamentary committees are aimed at extending the relief package to sectors of the economy or groups of people unable to benefit from government aid so far. Other proposals seek to limit spending amid criticism of the government Covid-19 strategy. The shortage of medical equipment, including hygiene masks is likely to be one of the issues, given statements made by politicians from the right and the left as well as from interest groups ahead of the session. Some politicians might also try to push for a reform of the parliamentary system, such as through the establishment of so-called select committees which would allow parliament to remain functional even in times of emergency law. Another issue may be the use of digital technology for sessions, including video conferences over the internet. Senator Stöckli seems rather sceptical about the idea of a remote parliament. “Parliament relies on personal contacts. I’m not sure it is possible to do a good job if members have to work from home,” he said. It didn’t stop parliament from setting up a live video chat between the speakers of parliament and citizens next week. Discussions about new digital forms of parliament are unlikely to go away. Experts are weighing options, including necessary legal amendments and technological risks. Reservations about the aesthetics of the congress centre and its bland interior design seem minor in light of discussions about digital parliamentary sessions. Still, assemblies outside the parliament building are a rare occurrence, having happened only three times before in Swiss history – all within the past 30 years.   Each time parliament was re-located for a three-week session – to Geneva in 1993, Lugano in 2001 and Flims in 2006 – the temporary exile was due to renovation work at the Bern parliament building which was inaugurated nearly 120 years ago.

2020-05-04;Swiss government criticised for Covid-19 micromanagement;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/restrictions-_swiss-government-faces-criticism-for-micromanagement-over-covid-19-measures/45734770;The president of Switzerland’s upper house of parliament has criticised the seven-member governing Federal Council of micromanagement over the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.   In an interview published in several Swiss media outlets on Monday, Hans Stöckli acknowledged that the Federal Council put the common interest first during the coronavirus crisis. However, he was not pleased with the manner in which the easing of restrictions was handled. The big distributors could sell books but not bookshops, grandparents are allowed to kiss their grandchildren but not babysit them, museums can open on May 11 but zoos only on June 8, he said.   According to Stöckli, such details should not be dictated by a statutory body such as the Federal Council. They should be decided in consultation with the people concerned and decisions should be based on clear criteria, he said.  Stöckli identified several areas for improvement: in particular, the digitalisation of parliamentary work, clarification of the procedure for the declaration of an extraordinary situation by the government and the drafting of a report by the Federal Council on this period governed by emergency law.   The criticism comes just as parliament begins a special session, marking a new phase in the political handling of the coronavirus crisis.  Stöckli was not the only one who had harsh words for the government. On Sunday, tourism entrepreneur Samih Sawiris described Switzerland’s response as overkill in an interview with the German-language SonntagsZeitungExternal link paper.   Billions of francs lost for a few hundred fewer deaths, said the Egyptian investor.    According to him, the effort to save people under 60 from Covid-19 is out of proportion to the damage to the economy.  So far, there have been less than 200 deaths in Switzerland in this age group [under 60]. You're more likely to win the lottery than die of Covid-19, he said.   On the other hand, Sawiris had praise for the cantonal government of Uri, where his luxury ski resort The Chedi Andermatt is located. Canton Uri had ordered a complete lockdown for people over 65 at the beginning of the crisis, but the measure was annulled by the federal government. Sawiris said it was a pity that this did not become a model for the whole of Switzerland as it would have allowed more businesses to remain open while still protecting high-risk groups.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-03;‘We need a new way of thinking about how parliament works’ ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/digital-democracy_-we-need-a-new-way-of-thinking-about-how-parliament-works--/45728354;"Under emergency powers, the Swiss government has taken the reins in guiding the nation’s response to Covid-19. As parliament prepares to get back to work, digital democracy activist Daniel Graf discusses how the crisis will impact participatory politics in the future. swissinfo.ch: Both halves of Switzerland’s semi-direct democracy, the people and the parliament, have been sidelined by the virus. How big a problem is this for democracy? Daniel Graf: People in Switzerland generally trust that the government is doing its best to solve the crisis while taking citizens’ concerns into account. There are public debates about the measures, but there is no sense that something is going seriously wrong. However, we don’t see behind the scenes in Bern, where measures are being fast-tracked and heavily influenced by lobbyists. Normally, citizens would have oversight on decisions like the aviation sector bailout, and even if they couldn’t vote on it, they could demonstrate against it. But even demonstrating on the street is not an option right now. swissinfo.ch: Could the parliament have been more involved digitally? D.G.: Before, when we started talking about digitalisation, nobody listened, especially in parliament itself. The thinking was always to protect the status quo, keep things as they were. Now it’s clear that this is a topic that needs to be discussed. It’s unbelievable that a central institution of our society could not perform its core oversight function without physically being in Bern. We need a new way of thinking about how parliament works. Digitalisation will be a priority in the next months.  ​​​​​​​swissinfo.ch: What would such digitalisation look like? D.G.: The main point is that it’s not just about video conferences. And it’s not simply copying what happens offline onto an online platform. The beauty of it is that you can develop a digital system according to new goals – getting citizens more involved, for example. Parliament is very old-fashioned in the sense that you have to be there to participate; technology can open this up. More transparency around who is meeting and talking with whom is also possible. But this is what always leads to pushback. Parliament is like an old castle, full of dark corners and rooms, with only the lucky few allowed inside. Many don’t want this to change. swissinfo.ch: E-voting is still off the table, including for the national votes in September. Will it come back onto the agenda after coronavirus? D.G.: What we have learned from this crisis is that trust is the highest value in a democracy. In Switzerland, this also applies to votes. People trust that the outcome is accurate – this is why you never see protests in Bern after a result has been announced. The security flaws found in e-voting systems in the past year make it clear that it would have been a bad choice to go ahead with rolling it out on a large scale. I would say the barriers are actually higher now than before, since trust has been shown to be so important. swissinfo.ch: Will the crisis lead to more people being willing to cede some privacy – in the form of a contact tracing app for example? D.G.: With a contact tracing app, we’re talking about fundamental privacy. It’s not just accepting to be tracked online; it’s revealing where you are physically, who you are meeting. As for the technology, normally it would take months or years to develop, but we may be using it on a large scale very soon. If the health situation remains serious, people might risk it. But right now the trend seems headed in the opposite direction; as the curve flattens, and we move away from the extreme outcome, people are becoming more critical. swissinfo.ch: Will we see a rise in digital campaigning by political parties over the next months, since social distancing rules mean they can’t organise large gatherings? D.G. I think there will only be a small effect on campaigning. Here, the world remains more or less the same before and after coronavirus. But perceptions will shift regarding the electronic collection of signatures for initiatives and referendums. Before the shutdown, e-collecting wasn’t much talked about. Now it’s very much an issue, especially because e-voting – previously the only thing the government was willing to consider – is flagging. The boost for e-collecting could be one of the best outcomes from the pandemic, from a democratic point of view. swissinfo.ch: Such crises can reveal gaps and underlying problems in societies and democracies. What has jumped out at you during this time? D.G.: Perceptions of our democratic system are slowly but surely going to change. Before, the idea was that the Swiss system worked really well, that nothing needed to change. We will begin to realise that it’s necessary to adapt it on an ongoing basis, using technology, just as we adapt other areas of our lives. Switzerland tends to think of its democratic system as set in stone; this crisis is showing that some of its tools need to become more flexible.

They tackle lockdown issues such as cancelled birthday parties, managing screen time and keeping in touch with loved ones.   Each book features a list of suggested games, recipes and craft projects, along with questions to help families and teachers talk about the pandemic with children.  There is also a digital element to the books: some of the activities at the end cover coding and algorithms.  The books were created in consultation with psychiatrist Serge Tisseron, who emphasised that parents should read the books with their children.   “They’re not designed for independent reading,” he said. “It’s helpful to remind parents that children have their own worries and fears about the situation we’re living through. They need reassurance and support in these unprecedented times.”  The first story was published on April 8 and has been downloaded over 10,000 times.

I don’t have any other sources of income,” Noemi, 23, who studies business and administration, told the 20 Minutes newspaper earlier this weekExternal link. She is relying on her savings at the moment.   The newspaper also heard from a 23-year-old student physiotherapist, who is receiving CHF170 a month due to short-time working (instead of her usual CHF600) from her job in a gym. She is also using her savings but could ask her family for help if needed. “This is not great though if you are no longer financially independent,” she told 20 Minutes.  + Pandemic pushes more Swiss businesses to short-time working   Universities have responded to calls for help by providing emergency funds. On April 24, for example, the University of Zurich announced an emergency assistance scheme of up to CHF6,000 per loan for its students. The criteria: students have no other financial or family support, little or no savings and cannot (yet) benefit from assistance measures provided by the government. Students will only have to pay back the amount that exceeds CHF3,000.External link  “Our office and other offices at the University of Zurich have been receiving a rise in enquiries over the past weeks from students asking for help due to being in financial distress because of the pandemic. The university then decided to introduce financial assistance for its matriculated students,” Brigitte Ortega, head of the university’s Student Financial Aid Office, told swissinfo.ch via email.  “Many students work part-time during their studies and have small budgets. So the sudden loss of several hundred Swiss francs can have a real effect.”  The University of Geneva has a schemeExternal link that includes loans for income replacement and medical expenses, and a look around the other universities uncovers funding in quite a few cases. “The University of Lucerne launched its corona bridging aid two and a half weeks ago for its students and 18 applications have been made,” the university’s head of communications, Dave Schläpfer, told 20 Minutes. Sums of CHF500-CHF1,500 are in play, which won’t have to be paid back, he said.  Responding to the news of the University of Zurich’s measures, the Swiss Students’ UnionExternal link said it welcomed the move. However, the union - which has been fielding a lot of calls from worried students - feels more could be done by the government. Most students in need only have access to university assistance funds, which are limited, it said.   “We find this every problematic as the responsibility is simply passed on to those affected, the students,” Francesco Bee, co-president of the union, told swissinfo.ch via email. Many students are not eligible for unemployment benefit or short-time working.   He said the union had requested more financial help from the governmentExternal link. This could take the form of an assistance fund, run with the cantons (who are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland) and universities, to allow students to receive fast and unbureaucratic help.  Students in Germany, who are heavily dependent on part-time jobs, are also feeling the financial pinch. A call for government help has been answered by the federal education minister. Anja Karliczek announced on ThursdayExternal link that students could request a €650 ($712) monthly emergency loan from May onwards from the state development bank KfW.  In the meantime, there is potential light at the end of the tunnel: retail stores are due to open again from May 11, as well as gyms and restaurants (with special hygiene measures). Theatres and cinemas can re-open from June 8. But how much this will mean a return to normal is as yet unclear.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-02;Government minister admits lack of clear communication on easing coronavirus measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/re-opening-switzerland_government-minister-admits-lack-of-clear-communication-on-easing-coronavirus-measures/45732338; Karin Keller-Sutter acknowledged the public’s confusion about loosening regulations to fight the pandemic in Switzerland, but defended the government’s back-pedalling on certain decisions.   The Swiss government did not clearly communicate the timetable for the gradual easing of measures or its protection strategy, the justice minister said in an interview published on Saturday in the CH Media group of newspapers.  Keller-Sutter referred specifically to the government’s original announcement that large supermarket chains that had remained open throughout the crisis would be able to sell non-essential items again on April 27, two weeks before other shops were allowed to re-open. The government had to backtrack on this decision following an outcry from retailers.  “This was well-intentioned, but was poorly communicated, and in the end only led to confusion,” she said.  Keller-Sutter rejected the idea that by easing the lockdown the government was more concerned about shoring up the economy than safeguarding public health. But she accepted criticism of the government’s actions.  “During confinement, everyone can be treated the same,” she said. Now, however, “various factors have to be taken into account in the stages of easing confinement.” This means there must be different treatment in different areas, she added.  A three-stage relaxation of confinement measures began on April 27 with the re-opening of certain businesses like hair salons and garden centres. Schools, restaurants and all other retailers will follow on May 11.  Speaking to Tamedia newspapers a day earlier, the minister, who is responsible for immigration matters, warned there is still no timetable for the re-opening of the country’s borders, which will be done on a case-by-case basis.  Neighbouring Austria could be one of the first countries to which travel may be possible, Keller-Sutter said, since its relaxation measures are similar to Switzerland’s, an important pre-requisite for allowing cross-border movement.  She added she was in close contact with her counterparts in European Union countries and that so far, there was no concrete indication that they are ready to welcome Swiss tourists this summer.   For trips further afield, she said that, according to experts, intercontinental tourist travel will probably not be possible in the usual way until next year.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-01;Face mask shortage being countered in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_face-mask-shortage-being-countered-in-switzerland/45731344;Around 35 million face masks were distributed across Switzerland by the end of April, the government’s top coronavirus pandemic officials have said, with more now available to the general public. In all, 12 million of the masks went to retail outlets and the rest to the cantons, said brigadier Markus Näf, in charge of procurement at the defence ministry, at a media conference on Friday. Face masks have been on sale in supermarkets like Migros, Volg and Coop since MondayExternal link. Näf said Switzerland had an additional 20 million masks in stock and the country was waiting for a further delivery which coming in on six airplanes. Cloth masks were also now available to the public, as EMPA , the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, had published recommended specificationsExternal link from the National COVID-19 Science Task Force for these items, the official added. Several Swiss companies are now producing these types of masks. The price of masks has also fallen by two-thirds over the last weeks, commented Näf. + Coronavirus: the current situation in Switzerland Like many countries, Switzerland had been facing shortage of face masks during the pandemic, replying on international imports to fill the gap.   + How Switzerland was caught napping over masks provision + Swiss researchers join forces to prevent mask shortages The country does not recommend the general wearing of masks for healthy members of the public, a move which continues to generate a lot of public debate. But officials say they may be warranted on public transport during rush hour traffic or similar settings in which socially distancing is difficult to maintain. In response to a question about masks and children, on Friday top health official Daniel Koch said that masks were only practical if someone could take them on and off independently and if they did not interfere with a person’s breathing. + Face masks advised on crowded trains and buses Although face mask wearing in public is not so common in Switzerland – apart from in the heavily affected canton of Ticino where according to a recent survey half the population sometimes wears a mask out and about – there seems to be widespread support for the practice. A separate survey published on April 20 suggested that 60% of respondents were in favour of a face mask regime in an effort to stem the spread of Covid-19.

2020-05-01;Contact tracing app ready this month, says expert;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-solution_contact-tracing-app-could-be-launched-in-switzerland-within-weeks/45706296;The decentralised contact tracing app DP-3T, designed to alert users who have come into contact with people infected with coronavirus, should be ready by May 11, or at least the second half of the month, says a government expert. Marcel Salathé, who heads the expert group on digital epidemiology, told a press conference on Friday that the system being developed for Switzerland has met interest from Google and Apple but gave reassurances as to user privacy. It will be offered by the Swiss federal government as an App that people can download on a voluntary basis.  Swiss health authorities are working with the European consortium behind the project with the aim of having the system ready for use in Switzerland. DP-3TExternal link is being offered as a digital antidote to the spate of nationwide lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic. The app employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days could be alerted so as to isolate themselves and get tested. Switzerland’s two Federal Institutes of Technology (ETHZ and EPFL) announced on April 21External link that the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing system, which can be downloaded onto smartphones, was close to completion. “It will be based on the DP-3T concept of EPFL and will leverage the new Google and Apple Contact Tracing APIs as soon as they are available,” Pascal Strupler, Director-General of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, is quoted as saying in a press release. ETHZ and EPFL had also been part of another European contact tracing app, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity TracingExternal link (PEPP-PT) system. But both institutions later pulled out of the project, saying that its use of centralised systems to store data did not respect personal privacy. The DP-3T project is part of the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Task ForceExternal link, a national scientific advisory board set up to tackle the pandemic.

2020-05-01;No unified plan for re-opening Swiss schools;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education-_no-unified-plan-for-re-opening-swiss-schools/45730990;Several more cantons confirmed on Friday how their schools will re-open on May 11. While some favour fully opening their doors, others are more cautious. The re-opening - which was confirmed by the government on Wednesday - applies to compulsory schools (with pupils up to the age of 16). Upper secondary schools are only allowed to open for small groups of pupils. Under Switzerland’s federal system, it’s the cantons that are in charge of educational matters – hence they have the last say in what happens. + Swiss government approves further easing of coronavirus restrictions While cantons such as Appenzell Outer Rhodes and Nidwalden have opted for “almost back to normal” from May 11 - allowing pupils to follow the regular school timetable unless they are in risk groups. Fribourg decided for a step-by-step approach, so classes will be divided into two and held on alternate days until May 20. All the cantons emphasized that they would keep to the national requirements drawn up by the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link - also issued on Wednesday - to protect the health of pupils and teachers. These include washing hands, more cleaning and airing of rooms, two metres social distancing between teachers and pupils, but no social distancing for pupils under ten (deemed too unrealistic) and no obligation to wear masks. Most of the 26 cantons have now explained how they will approach schools restarting. Zug will let parents know on May 5, just six days before the re-opening date. What is already clear is that there will be a wide range of approachesExternal link. The large German-speaking cantons of Zurich and St Gallen have gone for dividing classes into two for a month. Most other German-speaking cantons are diving back into full teaching programmes (Bern will do two days of half classes first to practice hygiene and distancing measures in small groups). Even Italian-speaking Ticino, which has been one of the worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak, is allowing normal resumption of school from May 11 under strict precautions. Schools are allowed to push back the start date by a week though. In the French-speaking part of Switzerland, it’s a little different. “The cantons of Geneva and Vaud have been very impacted by the coronavirus. There has been a request to restart school more progressively. We are being more cautious health-wise than other cantons,” said Cesla Amarelle, head of education in canton Vaud, on Swiss public television RTS on ThursdayExternal link. Vaud, for example, has opted for half classes on alternate days (one on Monday, another Tuesday etc) until May 25. School childcare options are in place for working parents. Geneva has gone for a part-time school approach, meaning either morning or afternoon teaching until May 25 for primary schools. The association of head teachers in Switzerland has already criticised the lack of a common solution among the cantons, as has the French-speaking teachers’ union SER. It saidExternal link teaching over the next weeks would be highly impacted by the health office’s measures and added that schools could only resume if everything was applied effectively. For its part, the German-speaking Federation of Swiss Teachers, while welcoming the return to face-to-face teaching, also regretted that national measures did not go far enough. “This protection concept will prompt many questions among parents when they see that schools are being re-opened differently depending on the canton, village or town or school house,” LCH president Dagmar Rösler told the Tages-AnzeigerExternal link. Top health official Daniel Koch again on Friday reiterated the government's stance that it wasn't problematic to re-open schools because children did not play a big role in transmitting the virus. There will not be an epidemic among pupils, Koch told reporters at a press conference.   The National COVID-19 Science Task Force also published a policy briefExternal link on the same day in which it stated that the role of children and adolescents in the transmission of SarsCov2 remained  highly uncertain .

2020-05-01;UN interns feel ‘left behind’ amid coronavirus pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva_un-interns-feel--left-behind--amid-coronavirus-pandemic/45730648;Interns at United Nations agencies in Geneva and in other parts of the world say their precarious work situation has been exacerbated with the outbreak of the virus.  A survey published by the Fair Internship Initiative (FII) lobby group on May 1 showed that two-thirds of respondents said their organisation had not implemented any kind of resiliency preparedness for interns. The poll was completed by 223 UN interns working for 37 UN agencies in 16 countries.  In all, 15% said their internships had been terminated due to the virus, while 34% had not received any guarantees about the completion of their work contract. “Interns feel left behind amid the pandemic,” FII spokesperson Albert Barseghyan told swissinfo.ch. “Interns were not taken into account when important coronavirus decisions were taken for staff and teams. Most people were not given any equipment to work from home. While UN staff get ten days’ sick leave, interns are unpaid and still have to work.” UN agencies employ thousands of interns around the world. There are an estimated 2,500 interns working for UN organisations in Geneva, of which 80% of are unpaid. Four out of ten interns said they had been forced to relocate owing to the pandemic. Most UN agencies, however, failed to inform interns about their legal situation in the countries where they were based.  Only one-third received assurances from their organisation about how to extend their legal status. Switzerland was an exception, offering to renew Cartes de Légitimation residence permits for anyone who was unable to return to their country of origin after the end of their internship.  “We see that those UN agencies that pay interns and give them a better learning experience, such as WHO, WIPO, ILO and UNHCR, are the ones who look after their interns,” said Barseghyan. “These organisations contacted us to inform us about their Covid-19 guidelines for staff, for example. WHO even gave a two-day webinar to explain to interns how to transition from the office to working remotely. Worries about Swiss apprentices The coronavirus pandemic has also raised huge concerns for the 215,000 young trainees who study and work for Swiss-based companies. A federal working group is examining the urgent issues affecting apprentices, such as whether firms are offering employment contracts during this difficult period. There are fears that certain sectors that traditionally employ apprentices, like the restaurant and hotel businesses, or industry, may cut back. “The risk is that, similar to what we experienced with the 2008 crisis, that if trainees are not hired during this period, 4-5 years later when they need to be operational and the market is booming, there is a lack of qualified staff,” Roger Beny, a professional training commissioner for canton Vaud, recently told Swiss public television (RTS).External link The Swiss Society for Business EmployeesExternal link has urged firms employing trainees not to terminate contracts despite the difficult economic situation. This week a Senate economics commission praised steps taken by the government on behalf of apprentices but encouraged it to continue its efforts to ensure that firms continue to recruit trainees.  As part of its business rescue package, in March the government also extended partial employment benefits to cover trainees. In April it announced changes to the exam and testing regime for the 75,000 apprentices completing their initial professional training.

2020-05-01;Protesting from home: Labour Day and coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/may-1_protesting-from-home--labour-day-and-coronavirus/45730652;"Covid-19 has succeeded where employers, fascists and wars failed. For the first time in 130 years, Labour Day cannot be celebrated in Swiss squares. The pandemic has forced trade unions, parties and social movements to come up with new forms of mobilisation, with protests moving online.  Switzerland is not usually associated with the history of the workers’ movement. Yet it is perhaps the only country in the world where May 1, Labour Day, has been celebrated without interruption since 1890.  Of course, this long tradition is due not so much to the strength of the Swiss workers’ movement – though that’s not irrelevant – as to the fact that Switzerland has remained more or less sheltered from the conflicts and political upheavals that characterised the history of the 20th century.  That said, during the Second World War the authorities obstructed the May 1 celebrations in various ways.  “In Geneva during the war public demonstrations were forbidden and the celebrations were held behind closed doors; elsewhere the authorities resorted to censorship, even preventive censorship, on slogans and banners to avoid friction with the fascist regimes in neighbouring countries,” says historian Bernard Degen.  Nevertheless, May 1 was also publicly celebrated during the war, albeit in a more relaxed tone than usual. But on May 1, 2020, silence will reign in Swiss squares. No slogans or speeches, no music, no sausages and beer.  In Switzerland, which has been hit badly by Covid-19, public demonstrations – including Labour Day protests – are banned. “And this time, unlike during the war years, the trade unions agree,” Degen says.  Unions and left-wing organisations have moved the Labour Day celebrations into the virtual world. The Swiss Federation of Trade Unions has been streaming a series of eventsExternal link – and the singing tradition of the workers’ movement hasn’t been forgotten.  The May 1 committee in Zurich has transferred speeches and debates to Radio LoraExternal link. At 11am the Zurich chapter of the trade union federation invited its supporters to show from their balconies their support for decent wages for all.  Solidarity was the watchword, with home affairs minister Alain Berset tweetingExternal link that it should not be forgotten when the corona crisis was over. However, several hundred people did hold a demonstration - with social distancing - in Basel, which was tolerated by police but officers in Zurich broke up small gatherings of protesters, citing security issues. “In online discussions we will address numerous issues related to the current situation,” says federation spokesman Urban Hodel. “The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty; it’s asking us new questions. Never before have we addressed so many issues on May 1.”  But is the union base ready for this step towards digitisation? “The reactions are very different,” he notes. “For reasons of age, some of our affiliates have no particular affinity with digital tools. But in recent years, unions have accumulated a lot of experience in using social networks.”  What’s missing, however, is the sharing of convivial moments. Bernard Degen points out that May 1 has always had two aspects: one is political, the other social – getting together, being together. This year there will be no party. And May 1, particularly in Zurich, remains a big holiday for the people.  “Many activists also earn some money with the food stands,” observes Bruna Campanello from Unia, Switzerland’s largest trade union, who has been part of the May 1 organising committee in Zurich for years. But the concerns of the leftwing organisations and activists now lie elsewhere.  “We have accepted, with responsibility, the limits imposed by the pandemic. But it’s clear to all of us that the struggle will become harder, that the pressure on workers will grow,” she says.  She points out that canton Thurgau, one of the few Swiss cantons where May 1 is a public holiday, decided a few days ago to allow companies that could only resume operations on April 27 to remain open on Labour Day to compensate for losses due to the lockdown.  “The question arises of how to carry out resistance in the current situation. There are limitations that we accept, but if we don’t open our mouths, it would be very serious. We must keep our heads up and our eyes open,” Campanello says.  The problem is not just about May Day and the trade unions. Many social movements are currently unable to physically mobilise their supporters and take their demands to the streets. First and foremost, the climate movement.  About ten days ago, a procession of cars organised in Zurich to express solidarity with refugees in Greece was broken up by the local police. On April 24, activists placed hundreds of shoes on a square in the same city as a symbol of an impossible protest as part of a global climate rally launched by Fridays for FutureExternal link.  The following day a march against pesticide manufacturers Bayer and Syngenta also took place only in virtual form.  Not even the large climate strike planned for May 15 in Switzerland will be able to repeat the exploits of last September, when tens of thousands of people filled the streets and squares of Bern to demand politicians do more against climate change. The event will be held online.  But what impact can political action have that remains confined to the virtual world and within the walls of the home? Can it have the same impact as a large street demonstration?  “The climate movement learnt as early as 2015 in Paris to find ways of expressing itself despite the limits imposed by a state of emergency [declared in France after the terrorist attacks in November 2015],” notes Bern-based activist Payal Parekh, who has experience in coordinating campaigns globally.  “Social networks offer effective tools for action. Just think of the campaign against climate-damaging investments by Credit Suisse, which involved Roger Federer.”  But there are limits, Parekh believes. Digital tools work well, especially on specific issues. Street demonstrations, on the other hand, make it possible to mobilise more broadly, on more general issues. They make it possible to create new contacts, to involve people outside the activists’ circles and to show how many you are. And, last but not least, they provide photogenic images for the media.  “The big demonstrations are undoubtedly important for building the identity of a movement,” says Marco Giugni, a political scientist at the University of Geneva and expert on social movements. “And visibility and capacity for disturbance are decisive for the success of demands. This is what experts mean with the English term ‘disruption’, a fundamental mechanism for obtaining concessions.”  All this is harder to get online, of course. On the other hand, Giugni says that digital tools have become fundamental in coordinating movements and their demonstrations.  “And perhaps the current situation will give a boost to the renewal of collective action,” he says. “The capacity for tactical innovation also plays a primary role in the success of social movements.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Transport companies will also step up cleaning and disinfecting, especially of surfaces that meet human contact.  Ducrot said this was not a return to normal but a “first step towards a return to normal”.

2020-05-01;French and German ambassadors urge coordinated border opening ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus--_french-and-german-ambassadors-urge-coordinated-border-opening-/45730228;The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the “common destiny” of Switzerland and European Union countries, which must now continue working together, say the French and German ambassadors to Bern.   After tensions in the early days of the crisis when each state took its own national emergency measures, Switzerland, Germany and France have developed “admirable solidarity”, write French ambassador Frédéric Journès and German ambassador Norbert Riedel in a joint piece published on Friday in the Tages Anzeiger and Le Temps newspapers.    They cite as examples Swiss and German hospitals taking coronavirus patients from France, and also the cooperation on repatriating stranded citizens from around the world. Swiss nationals have been flown home on French and German flights and vice versa.   This cooperation must now be maintained to get economic life back on track, the ambassadors says, urging a “coordinated reopening of borders”. Their message broadly reflects the view given by Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis last month.   “This exceptional period reminds us that, despite our differences, we are all Europeans,” they write. “The European response to this crisis, whether critics like it or not, is unprecedented. Never before has the [European] Union mobilised such considerable resources in just a few weeks. And never before have we become so aware of the importance of our common values, in particular respect for individual freedom and the rule of law.”   This week the ministers of justice and home affairs of Europe’s Schengen states agreed unanimously on a coordinated step-by-step lifting of travel restrictions while reaffirming the priority of protecting citizens against the virus.    “Initially, the progressive reopening of Europe’s internal frontiers must take place. Only after that will a step-by-step reopening of the Schengen external borders be possible to allow the entry of people from third states,” the Swiss justice ministry said in a statementExternal link.    This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-05-01;Where Switzerland stands on passive smoking;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/secondhand-smoke_where-switzerland-stands-on-passive-smoking/45729488;It’s been a decade since Swiss restaurant meals came with a side order of cigarette smoke. On May 1, 2010, a national law to protect people from passive smoking took effect in Switzerland. Before then, it was still possible to smoke in indoor public spaces such as restaurants, bars, schools, hospitals, dance clubs and shopping malls. Before the law’s implementation, restaurant and bar owners in particular worried they would lose business. But in 2010 – the year the ban came into effect – people in Switzerland spent over 13% more on eating out and going for drinks than they had the previous year. When those figures came out, GastroSuisse, the national federation of hoteliers and restaurants, noted that ban had not had the negative impact feared by so many. “In general, the smoking ban was actually very well implemented in the hotel industry. The same applies to restaurants and bars,” Vinzenz van den Berg, spokesman for trade association HotellerieSuisseExternal link, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “Practically all hotels today only offer non-smoking rooms, which is very much appreciated by smokers as well as non-smokers,” he added. Thanks to fumoirs, many establishments have been able to please smokers as well as non-smokers. And while anyone landing at Zurich Airport will likely have noticed the drab smoking booth between baggage claim and customs, there are certainly some grander options. “Luxury hotels in particular have created very stylish fumoirs with good ventilation and a wide array of cigars. So they’ve even been able to expand their offerings,” van den Berg pointed out. At the same time, bars and cafés under 80m2 may apply for “smoking” status in their cantons. The Swiss Lung LeagueExternal link finds that fumoirs and smoking establishments can be problematic. “The ventilation regulations leave some room for interpretation. Service personnel are therefore insufficiently protected. It is also disturbing that smoking in sports stadiums is not regulated,” spokeswoman Andrea Adam told SWI swissinfo.ch. The ban – which applies only to indoor spaces – does not include outdoor restaurant seating, for example. It is up to proprietors to decide whether or not to designate smoking and non-smoking sections – a potential disappointment during fine weather, depending on one’s preferences and which way the wind is blowing. There has been some momentum to improve conditions for train travelers in Switzerland. In 2005, the Swiss Federal Railways did away with smoking carriages on trains – partly because even smokers didn’t like to linger inside them. Last year, the Association of Public Transport backed a voluntary ban on smoking inside train stations – except for designated areas near entrances and on the platforms. It’s expected that nearly all stations will have made adjustments by mid-2020. Compliance, however, is hard to enforce. The Lung League finds the measures inadequate. “We had hoped for more courage on the part of the Swiss Federal Railways because the solution reached with the smoking zones is not really satisfying for smokers or non-smokers,” Adam said. She also highlighted another concern related to travel and smoking within enclosed spaces: “Many European countries have introduced a ban on smoking in cars if children or pregnant women are present. Switzerland should follow suit.” What do you think?

2020-04-30;Back to a new normal: democracy waking from Covid-19 hibernation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/newsletter_back-to--new--normal--democracy-waking-from-covid-19-hibernation/45728352;"Many parts of the world are cautiously reopening, with politicians heading back to parliament and citizens back to the ballot boxes. But things will not be the same as before.  It’s the biggest elected parliament in the world – China’s National People’s Congress. The annual gathering of the body (more than one per year is not necessary, due to the limited consultative powers of its 3,000 members and the unfree election process) was cancelled in March due to the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province late last year. But while the pathogen has since travelled the world, creating chaos, lockdown and the biggest economic crisis since the Second World War, the Communist regime in Beijing is now eager to get back to normal. In this case, the normal is not new: a crackdown on democracy supportersExternal link in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, continuing a strategy of undermining the city’s “Basic Law” agreed in 1997, when Hong Kong was incorporated into China. In more democratic contexts, however, the eagerness to get back to normal may amount to wishful thinking: the World Health OrganizationExternal link expects the Covid-19 pandemic to last for months, if not years. We are told that we have to learn to live with a global disease to which there is no vaccine, but basic protective rules: physical distancing, handwashing, staying at home, avoiding non-essential travel. Radical measures like closing borders, schools, restaurants and shops are obviously not sustainable in the long term; neither is the emergency legislation taken by many governments. And if parliaments are being called back to work – in Switzerland both houses are gathering for a special session next week – many fundamental participatory rights are still on hold for now. But don’t be impatient: the Swiss authorities just announced to hold a super-voting day (on no less than five issues) on September 27: included on the table will be a controversial people’s initiative on immigration and a referendum on the purchase of military fighter jets.  Many democracy reporters, meanwhile – including your newsletter editors – are closely monitoring these developments and exchanging information and observations online. For example, in North America the non-profit monitoring organization BallotpediaExternal link tracks Covid-19-related democracy developments in the United States day-to-day – and offers insights into the making of hundreds of citizen initiatives and referendums on their way towards decision dayExternal link on November 3. A similar serviceExternal link is provided by the Asian Network for Free Elections, ANFREL, based in Bangkok, and by Democracy International, headquartered in Cologne, which invites interested people from around the world to become a #CoronaDemocracyReporterExternal link. It also hosts global jam sessions online to discuss the options and challenges of democracy in times of a pandemic: the next one takes place this coming week, on Tuesday, May 5External link. Of course, we also encourage readers to follow our swissinfo democracy reportingExternal link. In a recent piece, I assessed the importance of social trust for keeping democratic governance running during the coronavirus. Another of our focuses is looking into the role of modern populism in Switzerland and across the world. Elsewhere, the latest Bertelsmann Transformation IndexExternal link (one of the most important democracy ranking studies), published on April 28, underlines the fascinating divisions emerging across the world between areas of more and areas of less democracy. Another key player in the measuring and comparison sector is the Gothenburg-based research group Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), who presented this week a Pandemic Backsliding Risk IndexExternal link. It calculates an almost even split across the globe: while 48 countries are at risk of democratic decline during the Covid-19 pandemic, some 47 countries are not at risk. “This proves that responding to the pandemic is possible without jeopardizing democratic standards”, said Anna Lührmann, Deputy Director of V-Dem. Anna, to whom I talked yesterday, identifies another fascinating democracy trend in times of Corona: “going digital”. Over the past few months we have all learnt to work and connect digitally, with governments, parliaments and citizens all now considering how to establish and develop online platforms for future use. And while a few countries like Estonia or FinlandExternal link – and the European Union when it comes to the European Citizens InitiativeExternal link – have been leading moves towards digital democracy, in Switzerland skeptical voices have worked to slow this development and even to stop the possibility for Swiss citizens abroad, like myself, to participate in votes online. It’s probably not just wishful thinking to imagine that this whole debate around e-voting and other forms of digital participation will emerge again soon in light of the experiences we have had during this extraordinary time – not just in Switzerland, but around the world.

2020-04-30;Swiss health authorities unveil new campaign to tackle coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/stay-healthy_swiss-health-authorities-unveil-new-campaign-to-tackle-coronavirus/45728310; Switzerland has tweaked its health guidelines to counter the spread of the coronavirus, as the country gradually returns to work and school. Still in place are recommendations to wash hands frequently and thoroughly, skip handshakes, and cough or sneeze only into a tissue or the crook of an elbow. In situations where maintaining social distance is not possible, the Federal Office of Public Health recommends the use of protective face masks. It has issued a video on how to handle them correctly. That recommendation was echoed by the Swiss Federal Railways and the Postal Bus service, which jointly unveiled their public transport safety concept on Thursday. They recommend that customers wear face masks if they cannot maintain a distance of two metres on buses, trams and trains. “Travel only when necessary, avoid rush hour, observe distance rules,” said Federal Railways boss Vincent Ducrot during a video media conference. The government also recommends continuing to work from home when possible. Some shops and businesses re-opened on April 27 in a first phase of easing of lockdown measures. Compulsory schools along with all shops, markets and restaurants are set to re-open on May 11. The now pink “Here’s how to protect ourselves” campaign material can be found on the public health office website, www.ofsp-coronavirus.chExternal link. The new campaign coincides with a slight uptick in the number of coronavirus cases registered across Switzerland. Some 180 new cases were reported on Thursday, compared to 140 on Wednesday, 100 on Tuesday and 103 on Monday. The health authorities caution the figures can fluctuate dramatically. On average, there are 345 cases per 100,000 residents, according to the latest official tally. Switzerland has carried out 266,222 tests for the virus as of Thursday, of which 13% came out positive. Geneva, Ticino, Vaud, Basel City and Valais are the worst hit cantons.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-30;Switzerland concludes massive repatriation campaign;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coming-home_switzerland-concludes-massive-repatriation-campaign/45717110;Switzerland’s historic repatriation effort in response to the coronavirus pandemic has drawn to a close with the last set of passengers arriving from West Africa. Helvetic Airways, on behalf of the Swiss foreign ministry, brought home 100 travellers from Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. The plane touched down in Zurich late on Wednesday. Eight crew members – three pilots, four cabin crew and one mechanic – all volunteered to complete the special mission. The flight marks the end of operation #flyinghome, the largest repatriation campaign in Swiss history, which started on March 22 as international travel decreased on account of the Covid-19 virus. The operation repatriated 7,200 people from around the world: nearly 4,100 Swiss nationals and 3,100 nationals from other countries. Two-thirds of the non-Swiss were Europeans. Another 1,500 Swiss nationals returned home on flights organised by other countries. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-30;Covid-19 is both threat and opportunity for Swiss biotech;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/ripple-effects_covid-19-is-both-threat-and-opportunity-for-swiss-biotech/45722074;Although the coronavirus pandemic is the Swiss biotech industry’s time to shine, it has left many smaller firms struggling to survive. The head of the Swiss Biotech Association discusses the sector’s challenges and its work on therapies and vaccines. Michael Altorfer is well-placed to weigh Switzerland’s chances of a breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19. Before becoming the CEO of the Swiss Biotech Association, he spent 20 years working in the biopharmaceutical industry, both with giants Roche and Novartis and smaller biotechs like Polyphor. “Switzerland is well positioned to play a leading role in the response to the coronavirus pandemic,” Altorfer told swissinfo.ch. The biotech industry has long been one of the most dynamic sectors in the Swiss economy with some 1,000 companiesExternal link. But behind the optimism is a risky, albeit rewarding, business proposition that leaves the sector highly exposed during the coronavirus crisis. Altorfer discussed the many factors at play for the industry in an interview with swissinfo.ch. Michael Altorfer (MA): There are at least a dozen biotech companies that are responding to the pandemic. Data is still emerging so it is difficult to judge the efforts at this stage but several have spoken publicly about their work. This includes Memo TherapeuticsExternal link, a spin-off of the Swiss federal institute of technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), that has technology to develop therapeutic candidates derived from antibodies in recovered patients. Zurich-based NeurimmuneExternal link is working on anti-coronavirus antibodies that can be directed to the lungs of infected patients and HumabsExternal link, a Swiss subsidiary of US company Vir Technology, is also isolating antibodies. Molecular PartnersExternal link is taking a different approach, looking at DARPin proteins that block the virus from entering cells. None of these have been tested in the clinic yet but these companies all have experience working on similar projects. On the vaccine side, one interesting effort is led by InnoMedicaExternal link based in Zug and Bern. The company is relying on their liposome technology to develop a vaccine. MA: Some, like Roche, are leading the way in testing for the virus or the immune response. When it comes to vaccines and therapeutics addressing Covid-19, many of the big pharma companies are looking at whether they can repurpose already marketed drugs. If these can help Covid-19 patients, that speeds things up because they’ve already been tested and used on patients. This means that while they still needed to be tested in the context of Covid-19, many questions about potential side-effects have already been addressed. This is for example the case for Roche, which is testing its arthritis drug Actemra, as well as Novartis, which has tests running on the antimalarial hydroxychloroquineExternal link and another drug called Jakavi, that has been used to suppresse immune reaction in severely ill patients. Such repurposing efforts are trying to address symptoms and side effects, not the cause of Covid-19 itself. MA: I start by looking at their end goal. Is it a vaccine? Is it repurposing a drug to address symptoms? All of these efforts are helpful, but they don’t require the same investment and effort. Then, I assess how far away the company is from the end goal. For example, if they are dealing with completely new therapeutics with new chemical entities, that is the furthest away. If they are already in the clinic, it takes less time and even less if the company is focused on repurposing drugs. MA: Even the optimists say it will take a year and half before a Covid-19 vaccine is ready. US company Moderna Therapeutics’ work on a vaccine is the one I hear about the most. They expect something available early next year. In Switzerland, a research group at the University of BernExternal link has announced an even more aggressive timeline. In normal times, if you start from scratch with a novel type of compound to address an unmet medical need, it usually takes 10 to 15 years before it is on the market. Even then, the success rate for projects that start in the research phase is only 1 out of 100. That means only 1% will make it to the market. Even if you enter the clinic after five or six years, you still only have about a 1 out of 10 chance of making it. MA: The strengths of the Swiss biotech industry will not disappear because of the coronavirus crisis. However, it faces a lot of uncertainty because of the delays that are simply an unavoidable side effect of the pandemic. Many companies are in the middle of a financing round and are fighting to survive. Investors will need to be patient and forgiving. It is almost impossible to launch clinical trials right now that provide investors with the data they need. Many companies have had to abort animal testing because facilities aren’t running the way they used to. With universities closed, many research partnerships are also on hold. This means that companies are burning through money every day and not getting a step closer to the next financing round. It is not just lost time. In some cases, companies will have to redo all of the testing because there is a risk that a patient gets infected with Covid-19 and has to drop out of the trial. This is especially worrying for the 60-70% of biotech companies in the country that are in limbo – meaning they are neither a start-up nor are they generating revenue. These companies are particularly exposed and don’t have access to the federal emergency loansExternal link. While some cantons have promised some complementary support measures, it isn’t clear what these will look like. Most likely these will be nowhere near the amount these companies require as some spend half a million to 5 million francs per month and with virtually no income. It isn’t just jobs in companies that are at risk. But some two-thirds of financing goes to third-party providers such as research partners. MA: I do. I don't know how sustainable it's going to be though. MA: I think there has been clear recognition, particularly in Europe and the US of the co-dependency in supply chains on China and India. In antibioticsExternal link, we are almost 100% dependent on these countries. Many countries realise how vulnerable they have become by saving a few bucks and producing such compounds somewhere in the world. I also think there will certainly be more people that are open minded to higher pricing in this field. If you look back 10-15 years ago, antibiotics in some countries were 10-15% of total drug expenditures. Now, they don’t even show up on the graph because it is such a small portion. It is important that we continue to get a price for these products so that companies that are successful in bringing the 1% of research projects to the market can pay for all the failed projects and they continue to attract investors. I also think this pandemic is going to change the public discourse around difficult questions such as about how much a life is worth or what we’ll pay to extend a life by a couple of months. Do you use the full treatment option on somebody that is 100 years old or not? Ultimately what is doable is not necessarily what we can afford to do. These questions are not for the industry to decide but the public discourse needs to answer them. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-30;Covid 19: Switzerland earmarks CHF400 million for international aid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/global-solidarity_covid-19--switzerland-earmarks-chf400-million-for-international-aid/45727146;The Swiss government has announced it plans to commit CHF400 million ($410 million) in aid money to mitigate the consequences of Covid-19 in developing countries.  Half of that amount would be granted as an interest-free loan to the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for work it is carrying out in over 80 countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) would receive a loan of CHF25 million for its disaster fund.   The loans are to be approved by parliament in June.  The remaining CHF175 million will be provided to various international organisations active in the fight against Covid-19 in developing countries.   “A global crisis requires a global response,” Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told the media on Thursday. Although Switzerland needed to take care of its own citizens in this difficult situation, “it is necessary to show solidarity with people in other countries, especially in poor countries”, he added.  The situation in these countries could become even more precarious as a result of the pandemic, Cassis said. Because of lockdown measures, many people are unable to work and feed their families, nor do they have access to social welfare assistance.  This aid commitment follows a request from the foreign affairs committee of the House of Representatives for an increase of CHF100 million to the international aid purse. Cassis emphasised that Switzerland had already provided assistance to countries affected by the novel coronavirus. For example, the Alpine nation had sent technical equipment to China before the pandemic hit Europe.  The Swiss Development Agency has adjusted its ongoing aid programmes to respond to the crisis and delivered relief supplies to affected countries that had requested them, including Nepal, Greece and Serbia.

2020-04-30;Who foots the bill for the Swiss coronavirus relief package?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/financial-impact-of-covid-19_who-foots-the-bill-for-the-coronavirus-relief-package-/45721512;Funds for an unemployment scheme, loans for cash-strapped companies, financial aid for culture and sport, money to buy hygienic masks – to name just a few new expenses. The coronavirus pandemic is causing considerable costs for the Swiss government. On top of the Covid-19 related expenditure, the finance ministry is also bracing itself for lower revenue this year, notably from value added tax, withholding tax and direct federal tax. Despite considerable uncertainties, Switzerland is well positioned to cope with the financial impact of the crisis. So far, the different government ministries have earmarked more than CHF65 billion ($66.8 billion) to cope with the impact of the pandemic according to the Federal Finance AdministrationExternal link. Part of the funds are loans to be refunded. Finance Minister Ueli Maurer last week estimated that the Swiss government would provide between CHF70 billion and CHF80 billion in financial aid. In addition, the country’s 26 cantons and local authorities will contribute to the relief efforts. The figure is comparable to the CHF68 billion the government forked out to rescue the leading bank UBS when it was struggling in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Another figure might give some more context: Last year, Switzerland Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – a key economic indicator – was CHF698.6 billion. Experts from the economics ministry forecast that the GDP will plunge by nearly 7% this year. Despite the so-called debt brake mechanism – capping expenditures  – it is possible to spend the necessary funds. The relatively low debt level and the favourable financial situation give Switzerland enough leeway to run into higher debts, according to the Federal Finance Administration. For one: plenty of money is currently available, or as experts put it: there is high liquidity. But the government can also borrow money from other sources, notably the financial market. This in turn comes at a price – namely debts. An accurate figure will only be available at the end of the year. It is safe to say one thing at this stage, according to the Federal Finance Administration. Debt will increase. Yet it is not possible to give a precise figure as the situation is extremely volatile. Finance Minister Maurer recently estimated that the federal accounts could drop into the red this year with a deficit of between CHF30 billion and CHF40 billion. This compares to several years with a surplus. Parliament is the supreme authority on matters of the national budget. Therefore, it has to approve all additional expenditures. Voters only have the final say in the case of a proposed change in the constitution, and if a legal amendment is challenged to a referendum. At the moment there are no plans to raise taxes, according to federal tax authorities. The 26 cantons of the country set their own tax levels.  The role of the Swiss National Bank is not to print money on behalf of the government. The bank is independent, and its policy – defined by law – is aimed at ensuring price stability. Because of a deal with the finance ministryExternal link, the central bank distributes some of its surplus among the federal authorities and cantons.

2020-04-29;Swiss direct democracy to resume in September with packed agenda;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-thaw-_swiss-direct-democracy-to-resume-in-september-with-packed-agenda/45726092;After the cancellation of the May 17 votes due to Covid-19, citizens will be asked to vote on five separate subjects on September 27.  On Wednesday, the Swiss government finalised the subjects for the first nationwide vote since the start of the coronavirus crisis. In addition to a vote on the European Union freedom of movement agreement, the Hunting Act amendments and tax deductions for childcare costs (all carried over from the cancelled vote of May 17) citizens will decide on the issues of paternity leave and the purchase of fighter aircraft.  “The government is aware that the voting menu is extensive, but it considers it acceptable,” Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr told the press. The Swiss have voted a dozen times on five different items at the same time, and the number even rose to nine in 2003, he said.   The most contentious subject is likely to be the vote on the free movement of people. The initiative, which reflects worries among some Swiss about immigration in general, demands that the government scrap the freedom of movement agreement with the EU within a year.  If the initiative were accepted by voters, the text states that Swiss authorities would have just one year to negotiate the end of the existing free movement agreement with Brussels. If no solution is found, the government should end the agreement within a month, which could risk the collapse of other bilateral agreements with the 27-nation bloc.  The people will also decide on September 27 on a two-week paternity leave proposal. It is expected to cost CHF230 million per year and would require an increase in employee contributions.   The Swiss will also vote on increasing tax deductions for parents. The referendum was launched in opposition to parliament’s decision to increase the general deduction for parents from CHF6,500 to CHF10,000 on taxable income. This comes on top of an undisputed increase in the federal deduction for third-party childcare costs from CHF10,100 to CHF25,000.   The Swiss will also vote on whether or not the army should acquire new fighter aircraft for CHF6 billion. In 2014, the army’s plan to procure 22 Swedish Gripen jets was rejected by 53.4% of voters.   Nature conservation organisations, for their part, are contesting the revision of the Hunting Act, which aims to regulate certain species and prevent damage or a danger to humans. The reform permits targeted individual shooting and provides for a transfer of powers from the federal government to the country’s 26 cantons.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-29;Swiss government approves further easing of coronavirus restrictions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/may-11_swiss-government-approves-further-easing-of-coronavirus-restrictions/45725102;Restaurants and culture institutions can re-open under strict conditions and schools can resume classes as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions from May 11.  The loosening of regulations announced on Wednesday by the government follow an eight-week lockdown to stem the Covid-19 virus from spreading in the country. Restaurants are only allowed to serve tables with a maximum of four seated guests and the tables have to be at least two metres apart.  However, a ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people remains in place and the government urged people to continue to heed hygiene standards, notably social distancing and handwashing. Major events involving more than 1,000 people – notably cultural festivals – will not be allowed until at least the end of August. “Our decision is based on a pragmatic, step-by-step approach,” President Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference on Wednesday. “It is another step in our strategy, which seeks to avoid giving in to extreme demands,” she added. The government has come under pressure, notably from certain industry sectors and right-wing and centre-right political parties, to speed up the easing of measures. Sommaruga said Switzerland had to learn to cope with the virus. “It will take time before a vaccine or medication is available,” she said. Echoing her statement, Interior Minister Alain Berset warned the population against complacency. He said every further easing depended on the development of the health situation, including the number of new infections and hospitalisations over the next weeks. Berset admitted it was difficult for the government to regulate the precise details of the re-opening policy. He also said the cantons would be given back their wide-ranging autonomy on education affairs. As part of the strategy, classes for children up to the age of 16 will resume in mid-May, including music schools. High schools can offer classes for small groups of students. Museums, libraries and archives can also re-open, while public transport will begin regular services, provided they put in place a safety concept which may include a recommendation for passengers to wear masks. It was already announced that non-essential shops will re-open on May 11. The cantonal health authorities also plan to resume the contact-tracing of Covid-19 infections as of mid-May. “This is a new dawn for the Swiss economy,” said Economics Minister Guy Parmelin. “But there are still plenty of dark clouds on the horizon.” He referred to the high number of requests for short-time working compensation, rising unemployment and a looming recession. “The government is counting on the sense of responsibility of companies and individuals with its strategy of a gradual resumption of business activities under safety concepts,” he said. On Monday, a first phase of the exit strategy came into effect, allowing hairdressers, physiotherapists, dentists, garden centres and florists to resume business. At the end of May, the government will decide whether to ease a ban on gatherings of more than five people, the re-opening of universities and other institutes of higher education, as well as sports competitions with spectators, religious services and tourist transport facilities in the mountains.

2020-04-29;Switzerland to relax certain entry restrictions from May 11;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/family-and-jobs-_switzerland-to-relax-certain-entry-restrictions-from-may-11/45725666;The backlog of applications made by non-Swiss citizens to work or rejoin family in Switzerland will be processed from this date, the government announced on Wednesday.  The plans will gradually ease the restrictions on entry into the country that were put in place in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.   Applications to work in Switzerland submitted before March 25 by citizens of the EU or EFTA Member States will be processed as of May 11. Family reunification will again be possible for family members of Swiss citizens as well as kin of EU or EFTA nationals living in Switzerland.  Workers from third countries (non-EU or EFTA) who already have a permit to work in Switzerland but were unable to obtain a visa because of entry restrictions will be able to enter the country. Applications for employment of third-country nationals submitted before March 19 will also be processed.  Cross-border work permits will be processed if they are based on a contract concluded in writing before March 25. For example, a fitter from Germany will be able to install a machine that has already been ordered by a Swiss company.  Border controls will not be lifted, however. Additional border posts may be opened to avoid excessive waiting times. Travellers on flights from abroad will only be able to enter Switzerland at the airports of Zurich, Geneva and Basel.  The government wants to minimise the negative effects of border restrictions on the Swiss economy, it said. The measures will be taken in close consultation with neighbouring countries.  All other entry and immigration restrictions will remain in force until further notice. However, the government has already decided on the next step. From June 8 onwards, all applications from nationals of EU or EFTA member states who are gainfully employed and actually able to work in Switzerland will be processed.   This second stage will be carried out in consultation with the cantons and the trade unions. It will be accompanied by the reactivation of the obligation to advertise vacancies at local unemployment offices.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-29;Finance minister eyes central bank surplus to reduce expected debts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-debt_finance-minister-eyes-central-bank-surplus-to-reduce-expected-debts/45724550;Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer wants the country’s central bank to contribute to the reduction of the debt caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “I suggest the Swiss National Bank spends the money from an annual surplus to reduce coronavirus-related debts,” he told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday. The central bank made a surplus of CHF48.9 billion ($50.2 billion) last year. Under a deal with the finance ministry, the bank paid CHF4 billion to the national government and the 26 cantons. New debt is likely to increase in the current year to between CHF30 billion and CHF50 billion, Maurer said recently. He added that it won’t be possible to reduce debts quickly without implementing drastic spending cuts over the next few years, despite a debt reduction mechanism, known as debt brake. Maurer said the sale of mobile phone licences could also generate a few a hundred million francs in revenue. The Swiss government has revised its economic forecast because of the coronavirus pandemic. Predictions have recently been revised sharply downwards and the government expects the worst recession in 45 years. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Studies on alcohol consumption in times of crisis show a decline in alcohol consumption among moderate drinkers.   However, on Wednesday, the organisation warned that the Covid-19 crisis can aggravate alcohol problems in people who already drink heavily. Vulnerable groups include people with few social or financial resources, those who use alcohol as a self-medication to relieve stress (such as medical staff) or those who are confronted with a less structured daily routine or are unemployed.   Addiction Switzerland called for urgent measures to detect and prevent alcohol problems in vulnerable groups in particular at an early stage. Monitoring average alcohol consumption or sales figures is not enough, the charity warned.   Apart from alcohol-related problems, Addiction Switzerland predicts that Covid-19 will most likely lead to long-lasting psychological problems such as sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress and depression in many people.    This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

At its peak – also in calendar week 14 – twice as many people aged over 65 died there as would have been statistically expected. As this region has a larger population than Ticino, the Lake Geneva region has been the most affected by excess mortality in absolute terms.  The other greater regions noted excess mortality – to a lesser extent – in week 13 (northwest Switzerland), week 14 (Neuchâtel, Fribourg, Bern, Solothurn, Zurich and eastern Switzerland) and week 16 (central Switzerland).  As of April 28, more than 1,600 people have died from Covid-19 in Switzerland and some 29,000 have tested positive.

However, the processions will not be publicised so as not to attract tourists and spectators.  From the beginning of May to mid-June, farmers march hundreds of thousands of cows from their valley farms to mountain meadows – and then back them down again in early autumn. The descent in particular is a big event, with the cows wearing floral crowns and led through town by yodelling farmers, who are also dressed up in traditional attire.  This year the drives up the alp are to be made “corona-compliant”, the two Appenzell cantons said on Tuesday in a joint media statementExternal link.  “The current regulations and the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) for the containment of coronavirus must be complied with,” they said.  “In contrast to the drives coming down the alp, which are advertised as tourist events, there are hardly any spectators on the way up. Furthermore, neither tourist organisations nor alpine farmers are allowed to make the dates of the alpine drives public this year.”  The cantons pointed out that it was forbidden for groups of more than five people to meet not only along roads but also on farms or up mountains.  Alpine farmers and their assistants will also have to comply with the FOPH’s regulations and recommendations to contain coronavirus during the drives up the alp.  As a guide on how to deal with this special situation, the agricultural offices of cantons Appenzell Inner Rhodes and Appenzell Outer Rhodes have prepared a leaflet which will be sent to all alpine farmers in the next few days.  The leaflet contains, above all, instructions on the rules of keeping distance, hygiene regulations and how people should act who are ill, feel ill or are particularly at risk.

2020-04-28;Stockpiling – a Swiss civic duty;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/emergency-supplies_stockpiling---a-swiss-civic-duty/45721424;During the coronavirus pandemic, panic buying has not been too problematic in Switzerland. But in previous global crises the Swiss tended to rush to the shops to stock up. Encouraged by the authorities, keeping emergency supplies remains a well-ingrained tradition for Swiss citizens.  A week after the First World War broke out, rice, coffee and tinned food disappeared from shelves of Swiss shops, forcing the government to impose food rationing. But the problem persisted, because as soon as products were made available, people tended to buy more than they needed.  At the time, hoarding was sometimes criticised publicly as anti-social behaviour. In 1941 – during the Second World War – Swiss students held demonstrations with banners stating: “Hoarding is a betrayal of the homeland”. But panic buying continued, albeit at a smaller scale owing to the rationing. After 1945, the Federal Council (executive body) tried to further tighten state controls. The newly founded Federal Office for Civil Protection recommended each household maintain an emergency stockpile consisting of two kilogrammes of sugar, 2kg of rice, one litre of oil and 1kg of fat, which could be supplemented with pasta, flour and tinned food. The supplies had to last for two months.  During the Cold War, emergency stocks were intended to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. At the beginning of the 1950s, such stockpiles were not particularly well received by the public. But after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, the importance of stockpiles gained favour. Adverts appeared in cinemas, at exhibitions and trade fairs to encourage people to build stockpiles, and students were taught the importance of emergency provisions. “The aim of these campaigns was to embed the Cold War threat into the everyday lives of the Swiss. This was part of the intellectual defence of the nation aimed at reinforcing national identity and the norms and values that were thought to be Swiss,” declared historian Sibylle Marti, a specialist in the theme of stockpiling.  At the time, women were unable to vote or serve in the military. But they were still being mobilized. A 1960 brochure for emergency stockpiling showed a soldier looking after his gun, and a housewife building up emergency stocks, said Marti. Such campaigns tended to reinforce traditional roles but they also employed modern advertising techniques. A poem competition organised by the Swiss authorities to popularise stockpiling resulted in tens of thousands of entries.  “In the 1960s American lifestyles became better known in Switzerland, opening up new possibilities for women in terms of consumption, free time and employment,” said Marti. “The idea of emergency provisions became disassociated from war and was linked instead to modern, practical lifestyles. They were viewed as a way of helping out housewives.” The Swiss authorities, nonetheless, maintained their overall strategy towards emergency stocks. In 1988, as the Cold War came to an end, the Swiss government launched a televised appeal for the population to build up emergency stocks. And after 9/11 attacks and US intervention in Afghanistan, the government reaffirmedExternal link the importance and relevance of emergency stockpiles. Special campaigns may be a thing of the past, but on their website the Federal Office for National Economic SupplyExternal link still encourages households to keep enough supplies for about a week.

2020-04-28;How world leaders and citizens are handling coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemics-and-power_how-world-leaders-and-citizens-are-handling-coronavirus/45713680;Who would want to be a leader during a pandemic? Faced with making decisions that should save lives, but might also cause devastating economic damage? Telling citizens they must not do their favourite things, like going out for dinner, away for a weekend, having a beer with a few friends?   No politician wants to be the bringer of bad news, so it’s been interesting to observe how different leaders have risen to their pandemic responsibilities, how they have coped with decisions most of them probably never, even in their worst nightmares, imagined they would have to make. US President Donald Trump famously suggested he had “total authority”, thereby dismissing more than two centuries of US constitutional practice, along with 50 states, and their governors. Emmanuel Macron of France used his undisputed presidential powers to impose a strict lockdown, but has at the same time argued for global solidarity, and suggested the pandemic required a rethink of capitalism.   Meanwhile here in Switzerland our low key seven member government assumed emergency powers quickly, but with a certain air of reluctance. In fact it has been rather refreshing to hear Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga suggest the government does not want these powers for too long, wants parliament back in session soon, and in the meantime is grateful for the searching questions of journalists at the daily pandemic press briefings.   Equally interesting has been our own reaction to our politicians. The enforced restrictions placed on our lives might have been expected to cause a howl of protest. In fact, there was scarcely even a whimper. When your government tells you “our backs are to the wall”, as Swiss health minister Alain Berset did, you take it seriously.   Across the border in France, I have friends who have an instinctive skepticism of governments. Yet they have accepted Macron’s lockdown meekly, some even suggesting the measures should be even stricter. In the UK, colleagues who are most definitely not natural Tories told me they thought Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s address to the nation, watched by 28 million people, was a fine thing. Our need to have faith in our governments right now is understandable.  We all know there will be many investigations over how different countries, and indeed the World Health Organization, handled this pandemic. Nevertheless human rights organisations warn that a crisis should not be a reason to give our leaders carte blanche to do whatever they like.   “We rightfully look to governments to protect us,” says Ken Roth, who is Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. “International human rights law contemplates governments taking additional powers in times of crisis, so long as those powers are necessary and proportionate.”   “But we are seeing governments going beyond what is necessary.” Roth cites Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban’s assumption of emergency powers, in which he has granted himself the right to rule by decree indefinitely. Over in the Philippines, President Duterte, warning people against breaking the curfew, has said police will be allowed to “shoot them dead.”   For some leaders, Roth warns, the pandemic is not a public health crisis, but “an opportunity to enhance their power, to silence their critics, to pursue their own political interests rather than the health of the public”.   Human rights groups say there are precedents for this that we should learn from.   “I sadly see many parallels between the coronavirus pandemic and the terrorist attacks of September 2001,” says Roth. “In each case people were afraid, and they asked their governments to protect them. In each case governments overreached, and it was very difficult to roll back that overreach.”   “So in the United States, we still have Guantanamo Bay. We still have targeted killings by drones, and we still have a huge surveillance programme that was introduced after 9/11 and only marginally cutback.”   Roth believes all of us need to keep an eye on our governments. “The burden is really on us as citizens to scrutinize what governments are doing, and to ensure that they really do only what is necessary to protect public health.”   Meanwhile, as we try to cope with lockdown, stay safe, work from home or even hang on to our jobs, our focus naturally becomes more insular, and less international. Our borders are closed, and we are less interested in what happens outside them.   But United Nations aid agencies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, still have work to do among some of the most vulnerable groups on the planet, now at even greater risk because of the pandemic.   How do you “social distance” in a refugee camp? Some of the camps, the UN Refugee Agency has warned, have little water, let alone soap. The prolonged hand washing we are all faithfully doing is impossible.   In some of the detention centres visited by the ICRC, detainees have so little room that they cannot even lie down to sleep. Keeping a two-metre distance from others is unimaginable.   Such groups, UN Human Rights has warned, are “disproportionately affected by the virus, because of their precarious conditions of existence, and should not be victimized further because of state of emergency measures”.   In the Philippines, in Bangladesh, in Syria, the ICRC and aid agencies are supplying refugee camps and detention centres with clean water, personal protective equipment, and sterilising hand wash. When we honour our hard-working health professionals, as we are doing so often these days, we should not forget the humanitarian aid agencies who are working hard to protect the most vulnerable in some of the world’s poorest countries.   There will be, though it might not seem so now, a time after this pandemic. We all want to get back to normal as soon as possible. But, we are beginning to realise, it will be a “new normal”. Things won’t be exactly the same. Here again human rights groups have concerns.   We know governments want us to sign up to some form of tracking system, in order to trace disease outbreaks and shut them down before they become so widespread that we have to shut our entire economies down instead. “I think it is very concerning because we are racing into embracing a new technology without really having adequate governance and policies and understanding of what it is that we are putting in place,” says Meg Davis, a specialist in human rights and global health at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.   Davis points out that the tracking systems used in Singapore and South Korea, and now being examined for possible adoption by European countries, had data protection problems.    “Even where the data was anonymised, it was sometimes possible for people to figure out who the {infected} person was, which then exposes them to risk.”   “And we don’t fully understand yet what the role is of the tech giants who are going to be capturing this data. Who owns the data, who can sell it, which laws govern it?”   Already, there are warning signs that Europe’s plans for a tracking system will be problematic. Swiss technology experts who had been participating in a pan European project aimed at developing a tracing App for smartphones have pulled out, saying the blueprint did not offer enough privacy protection.   Clearly, there are difficult days, weeks and months ahead. It’s understandable that our focus is on the immediate difficulties at home. But if we are to emerge from this crisis in the spirit of solidarity that the World Health Organization has so often called for during the pandemic, then the concerns of human rights groups must not be forgotten.    The refugees, the displaced, the detainees, deserve protection too. And as for our governments, as one WHO official put it, they are not “taking power”. Rather, we as citizens are “gifting it to them”, and that gift is temporary.  You can follow Imogen Foulkes on twitter at @imogenfoulkes, and send her questions and suggestions for UN topics.

2020-04-28;Annual report;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/2019---20-years-online-media-_annual-report-swi-swissinfo-ch/45710832;"On 12 March 2019, SWI swissinfo.ch celebrated its 20th anniversary. This provided us with the opportunity to reflect on our eventful history as a purely online news organisation, and to look at the state of the media globally. To this end we hosted an event with journalists from all over the world co-organised by the Swiss branch of Reporters Without Borders. SWI swissinfo.ch, throughout its 20-year history, has had a unique and even unconventional role within the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC). SWI swissinfo.ch is a comparatively small unit of the SBC (around 100 employees) yet, unlike other units, provides content in several languages (ten) and meets the complex challenge of reflecting world news from a Swiss perspective and explaining Switzerland to the world. Those who love us understand Switzerland; that is our vision. The question of how we, as a Swiss media organisation with an international mandate, can offer global audiences relevant, compelling content has been a key issue for us, especially on the occasion of our anniversary. The sharp rise in the use of our website from a monthly average of 1,049,111 to 1,236,658 unique clients in 2019 showed once again the strong demand for independent journalism from Switzerland’s public broadcaster. Global crises such as the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic make it clear how fertile the breeding ground is for fake news in uncertain times, and therefore how urgent the need is for trusted reporting from the public media, including Switzerland’s international service. With ten languages we make our contribution, potentially reaching around 75% of the world's population.    SWI swissinfo.ch reflects developments throughout Switzerland’s history – from the country’s birth in the Middle Ages to the players and events shaping Switzerland today, whether in the field of politics, economics, science, culture or education. This Swiss content is contextualised for foreign audiences and made available exclusively in the languages not served by the domestic units of the SBC. Placing Swiss political, societal and cultural developments in a global context, shedding light on efforts of Swiss businesses to leave their mark internationally, and underscoring scientific achievements that move and change the world – all of this is at the heart of what SWI swissinfo.ch does, as well as spotlighting the specific characteristics of Switzerland and the country’s values. Another important part of our mission is to enable people to form their own opinions, especially in parts of the world where an independent media is suppressed. Independent, trusted journalism was therefore the focus of our 20th anniversary event. The need for independent journalism is arguably greater today than ever before. This was borne out by the stories on international crises and conflicts that drove much of our readership in 2019. In order to further sharpen our international focus, the Editorial Board prioritised reporting in 2019 on developments out of ‘International Geneva’. To this end, a new podcast, Inside Geneva, was conceived. Our global readership, in particular Swiss citizens living abroad, also closely followed our coverage of the biggest domestic story of the year – the 2019 federal elections, thanks to our in-depth reports. In order to keep pace with an ever-changing digital media landscape, we have worked hard to upgrade our content management system (CMS). This upgrade has been essential for a relaunch of the SWI swissinfo.ch website, planned for 2020. The new design is intended to further strengthen our editorial strategy and usability, especially for our international audiences in all ten languages. Driving these changes is our commitment to high-quality content and independent reporting. With this in mind, the Editorial Board has reviewed and updated SWI swissinfo.ch’s quality management standards. In 2019, the editorial guidelines and principles were revised and in the spirit of transparency, made available to the public. The manual(PDF) also includes guidelines on storytelling, formats and use of multimedia. The Editorial Board also refined the ‘four-pillar’ approach it introduced in 2018: Swiss news coverage through the English-service news desk; common content generated by the Production Desk; ‘beat’ or specialised reporting; and country-specific reporting in the non-Swiss languages. And finally, during the anniversary year, we took a long look back at the very beginnings of SWI swissinfo.ch when, in 1935, it came into being as the Swiss Shortwave Service. Where do we stand more than eight decades later? We remain a window on Switzerland - today in ten languages. We still stand for the values of freedom, the rule of law, equality, respect and justice. We analyse global developments and conflicts from a unique Swiss perspective. This is all part of our mission. Thanks to our independence, we also enjoy a high degree of credibility internationally as part of the Swiss public media. We are convinced this is of great value in today’s world. In 2020 we want to continue to matter to our global readership and networks: to exchange opinions, reflect, discuss and provide a better understanding of Switzerland. Switzerland has arguably long been one of the world’s most globalised countries. As a nation with four language regions, balancing interests and diverse cultural demands is part of Switzerland’s DNA. Dear readers, dear interested parties all over the world, we thank you sincerely for your loyalty and the trust you place in us every day. Your SWI swissinfo.ch management teamLarissa M.

2020-04-28;Novartis CEO warns that data on Covid-19 drugs is missing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/testing-_novartis-ceo-warns-that-data-on-covid-19-drugs-is-missing/45721238;Potential pharmaceutical solutions to combat Covid-19 must have strong clinical data to back their efficacy, according to Novartis boss Vasant Narasimhan.  Clinical studies that are properly conducted are necessary to really determine the benefit of drugs, Narasimhan told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday. Only a few drugs had met the standards so far, he said.   The Swiss pharmaceutical company has initiated a clinical study with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Last month he told the Swiss media that pre-clinical studies in animals as well as the first data from clinical studies showed that hydroxychloroquine kills the coronavirus. While the therapy is not yet available, Narasimhan hinted that the first study results could be available in summer.  The Basel-based company also announced its first quarter results on Tuesday, reporting a 11% increase in net sales and a turnover of $12.28 billion (CHF12 billion). Novartis says it has managed to weather the coronavirus storm to keep production facilities going.  “Our operations and product demand remain very stable and strong. Mitigating actions helped to ensure minimal disruption to supply chain and ability to meet forward purchasing demand,” according to a company statement.   Forward purchasing and lower spending meant that Novartis made an extra $400 million due to the coronavirus pandemic in the first quarter. However, it is likely that these gains will be reversed over the remainder of 2020, the company cautioned.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-28;Presenting Switzerland’s new look;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/easing-of-lockdown-measures_presenting-switzerland-s-new-look/45719282;Off to the hairdresser, the florist or the DIY superstore: Monday was the first day that people in Switzerland slowly began emerging from the coronavirus lockdown. Masks remain an omnipresent reminder of the danger. After five weeks of the semi-lockdown measures ordered by the Swiss government, the population can resume a few activities that had been forbidden. You don't need to be a psychic to predict that hair salons will be very busy in the next days, either taming outgrown manes or trying to fix botched attempts to cut and colour at home. People can also visit cosmetic and nail studios, as well as DIY and garden centres. At the same time, doctors, dentists and physiotherapists can open their doors for non-urgent appointments. Hospitals can carry out the procedures that had to be postponed on account of Covid-19. But social distancing and hygiene rules for stopping the spread of the virus are still in effect, and groups should still be limited to five people. In general, people are not required to wear masks. But stores need to uphold strict hygiene rules while ensuring that there is enough distance between customers. Schools and other shops are expected to open in two weeks. If there is not a clear increase in the number of infections, upper secondary and vocational schools, plus universities and other higher education institutions, should be able to re-open on June 8, along with museums, libraries and zoos.

2020-04-27;Expert slams Swiss prosecutor and criminal court;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-football-trial_expert-slams-swiss-prosecutor-and-criminal-court/45719974;Switzerland’s attorney general is facing renewed calls to resign over accusations that his office botched up a high-profile international football trial. The criticism against Michael Lauber comes as a five-year statute of limitations to secure convictions against former officials of the German Football Association and a former Swiss official of the Zurich-based world football governing body (FIFA) expired on Monday. The four suspects allegedly misled the authorities about a CHF10 million ($10.3 million) payment linked to the 2006 World Cup hosted by Germany. The four men denied any wrongdoing and Lauber has defended the handling of the case, which was suspended by the Federal Criminal Court last month amid government instructions for people older than 65 to avoid contact following the coronavirus outbreak. In an interview with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Monday, renowned law professor and anti-corruption campaigner Mark Pieth described the outcome as a setback for the criminal justice system which “could damage Switzerland’s reputation”. Pieth said Lauber should not be allowed to “sit out” the current four-year term of office. Last September, parliament re-elected Lauber for a third term following months of controversy over his handling of an investigation into corruption in world football. The attorney general’s office told the Reuters news agency that it regretted that the “no judicial assessment cold be made” in the case of the four football officials. The Swiss court said the trial had not officially ended and judges would have to rule on the next steps.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-27;Switzerland’s Crypto Valley not quite on its deathbed;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-s-crypto-valley-not-quite-on-its-deathbed/45719750;“The report of my death was an exaggeration.” That was the reputed response of Mark Twain on hearing that a newspaper had mistakenly printed his obituary. Are reports of the imminent demise of Switzerland’s blockchain sector also overblown? Nearly 80% of 203 firms responding to a Swiss Blockchain Federation surveyExternal link have warned of imminent bankruptcy. That would carve a huge hole in the 800+ firms and 4,000 employees that reports say make up the Swiss blockchain sector. This seems to fly in the face of numerous reports of growth and innovation, such as Crypto Finance’s $14.5 million fresh funding, the impending funding round of Bitcoin Suisse, Mt Pelerin and ID Quantique successfully testing a quantum technology crypto storage safe or AlgoTrader launching its digital assets trading platform WIRESWARM. Nym Technologies has unveiled an “NSA snoop-proof” decentralised platform to build applications in privacy. The SIBEX peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform appears to be building up a head of steam, Gentwo’s business of securitization of digital assets is expanding whilst the “decentralised” Tomahawk venture capital fund has just launched in Switzerland. Blockchain start-ups are facing the same pandemic problems all young firms. Companies only qualify for a CHF42 billion state bailout scheme if they have generated revenues, although an extra CHF154 million has been made available in federal and cantonal funds for start-ups. There’s even talk of a CHF100 million public-private venture fund being set up to invest in blockchain start-ups in Zug – a sign of just how much the canton has invested its hopes into the industry. Talk of Crypto Valley turning into “Death Valley” is premature, says German Ramirez, co-founder of marketing firm Relevance House. “It’s normal that 80% of start-ups fail in any industry. That’s not particularly connected to coronavirus. It’s part of the game that entrepreneurs should be aware of before they even start.” Ramirez says the pipeline of new projects is slowing along with investor risk appetite. But he is not alone in pointing out that there will be opportunities for new innovations, such as blockchain, with the post-Covid world crying out for digital solutions. Undoubtedly coronavirus will cause pain. Technology start-ups are facing a dearth of venture capital while some collaborative projects with established industries are being suspended or cancelled. The next few months will witness a harsher environment of natural selection. Some start-ups will be plain unlucky, hitting the pandemic just as they were looking for new funding. André Wolke, co-founder of the Validity Labs consultancy firm, says others will fail because they don’t have a solid business model - innovations with no real-life use case or that are too revolutionary for the market. Daniel Haudenschild, president of the Crypto Valley Association, says the sector has developed a hardened garage start-up style mentality after absorbing repeated blows over the years. This includes being frozen out by many banks – an issue when it comes to asking those same banks for emergency loans right now. “People in this space truly believe in what they are doing. If one project fails they will just pick up again with another one. We are not going to see a mass exodus from the ecosystem,” he says. Bailouts are welcome, but hardly fit in with the spirit of decentralisation. “The modus operandi of the crypto scene does not include surviving on states handouts - we are not a state-sponsored industry.” Thomas Meister, general manager of the Trust Square co-working and event space in Zurich, says Covid-19 has “accelerated” the financial pressures start-ups usually face during their first three years of existence. This means entrepreneurs will have to adopt a “different mind-set”, going into semi-hibernation or re-thinking whether their services will still be relevant in the post-pandemic world. But he points out that start-ups are having a rough time of it across all sectors, while some industries, such as sporting or entertainment events, are in a worse state that blockchain. Trust Square itself has at least been thrown one lifeline, as a prominent US tech firm (which cannot yet be named) has recently signed up to occupy significant office space at their new premises.

2020-04-27;Over 50,000 denied entry to Switzerland since borders tightened;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/travel-restrictions_over-50-000-denied-entry-to-switzerland-since-borders-tightened/45719214;Since first restricting border crossings on March 13, Swiss customs officers have turned away some 56,000 people, they said on Sunday. Confirming figures first reported in the Le Matin Dimanche newspaper, the Federal Customs Administration (FCA) also said they have been issuing an average of 150 fines per day to those contravening the new border rules. Such instances include continuing to go cross-border shopping, damaging barriers at the borders, or crossing at unauthorised points. Though they did not give precise numbers on the numbers of fines issued for each infraction, an FCA spokeswoman told the Keystone-SDA agency that the number of fines for having crossed the border to go shopping were much fewer in the southern canton of Ticino – where Italian rules on entry are very strict – compared with the French-bordering canton of Geneva. On March 13, the Swiss government limited land border crossings from Italy, a move it then extended to Germany, France, Austria, Spain, and later the entire Schengen region. Currently, only Swiss citizens, Swiss residents, cross-border workers, and those coming to Switzerland on business can enter the country by land. The FCA says it expects a sharp increase in border traffic from Monday, as the country enters the first stage of its coronavirus exit strategy. In preparation, five border points in canton Geneva, which had been closed so as to funnel traffic through fewer and bigger crossings, were reopened last week.

2020-04-27;Coronavirus exit plans for tourist industry mooted;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-exit-plans-for-tourist-industry-mooted/45719056;Hopes have been raised of a re-opening of tourist facilities, including restaurants, in Switzerland in June as part of the government’s exit strategy from the coronavirus restrictions. President Simonetta Sommaruga said the government would examine options, coordinated with the tourist industry, by mid-May. “There are a number of options. I think it is crucial for the population to know that they can go on holiday in Switzerland,” Sommaruga told public radio SRF following talks with industry representatives on Sunday. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin and Interior Minister Alain Berset also participated in the meeting. All participants agreed that the summer season is crucial for tourism and that solutions have to be found which respect the government’s health safety rules to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic to spread again. Tourism is not only an important economic factor for Switzerland but also has an emotional component. People want to be able to look forward to their next holidays, said Erik Jakob, senior official of the State Secretartiat for Economic Affairs. He warned that the tourist industry can't expect to go back to normal in July or August. International tourists are likely to stay away from Switzerland for a longer period of time, Jakob told a news conference on Monday.  Further talks between the government and tourism representatives are scheduled for the end of May, according to officials. The tourist sector employs more than 180,000 people and accounts for about 3% of GDP.  The government is facing increasing pressure from sections of the business community and from right-wing and centre-right political parties to speed up the end of the lockdown. In a first step, garden centres, florists, hairdressers as well as dentists and physiotherapists have been allowed to re-open on Monday. In a second phase, set for May 11, primary schools and all shops are to reopen – provided the number of infections continue to drop. Other sectors of the economy, including tourism, sport and entertainment, are still waiting to hear how and when they can resume business. More than six weeks ago, the government also introduced a ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people in Switzerland.

2020-04-27;Alternative medicine no longer an ‘outsider’ in Switzerland’s health system;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/going-mainstream_alternative-medicine-no-longer-an--outsider--in-switzerland-s-health-system/45706024;​​​​​​​ Once on the margins of the healthcare system, growing public demand for complementary medicine has led to increased regulation in a bid to eliminate bad apples and improve patient safety. It’s the result of much trial and error.  Even before the coronavirus pandemic became an all-consuming topic, the government of the central Swiss canton of Lucerne was preoccupied with amending its health law. (Health matters fall under the purview of Switzerland’s 26 cantons which often means a lack of uniformity across the country).   In early March, a new draft of Lucerne’s health law was presented with one main objective: introduce work licences for alternative medicine practitioners in the fields of homeopathy, Ayurveda, Chinese Traditional Medicine and European Traditional Medicine.  “These practices pose a certain health risk for the population. With the introduction of the authorisation requirement, the canton Lucerne wants to ensure that only people who meet certain minimum professional skills are active,” Alexander Duss of canton Lucerne’s health department told swissinfo.ch.   But such requirements have been in place before and were then revoked. In 2006, Lucerne decided to do away with previous work licence requirements for alternative health practitioners. At the time there were too many different courses for the authorities to verify the qualifications of professionals, according to Hanspeter Vogler, head of canton Lucerne’s health department.   Ultimately, unable to guarantee uniform quality in the sector, the canton decided to leave it to patients to determine if their choice of a professional for treatment was the right one or not.   Everything changed in 2009 as a result of Switzerland’s direct democracy system. That year, two-thirds of Swiss citizens voted for the inclusion of alternative medicine on the constitutional list of services covered by health insurance. First integrated in 1999 they were struck off the list by the government in 2005 amid rising national health costs using the argument that they failed to meet the criteria of efficacy, cost-effectiveness and suitability.   As a result of the 2009 vote, five alternative therapies – homeopathy, holistic medicine, herbal medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine – were included under the basic health insurance package (compulsory for all Swiss residents) on a trial basis provided they are administered by certified medical doctors. This move brought back alternative medicine into the fold of the mainstream healthcare. Authorities could no longer afford to ignore it now that it once again accounted for a share of national health costs.  So they set about developing standardised national-level examinations – for practitioners who were not doctors – that would lead to a federal diploma. Starting in 2015, naturopaths in the fields of homeopathy, Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional European medicine were able to obtain a diploma that was recognised throughout the country.   “It is always useful to have uniformity as health insurance companies are a bit slow when it comes to reimbursing treatments under the complementary medicine insurance package. They are also under pressure to cut costs,” says Franz Rutz, president of Swiss umbrella association of Ayurveda practitioners.  The introduction of the federal diploma also prompted many cantons – like Lucerne – to introduce or reintroduce work licences for naturopaths. To get one, naturopaths must submit their personal details and a copy of their federal diploma.  Official licensing means that those who get a federal diploma in naturopathy are exempt from paying value-added tax (VAT). They are also automatically included in the National Registry of Healthcare Professions and considered to be healthcare workers: a big leap from being on the fringes.   “With a cantonal work permit we are included in the primary healthcare system, for example now during the Covid-19 crisis we are allowed to continue working,” says Alexandra Nievergelt, co-president of the Swiss Professional Organization for Traditional Chinese Medicine, noting that naturopaths must also adhere to the same rules and restrictions as doctors amid coronavirus.   She says that the work license has also helped allow alternative medicine practitioners to participate in health projects with other medical professionals, something that was not possible earlier.   On the other hand, changing to a cantonal license system raises questions about the fate of those who don’t have a federal diploma and are thus not eligible to obtain a license to practice.   “We welcome a cantonal work permit for the future as it helps to ensure that only qualified practitioners work in our field,” says Nievergelt. “Nonetheless we of course would like to assure that current practitioners are still able to continue working.”  Lucerne has proposed to allow a cushion of five years for practitioners to obtain their federal diploma but some are unhappy about sitting for exams even after acquiring decades of experience in their field. Disagreements over the exam have also led to offshoot groups among practitioners. For example, Ayurveda in Switzerland is now represented by four different associations and two schools because practitioners disagree about the way forward.   But it seems to be too late for those against licensing, as the tide has already turned in favour of standardisation and homegenisation of alternative medicine in Switzerland. Acupuncturists already need a licence in 20 of 26 Swiss cantons and Ayurveda therapists need one in 18 cantons (though most of the French-speaking cantons do not require them).   “It is about having clarity about the quality of practitioners.

2020-04-27;Coronavirus tests Swiss political system;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus-tests-swiss-political-system/45718578;In mid-March, as the first cases of Covid-19 crossed the Alps from Lombardy in nearby Italy, Swiss lawmakers abandoned the spring session of the federal assembly. The doors of the neo-classical parliament building in Bern have been closed since on the advice of the health authorities. On May 4, amid a growing row about the need to keep the country’s democracy functioning, the assembly’s two chambers will reconvene for a four-day emergency session in the less august, but more sanitary, hangers of the Bern expo centre in Wankdorf.  In common with its peers across Europe, Switzerland’s seven-person federal council has enacted sweeping emergency measures to shut down public life across the wealthy alpine federation and halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.  But as the economic effects of the lockdown have begun to bite, fractures have emerged in the political consensus that has underpinned them.  “Of course I understand the decision to suspend [the assembly] in March,” said Felix Uhlmann, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Zurich. “This was a serious crisis and of course there was a lot of pressure for elected members of the assembly to serve as role models. But if you ask me as a lawyer, ‘was it legally correct?’ – I really doubt it.”  Switzerland, with its highly devolved federal system and consultative political culture, offers an extreme example of the extent to which the crisis is straining democratic norms – and raising questions of political legitimacy – as countries across Europe plot their exit strategies. “In many areas – social welfare, court proceedings, political rights – we have a large gap of legitimacy now,” added Uhlmann, who has been commissioned by Switzerland’s Social Democratic Party to provide an expert opinion on a way forward. “If you want to compare the situation, you really have to go back to the Second World War – there hasn’t been a time when the federal council has had so much power since then.” Christoph Blocher, the semi-retired but still totemic billionaire godfather of Swiss rightwing populism – and a former member of the federal council – was characteristically blunt in his assessment of its leadership last week: “It is a dictatorship,” he told viewers of his regular internet show. Polling suggests Blocher’s concern is not shared by most Swiss, but the country is unusual in having so far completely suspended its normal democratic process. In Italy, where the virus first hit Europe, the speaker of the lower house, Roberto Fico, declared early on that parliament would “never close”. In Spain, the congress of deputies must vote to maintain the government’s emergency powers every two weeks. In Germany, the Bundestag has continued its deliberations, albeit with reduced capacity. And in the UK, parliament is meeting in a “hybrid” format, with a reduced number of MPs present in the House of Commons, and others participating digitally.  At the crux of Swiss debate is the challenge to its system of “consensus democracy”. In the Swiss model, the federal council is less a political body set apart from the assembly and more an executive committee of it. The so-called “magic formula” apportions its seven seats to four different factions from the assembly. There is no governing party. It meets in secret, and only takes decisions collectively, but in turn it is rarely supposed to do anything without having first made sure it has a consensus of opinion from both chambers.  Special delegations of the assembly are required to approve certain federal council measures, and “control committees” monitor and check its ordinances in real time, overturning those they believe incompatible with the will of the parliament.  “The whole system lives from the model of checks and balances and wisdom of the crowds, and the idea that all groups can influence government policy, in a constant flow of impulses,” said Lukas Gelder, the co-chief of the political pollster and research institute GFS Bern. “It’s not like in other countries, where there’s a government which has a clear programme and there’s a clear opposition. In Switzerland you need all the elements working together all the time.”  If Bern cannot safely host the assembly in June for its scheduled three week sitting, there may be other options for the assembly to consider. Authorities in Lucerne have offered to host in full compliance with social distancing rules. That raises the possibility of Switzerland temporarily changing its capital city: according to the constitution, there is no permanent capital. It is, instead, wherever the assembly meets. Lucerne was last – briefly – the country’s capital under Napoleon when he invaded in 1798.  Uhlmann believes a digital solution – like that in the UK – could work. “If you look at the way parliamentary practice has developed, ‘present’ means you don’t have to be actually in the room [in the parliamentary building],” he said. “Even if it’s not in the very wording of the constitution, it is clearly in the spirit.” Indeed, the effectiveness of any parliament is as much a matter of its members’ engagement as the principles’ underpinning it – a notion underscored by Zurich’s Tages-Anzeiger newspaper in an article responding to Blocher’s complaint about dictatorship. In the 2012 assembly vote on the epidemic act that underpins the government’s current powers, Blocher – then an elected representative – did not turn up in the chamber to cast his ballot.  Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Masks will be distributed to Swiss supermarket chains Migros and Coop. Migros and Coop will be charging CHF19.7 for a batch of twenty pieces and CHF39.90 for a set of 50 units, according to the report. But not all stores are expected to have masks available on the first day and each customer will only be entitled to one package. Retail stores Manor and Landi are also looking to stock up on textile masks by May 11, which marks the re-opening of compulsory schools. The Swiss government has been remiss to recommend the general use of masks by the population.   + Fraudulent masks offered online “Healthy people still do not need to wear masks in public spaces,” according to the health authorities. The use of masks, however, may be warranted on public transport during rush hour traffic or similar settings in which socially distancing is difficult to maintain. Switzerland has experienced a shortage of protective masks due to the coronavirus crisis. Nonetheless, companies based in the countries exported 25 tonnes of mask in the first months of 2020. This compares to just 13 kg for the whole of 2019, according to reports by Le Matin Dimanche and the SonntagsZeitung, which cited statistics from the customs authority.

The artist Saype, whose real name is Guillaume Legros, has painted his temporary, biodegradable images on lawns from Yamoussoukro in Ivory Coast to the Champ de Mars next to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, often depicting children or a close-up of two people's hands gripping each other's forearms Beyond crisis , his new work on a clearing in the Swiss resort town of Leysin, shows a girl sitting, completing a chain of stick figures holding hands. The fresco of more than 3,000 square metres evokes the building of a world with more solidarity and more humanity, Saype said in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency.External link “There are several levels of reading but the main idea is to challenge the world that will follow after the crisis, on the importance of all looking in the same direction ”, Saype told the Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA. As with my other works, I want to convey an optimistic vision, a certain idea of living together. “Beyond Crisis” was carried out on the private land of a farmer at the Prafandaz pass, which overlooks Lake Geneva. Saype used his usual paint, namely a 100% biodegradable product based ion chalk and charcoal. The lifespan of his work will depend on the weather and the regrowth of the grass.  I estimate it between two weeks to a month, the artists told Keystone-SDA.

2020-04-26;Fears raised over plans to re-open schools amid coronavirus pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education-_fears-raised-over-plans-to-re-open-schools-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/45711646; Switzerland’s compulsory schools are set to re-open next month after a coronavirus lockdown, but not everyone is happy about it. One outstanding question is how to ensure social distancing and adequate hygiene during the school day. “I am looking forward to welcoming the children and seeing how they are. I am interested in seeing how they have coped with these weeks of remote learning,” Alex Messerli, president of the Canton Lucerne Association of Teachers, and himself a primary school teacher, told Swiss public television SRF earlier this week.External link But he also has some reservations. “How many children will come? When will they come? Will they all come together? Where are we going to teach them?” he said. One measure that may be particularly difficult to practise at school is social distancing. Compulsory schoolsExternal link (kindergartens, primary schools and lower secondary schools for pupils aged 12-15) are set to re-open on May 11, almost two months after they were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. + Read our story about how pupils, parents and teachers have been coping with remote learning Higher education establishments, as well as upper secondary and vocational schools should follow on June 8. However, the schedule depends on there being no significant increase in COVID-19 cases, the government has stressedExternal link. A final confirmation is expected on April 29. The government believes that compulsory schools can re-open because children are not the main vectors of Covid-19, basing its decision on input from paediatricians specialising in infectiology. This statement has caused some controversy - see our article below - and opinions remain divided. The government is holding steadfast to its course. “Children can go back to school without taking any risks,” Daniel Koch,  the country’s head of infectious diseases and a leading figure in the pandemic response, reiterated at a press conference on April 22. Like teacher Messerli, the Federation of Swiss Teachers (LCH) has its concerns about re-opening schools. It has called for a national protection concept that includes practical solutions for how pupils and teachers can be kept safe during lessons, breaktimes, bathroom breaks and in post-school childcare settings. Those belonging to risk groups need adequate protection or should be excused from face-to-face teaching, it added in a statement on TuesdayExternal link.  And pupils with special needs need extra support. First indications are that the already existing gap between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils in Switzerland has widened during these weeks of remote learning, the LCH said. + Read more on the subject: what are the long-term effects of school closures? + One fifth of pupils ‘falling through the remote learning net’ The LCH’s French-speaking counterpart, the SER, has been particularly vocal. Guarantees for pupil and teacher safety must be made clear on April 29. “Without them, schools can’t be re-opened,” it said in a statementExternal link. It pointed to an “incoherence” between the abrupt closing of schools to protect pupils during the pandemic and the possible decision to re-open schools “without the scientific elements having really changed”.  “Schools should not be the vector of a new pandemic,” the SER said. While some parents have welcomed the decision to re-open schools after weeks of home office and home schooling, others have not. “Frankly, I am not planning to let my kids go back to school, no matter what Koch says,” tweeted Adriano AguzziExternal link, a prominent professor of neuropathology at the University Hospital of Zurich. There have also been online petitionsExternal link against the re-openings, with resistance particularly strong in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, as SRF has reportedExternal link. However, parents may risk a fineExternal link if they do not send their children without a good reason, as compulsory school is obligatory in Switzerland. For teacher Messerli, children should only go back to school if they can actually have lessons. If the effort of opening schools outweighs the usefulness of doing so, then “we have a question mark here”. The ball is now in the authorities’ court, teachers and parents say.

2020-04-25;Roche boss who says bitter pill of truth is only way to build trust ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pharma_roche-boss-who-says-bitter-pill-of-truth-is-only-way-to-build-trust-/45715996;Severin Schwan talks a lot about trust. Trust in people you live with, socialise with, work with. And trust is not won by being nice, says the chief executive of Roche, one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies.  “There are many components to building trust,” he tells the Financial Times. “One is that you are honest . . . That means sometimes you don’t make friends and . . . sometimes it’s uncomfortable. It’s difficult to tell the truth and to receive the truth.” This week Mr Schwan delivered an uncomfortable truth to the UK government, saying it lagged behind other countries in dealing with the coronavirus crisis because it had not invested enough in healthcare and testing. Speaking from lockdown in Switzerland, Mr Schwan is not apologetic. “I am not saying [the decision not to invest] is right or wrong,” he says. “But don’t wonder [when] a crisis like this comes and you don’t have the infrastructure that you are in a more difficult situation.” Silver haired, but still youthful-looking for his 52 years, Mr Schwan has found himself at the centre of industry efforts to battle the crisis. As one of the world’s leading diagnostics companies, Switzerland-based Roche aims to launch a Covid antibody test next month, while Actemra, an arthritis drug, is also being trialled as a possible treatment.  Amid the global attention, the Roche boss has taken the opportunity to speak his mind, even if it prompts what he calls “a shitstorm”. That was not always the Roche approach, according to one person who knows the company well. “Roche used to be so secretive that you could not get anything from them,” the person says. “But now they are doing things they wouldn’t have done before. There has been a wind of change.” It took time for the winds to shift after Mr Schwan’s appointment as chief executive in 2008 — a surprise nomination given his age, at 40, and background.  With a degree in economics and a doctorate in law, he joined Roche in 1993 as a graduate trainee in the corporate finance team. Mr Schwan worked his way quickly up the ranks, including a stint in Asia, until he became head of Roche’s diagnostics division in 2006. From there he was chosen over the group’s pharmaceuticals boss to take charge.  He was put to the test within a year, when Roche came under attack from some researchers over withholding trial data on its antiviral drug Tamiflu, which had been stockpiled by governments preparing for the swine flu pandemic. The debate spiralled into a public and political controversy as Roche resisted releasing the data.  Roche “did not do themselves any favours”, says another industry veteran. “They did not communicate right.” Mr Schwan admits he could have approached the critics “in a different way, perhaps more proactively”. But he remains adamant that “we were on the right side”.  The patent has expired on Tamiflu, but its value as an efficacious flu treatment continues to be validated by regulators, he says. To question their findings would threaten lives, he insists, even as the world approaches a new flu season that could be made worse by coronavirus. For outsiders that debate was a watershed. “Since then they have become much more open to sharing data and in communications,” the industry veteran says.  Mr Schwan has also developed a reputation for being a solid helmsman, taking revenues from SFr45.6bn in 2008 to SFr61.5bn ($63bn) last year.  In its most recent results, Roche successfully offset the expiry of patents on blockbuster drugs with new treatments for multiple sclerosis and cancer. It has arguably “the most exciting pipeline in pharma”, according to analysts at Jefferies investment bank, and is also building a business in gene therapy.  “Roche is successfully crossing its patent cliff. That’s rather unexpected,” says one pharmaceuticals analyst.  Despite his SFr11m pay packet last year, Mr Schwan remains “a very down-to-earth person” — a product of a Roche culture that abhors flashy wealth, says another pharma veteran. He is “lecturey but not arrogant”. The Roche boss, Austrian by birth, is now a fully fledged member of the Swiss elite. As the lead independent director at Credit Suisse, he helped to steer the bank through the recent crisis which set the board against former chief executive Tidjane Thiam. “He’s very methodical. No bullshit,” says a senior Swiss financier. “With Tidjane, he kept quiet for a long time. And then at a certain point, he thought ‘enough is enough’ and he acted.” He is not without his critics however. “He can be simplistic and naive,” says a former colleague. “At Credit Suisse, his big obsession was purpose, not banking.” The pharma analyst suggests that despite the success of new drugs, “there has not been much transformation at Roche since the acquisition of [biotech group] Genentech”, in 2009. The company is still benefiting from Genentech’s oncology expertise.Mr Schwan agrees that he has profited from decisions made by predecessors. But planning for the very long term is one of the benefits of having the founding Hoffman-Oeri families pooled into a single 45 per cent shareholder, he says.  Mr Schwan is now looking to develop a business focused on personalised healthcare, bringing together digital technologies with the core pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses. That is a longer-term objective, but he says that after 12 years at the helm, he has built the trust with investors and staff to try. “I would be so glad if I am long retired and my successor tells you that back in 2020 they were one of the first companies to figure out how to bring pharmaceutical, diagnostic and digital insights together. That would be a big satisfaction.” Additional reporting by Patrick Jenkins and Stephen Morris in London Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020 This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-25;Swiss researchers join forces to prevent mask shortages;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/remask_-swiss-researchers-join-forces-to-prevent-mask-shortages---------/45715974;Dozens of researchers have joined forces to equip Switzerland with enough masks to confront the coronavirus and future pandemics. During the Covid-19 crisis, protective masks have become a rare commodity in many parts of the world. A national consortium has been set up to work on the “ReMask” project which aims to develop new kinds of protective facial gear and technologies that would allow the reuse of existing masks, according to a Thursday government announcement.External link The consortium is currently developing so-called community masks that meet three key criteria. We are trying to achieve protection against drops, but also against the very fine droplets that are produced when coughing, explains René Rossi, director of the biomimetic membranes and textiles lab at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA).External link “In addition, the mask has to be comfortable enough.   + Protective masks optional for Swiss citizens A central objective of the project is to develop techniques for reusing masks. There are some very good masks which, even if they lost half their effectiveness, would still meet the standards, says Gilles Richner of the Spiez Laboratory, which focuses on the protection of the population against nuclear, biological and chemical threats.  The project also aims to dissuade people from making their own masks: We want to prevent people from making pseudo-masks out of a cotton T-shirt, for example, which we know has no protection, says Rossi. About 30 researchers from EMPA, the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne (ETHZ, EPFL), and Spiez laboratory are contributing their expertise. Partner hospitals include the University Hospital of Zurich, Inselspital Bern, and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). Some 200 companies from the Swiss Textiles industry association are on board. With the ReMask project, the researchers hope to help the country avoid a shortage of masks, both now and in the longer term.

So far the T-shirt sales have raised CHF179,000 ($183,000) for Swiss Solidarity, the humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation. At an April 16 press conference on the government’s coronavirus confinement exit strategy, Berset said (in French) that it should be done as quickly as possible and as slowly as necessary”. A communications agency from Fribourg put that on a T-shirt and launched the sale a day later. Co-managing director Pete Mager said the T-shirt had been in great demand and sales were higher than hoped. Swiss Solidarity launched a campaign on March 23 calling for financial help to support the elderly and the homeless, as well as people in need who struggle to cope with dramatic income losses due to the coronavirus restrictions ordered by the government. It said CHF15 million ($15.3 million) had been raised in the first two weeks of a campaign, but more money was still needed as demand from vulnerable sections of society continues to build up.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The trend in the number of cases is good, but we do not want it to rise again, Koch told a news conference on Friday. He was speaking ahead of a first loosening of anti-coronavirus measuresExternal link from Monday. The ban remains on gatherings of more than five people, while social distancing and hygiene rules must be strictly observed, he said.

Only if the numbers can be reduced further will it be possible to return to some kind of normality in the summer, said Koch. Meanwhile, the armed forces command says it has begun demobilising about 1,000  soldiers taking part in support operations over the past 40 days. In total, about 4,000 members of the militia army have been on duty at hospitals, the Swiss borders and outside foreign embassies since mid-March.

Marcel Tanner, a member of the government’s Covid-19 task force, does not expect a vaccine against the infectious disease to be available within 15 to 18 months at the earliest. “There won’t be any football matches with mass spectators or concerts [this summer],” Tanner told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper in an interview published on Friday. Tanner, a former professor of epidemiology at the University of Basel and director of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, expects the government to ease restrictions on public and private gatherings of  more than five people sooner. He also said he expected that most people can go back to work in June if the necessary safety precautions are respected, including in public transport. “We can be pragmatic about this,” he said. “Personally, I’d prefer to make the wearing of masks mandatory in public transport.” Tanner is sceptical that it will be possible to resume our routines in daily life very soon. He says it would take at least 60% of the population to develop an immunity against coronavirus. Tanner believes this could take up to the autumn of 2021. Tanner also rejected criticism by various interest groups which want the government to ease the lockdown for the business community quickly. The government strategy foresees a gradual relaxing of restrictions as of next Monday, followed by a further step on June 11, depending on the number of new infections.

2020-04-24;Huge repatriation operation draws to an end ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-_huge-repatriation-operation-draws-to-an-end-/45713898;Flights from India on Saturday and Africa next Wednesday will conclude the biggest repatriation operation ever mounted by the Swiss foreign ministry, in response to the coronavirus crisis.  Nearly 7,000 people stranded abroad have been repatriated on 33 flights since the operation began on March 22, the ministry saidExternal link on Friday. Nearly 4,000 of these passengers are Swiss, while the rest are from other countries, mainly European. About one third of these foreigners reside in Switzerland, according to the ministry.  At the same time, more than 1,500 Swiss nationals have returned home on flights organised by other countries.  The foreign ministry says the operation would not have been possible without the “professionalism and hard work” of Swiss representations around the world.  “The efforts of Swiss embassy and consulate staff, working in close cooperation with local authorities, proved decisive in obtaining the necessary flight permits, means of transportation and clearances to enable Swiss nationals scattered around the world, in some cases in remote areas, to reach the airports from which the flights departed”, says the statement.  The total cost of some CHF10 million ($10.2 million) has been covered by the Swiss foreign ministry but “repatriated individuals will be expected to contribute to the operation by paying the equivalent of the market rate for a standard fare”, according to the press release.  Now that the operation is drawing to a close, the ministry says its main focus will shift to “providing support for Swiss citizens who, for a variety of reasons, have been unable or unwilling to return to Switzerland”.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-24;How the coronavirus hurts the socially marginalised in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/political-participation_how-the-coronavirus-hurts-the-socially-marginalised-in-switzerland/45711596; The coronavirus crisis is exacerbating social inequality in Switzerland, experts say. This in turn can become a threat to democracy itself. In Switzerland, vulnerable members of society – the self-employed left without customers, single mothers, people in debt, pensioners without assets, and the marginalised – are bearing the brunt of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of them are falling through the safety net as they are excluded from the federal government’s CHF40 billion aid package. Neither guaranteed loans for companies facing a liquidity squeeze nor state compensation for short-time work have kept Switzerland from experiencing the biggest hike in unemployment figures, registered at the beginning of April. According to social welfare statistics, 807,000 people received extended social benefits from municipalities and cantons in 2018. More up-to-date figures are not yet available, but the lockdown has already led to a sharp increase in applications since March. “In view of the looming economic crisis and high unemployment, we have to protect Swiss society from a social meltdown,” says Oliver Nachtwey, an associate professor of social structure analysis at the University of Basel. In order to do so, the economist and sociologist wants to go one step further than the federal government. “Everyone should be able to benefit from the aid package,” Nachtwey says. Social inequality can potentially become a threat to democracy. This happens when those missing out also disengage in other areas and no longer consider themselves part of the “common cause”, namely the state. “Social inequality is directly related to traditional forms of political participation, especially when it comes to popular votes and elections,” says Flavia Fossati, who teaches at the Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration (IDHEAP) at the University of Lausanne.  According to Fossati, political participation heavily depends on education, socialisation, financial resources as well as gender. “Well educated people have more cognitive skills and better access to information. They have networks to move around in,” says Fossati.  This does not only stimulate discussions and opinion-making, but it also encourages political participation. She says that people who are socially marginalised tend to participate less and are not as well represented. Fossati and Nachtwey point out that this trend is linked to the dwindling power of trade unions. “The labour movement, especially trade unions, used to advocate for the more vulnerable members of society and also represented them in parliament,” says Nachtwey.  Nowadays, only a few candidates with this profile make it to the national parliament. This has led to a spiral of estrangement and disillusionment. Nachtwey explains this by using his native Germany as an example. “A quarter of the population there is experiencing social stagnation or even a decline. They have distanced themselves from believing in democracy as they do not consider it a political form of government that benefits everyone.” “Many parliamentary decisions predominantly serve the interests of the middle and upper classes,” he adds. Fossati puts it like this: “If part of the population is not only socially, but also politically, disconnected, the danger of people disengaging will be higher.”  This would gnaw away at two distinctive Swiss characteristics: the citizens’ great satisfaction with politics on the one hand, and their high level of trust in political institutions, on the other. Fossati believes that this is down to the high level of political participation that comes with direct democracy. “The fact that the Swiss have the opportunity to go to the polls four times a year legitimises democracy.” Swiss efficiency – the speed and way in which the federal government and parliament deal with political problems – also contributes to this trust. Fossati is convinced that other factors, such as a strong economy, guaranteed basic rights and the rule of law, also promote a high level of satisfaction and trust. When it comes to income inequality, which is expressed using the statistical measure of distribution called the Gini coefficient, Switzerland ranks in the middle in Europe. Nordic countries are generally more homogenous, while southern countries show greater inequalities. For Nachtwey, however, it is not so much the degree of social inequality that is significant, but rather its impact. The key is knowing if and when these inequalities will have an effect on political participation. “Despite a major wealth gap in Switzerland, where some cantons are richer and others poorer, living standards are still relatively high compared to other countries”, he says. “You can enjoy a good quality of life even if you are in the low-income bracket. Alienation or disengagement is not that strong yet, as those with a lower social status are still considered members of society.” This is very different from the United States, for example, where states such as Alabama have implemented sophisticated mechanisms with the sole purpose of excluding more disadvantaged residents. “This is an example of how ethnic, economic and political discrimination adds up,” says Nachtwey. He considers direct democracy to be a tool that can be used to combat social inequality. “Direct democracy is also a gateway for social initiatives. In canton Basel City, for example, most of the citizens voted in favour of social housing in a referendum.” Although the pay gap has been widening in Switzerland since the 1990s, by 2012 (the most recent date for which data is available) social inequality was offset thanks to social welfare measures and to greater female participation in the workforce. The oronavirus pandemic is now threatening this fragile equilibrium. For Flavia Fossati, the stakes are all the higher. “A good educational system and a healthy welfare state are still key to preventing inequality. These are the most effective weapons to combat the segregation of a group that is left behind.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-24;Switzerland sees more online crime amid coronavirus shock;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/law-and-order-_coronavirus-shock-creates-fertile-ground-for-online-crime-/45710562;Creative criminals are cashing in on the Covid-19 pandemic, tricking people out of their money online. A Swiss website dedicated to tracking cases of coronavirus fraud has logged more than 200 cases since its launch one month ago, most of them online scams relating to overpriced or bogus products. “Most of the crimes that we have identified are carried out on the internet, so emails, websites, fake shops or posters for masks, emails offering masks that are fake,” says criminologist Olivier Beaudet-Labrecque. “In fact, you order the mask and never receive it. What we see the most are things that have a link to the internet and concern hygiene goods, such as masks, gels, gloves etc.” The website coronafraud.chExternal link was launched on March 26 by The Institute for Combating Economic Crime (ILCE)External link at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO) in Neuchtel. The data collected is intended for research and is not passed on to the authorities.  The national contact point for cyber security issues is the Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance (MELANI).External link As of April 23, some 163 of a total 245 reports made on coronafraud.ch related to hygiene goods that were either non-compliant (expired mask, for example) or sold at what the victim considered to be an “abusive” price. About 21 reports related to businesses and shops who were not abiding by the guidelines of the authorities. The remainder were either irrelevant reports or ones relating to phishing efforts or dubious websites offering miracle remedies and online testing for coronavirus. Some of the more shocking acts of fraud include the sale of masks for as much as CHF300 ($308) a piece and people who volunteer to do the groceries for the elderly, take their money but never deliver the goods. The elderly, however, are not necessarily the most likely victims for these kinds of crimes, in part because they are not huge internet users relative to other age groups. The bulk of the victims were aged 31-50.  “There is no specific victim profile,” notes Beaudet-Labrecque. “It affects all ages and both sexes… Because you are more vulnerable, you are quicker to trust people offering help.”  Some opportunists are posing as well-known organisations responding to the pandemic. A notorious case concerned a phishing email requesting a Bitcoin donation for the World Health Organization, so that it could help to ensure front-line workers get essential supplies and countries with the “weakest health systems” are able to cope with Covid-19.  “Due to the general uncertainty surrounding the Coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in criminals looking to take advantage of the situation,” notes Credit Suisse on its website, encouraging its clients to remain vigilant against government impersonation scams, investment scams relating to Covid-19 supplies, fraudulent donations and fraudsters who create clone firms.  Zurich Police have warned against fake coronavirus mapping apps and fraudulent fundraisers.  The European police authority made a similar warning focused on phony medicine in late March. As news site Deutsche Welle reported at the time, police identified 2,000 websites offering fake coronavirus treatments during a global sting operation codenamed “Pandea”. About four million packages of fake medicine were seized across 90 countries.  In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning to Americans on March 22. “Scammers are leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic to steal your money, your personal information, or both,” noted the alert. It warned the public to watch out for fake emails from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Fraudsters, noted the alert, can use emailed links to deliver malware and steal personal data or lock a computer and demand payment from its user.  Beaudet-Labrecque sees some parallels between the Swiss experience and the kind of fraud committed after a natural disaster, such as a tornado hitting the USt. In both cases, people emerge offering “help”, preying on the vulnerable state of the victim who has been hit by catastrophe.  “Being in a total state of shock, stress and fear creates conditions that are very auspicious for economic crime,” says the criminologist, who teaches at ILCE.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-23;Geneva Covid-19 study: undetected cases, but too few for herd immunity;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/serological-test_antibody-test-results-suggest-6x-more-covid-19-infections-in-geneva/45712418;Initial results from a serological antibody test in canton Geneva has estimated that over 5% of the Geneva population – some 27,000 people – could have been infected by the novel coronavirus. That is more cases than counted by officials, but fewer than researchers had hoped for to achieve immunity. The studyExternal link released by the Geneva University Hospital on Wednesday is based on blood samples taken from 760 people in Geneva. Serological tests were used to detect a specific antibody type G, which is directed against the pathogen. The test confirms the presence of antibodies in the blood, but researchers caution that this does not indicate whether someone has any immunity against the virus. Based on the sample, the researchers estimate that the seroprevalence in the population to be 5.5% on April 17, 2020, which means that 27,000 people would have been exposed to the coronavirus. This is much higher than the official government estimates for canton Geneva, which is around 4,900 confirmed cases on Thursday. Geneva has been one of the hardest-hit cantons in Switzerland. The fact that the actual number of infected people was far higher than the official positive test was expected given testing for the virus (not the antibodies) has largely focused on people displaying symptoms or at high risk of serious illness. Some experts say, however, that this is still far off from what they had hoped in order to achieve “herd immunity” whereby a significant portion of the population (upwards of 70%) are immune to infection. What is already emerging is that the proportion of infected people is smaller than hoped for,” Isabella Eckerle, virologist at Geneva University Hospital, told Swiss public television SRFExternal link. In a press release, the hospital stated that the results of the study indicate that the serological test platform at the hospital reliably confirms exposure to Covid-19 twenty days after the onset of symptoms. Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche announced that it will be launching its own antibody test in May. In an interview in Reuters on Wednesday, CEO Severin SchwanExternal link warned that some of the current tests marketed to tell people if they have been infected, are a “disaster”. He told reporters, these tests are not worth anything or have very little use”. On Thursday, the Swiss School of Public HealthExternal link – a consortium of 12 universities – announced the launch of a nationwide study to assess the proportion of the Swiss population with antibodies against the new coronavirus. The study called “Corona Immunitas” is a public-private partnership supported by the Federal Office of Public health, private companies, and individual experts. The study, which is scheduled to run for six months, will invite 25,000 residents in Switzerland to participate in antibody blood tests. This is intended to provide reliable data on the number of antibody carriers in different regions and in specific population groups, as well as on the extent and duration of immunity against Covid-19.

2020-04-23;Switzerland facing biggest economic slump since 1975;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-fallout_switzerland-facing-biggest-economic-slump-since-1975/45711518;​​​​​​​ In a revised forecast in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, federal authorities predict GDP will contract by 6.7% in 2020 and recover slowly in 2021. On Thursday, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) announced that it had adjusted 2020 economic forecasts to take into account sporting events affected by the pandemic. The original revised forecast estimated the economy would contract by 1.5%.External link Unemployment is expected to average 3.9% over the year. In a press releaseExternal link, SECO warned that this would make it the biggest slump in economic activity since 1975. This is a more dire prediction than that of the BAK Economics InstituteExternal link, a Basel-based think tank, which at the end of March predicted a drop in GDP of 2.5% in 2020. This is attributed to disruptions in global supply chains and the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Switzerland that have necessitated widespread public health containment measures since mid-March. The forecast expects a modest recovery with the easing of restrictions in the next few months. However, income losses due to high rates of partial and full unemployment as well as the considerable economic uncertainty “will limit the amount of lost ground that private consumption will be able to make up in the second half of the year”, according to the economic ministry. Rising government debt in many countries as well as further upheaval in the financial markets and Swiss real estate sector could also exacerbate risks. Switzerland is also heavily affected by the decision to postpone the 2020 Olympic GamesExternal link and other major sporting events given the large number of sporting associations in the country. Assuming no further restrictive measures, the Swiss economy should continue its fragile recovery in 2021, with GDP forecasted to grow by 5.2%. Unemployment is set to rise further to 4.1% in 2021, with employment only likely to see a minimal rise. The economic lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus have led to a spike in requests for social assistance. In the first two weeks after the government declared an “exceptional situation”, the number of welfare applications quadrupled. This is according to a studyExternal link by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, which found that those most affected were hourly wage workers, those in part-time jobs and the self-employed.

2020-04-23;True or False: Children are not the drivers of the coronavirus pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fact-check_true-or-false--children-are-not-the-drivers-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/45710550;A claim by Switzerland’s head of infectious diseases that children are not the main vectors of Covid-19 has not stopped many parents from wondering if it really is safe to send their children back to school next month.  A day after the government announced the re-opening of primary schools, set for May 11, Daniel Koch clarified his position on the role played by children in transmitting the novel coronavirus.  “Children are most certainly not the drivers of this epidemic,” Koch, a key figure in the government’s response to the crisis, said on April 17.   “Of course, there are children who have been infected, mostly by their parents. But children are not vectors [and] are not really impacted [by the virus].”   This week Koch repeated these reassurances as several online petitionsExternal link against the return to school garnered thousands of signatures from worried parents and teachers.   The lack of ample data on the role children play in transmitting Covid-19 may be driving this uncertainty, as experts also appear divided on how to interpret emerging research in this area.  In many countries, far fewer children than adults have tested positive for Covid-19. In Switzerland, people under 20 accounted for just 859 of the 28,100 positive casesExternal link registered by April 22 – roughly 3%. There are similarly low ratesExternal link of infection in the United States (2%), China, (2.2%), Italy (1.2%) and Spain (0.8%). It is possible that cases are underreported, since children are less likely to experience symptoms – a study of over 2,000 minors with Covid-19 in China, for example, found that over 90%External link were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms – and many countries have not tested systematically for the virus.  Many countries have also reported fewer cases of children being hospitalised. Death from Covid-19 among children is rare. To date, no child under 20 has died from the virus in Switzerland. Experts are still trying to understand why the disease seems to be less severe in children. The infection rates may be low, but according to some experts, this does not mean children are not susceptible to catching the virus. In one analysisExternal link, scientists followed 391 people who contracted the virus in Shenzhen, southeastern China, along with nearly 1,300 of their close contacts, and found that 7%-8% of the contacts aged under 10 later tested positive – similar to the rate of adult infection.  Once children are infected, the next piece of the puzzle is knowing to what extent they transmit the disease. But since relatively few cases involve children, there is little data to rely on and little consensus among experts on the conclusions that can be drawn.  After analysing some 2,500 paediatric cases of Covid-19, many of which were mild or asymptomatic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) saidExternal link “patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission”. But the CDC also pointed out that its sample contained missing data.   The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is more cautiousExternal link, saying “there is still some uncertainty” about the role children play in transmission.  Daniel Koch said that his own statement was based on discussions with Swiss paediatricians specialising in infectiology.  One of them, Christoph Berger, toldExternal link the Neue Zürcher Zeitung: “There is some evidence to suggest that children and adolescents are not the main drivers of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic.”   The case of a nine-year-old boy who contracted Covid-19 in the French Alps but did not transmit the disease, despite having contact with over 170 people, led experts who investigated his case to concludeExternal link that children probably don’t play an important role in virus transmission.   The child, who was also infected with the flu and a common cold at the time, had a low viral load – or few viral particles – in his body, along with mild symptoms. This low level of infection may explain why he did not infect people around him.  “It’s likely that this happens to many children,” Kostas Danis, one of the lead investigators, told swissinfo.ch. “They have fewer or milder symptoms, so they’re less likely to transmit the disease.”  Studies of family clusters also suggest that children are catching the virus from adults, who tend to be harder hit by the virus, Danis added.  Despite the pushback in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe against the re-opening of schools, closing them in the first place may not even have much effect on the spread of Covid-19. A team in the UKExternal link this month said that school closures have a greater impact on slowing the spread of viruses, such as influenza, that have a higher transmission rate in children than in adults.   And according to these researchers, the reverse appears to be true for the new coronavirus: children appear less likely to transmit the disease than adults, so school closures may actually be less effective in the current crisis than other measures, like social distancing.  “I don’t think we will see an increase in the number of cases because of the schools [re-opening],” said Danis, an epidemiologist at the French public health office. “The risk [of contracting the virus] is low – it would be higher in settings with more symptomatic adults.”  Exactly what role children play in transmitting the novel coronavirus remains one of the many unanswered questions of this crisis. Evidence is still emerging, but the existing data is leading some – though not all – experts to suggest that children appear less likely than adults to transmit the disease.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-23;Swiss drinking more local wine;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/beverage-of-choice_swiss-drinking-more-local-wine/45710962;"Consumers in Switzerland drank around 255 million litres of wine last year – about 20% of which was homegrown white. In 2019, wine consumption in Switzerland rose by 4.7% on 2018. This corresponds to almost 40 bottles per capita. The popularity of Swiss wine – especially white – is growing, according to the Federal Office for Agriculture. Between 2018 and 2019, consumption of Swiss white wine increased by 10.3% to around 48 million litres; that of Swiss red went up by 1.6 % to 44.3 million litres. Consumption of foreign white wine also increased, but less so, and totalled around 41 million litres (+5.9 %) in 2019. Consumption of foreign red wine increased to 119.8 million litres (+3.4 %). Total sparkling wine consumption in Switzerland rose by 3.3 % to about 20 million litres. More statistics are available in GermanExternal link, French or Italian.

2020-04-23;Swiss aid groups help counter fake coronavirus news;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/humanitarian-work_swiss-aid-groups-help-counter-fake-coronavirus-news/45705102;In Africa and Latin America, rumours and misinformation are spreading as fast as the coronavirus. Swiss development and humanitarian organisations have stepped up efforts to protect the population and counter fake news with focused media projects.  Some examples of the misinformation being spread are: Almost every African and Latin American country has reported infections and deaths from the virus. While the numbers are comparatively low at the moment, several countries have already imposed curfews. They fear an infectious tsunami that would overwhelm local health care systems.  The new and old (pre-internet) media are the only source of reliable information, particularly during curfews.  The Swiss organisations spearheading the media projects, Solidar SuisseExternal link and Fondation HirondelleExternal link, have decades of field experience to fall back upon. Their aim is to help fight the spread of the virus, along with the plethora of “fake news” and unfounded rumours surrounding it. For example, Solidar Suisse, which strives for a fairer society and living wages, is intensifying its hygiene campaigns. These were already underway before the virus spread, in all affected countries of operation. In Bolivia, Solidar Suisse is using a cartoon figure created 16 years ago, “Doctora Edilicia”, to disseminate vital messages and information concerning the pandemic. Because the organisation had raised its profile over the years by providing information on topics such as democratic rights or violence against women, it “now enjoys a very high level of credibility”, says Klaus Thieme, Head of Development Cooperation at Solidar Suisse. “This is essential in the current situation.”  In many countries of operation, misleading information about the cause and treatment of Covid-19 is being spread by different sources, says Thieme. “Sometimes through government sources, sometimes from charlatans and religious fanatics, but also simply through the blithe sharing of rumours by the population.” The cartoon figure Doctora EdiliciaExternal link counters this misinformation on Facebook, in radio spots, and in newspapers. She is supported by another Solidar Suisse project, Bolivia Verifica, which checks news for accuracy and communicates fact-based information through Doctora Edilicia, among others.  On Facebook, the Doctora explains to a teenager that the virus does not only affect the “weak”. In a radio spot, she talks to a woman about why hygiene measures are important. Her message – “I don’t think you want to be an ally of this virus” – is broadcast with the hashtag #DeVosDependemos (“We rely on you.”).  The Doctora is also aware of what the curfew means for the many women in Bolivia who are now confined with violent partners all day. She calls on people to get in touch with women in need who live nearby and shares contact numbers and places where women can get help. “Urge her to get help, and help her so she doesn’t feel alone during these times.” In the countries where Fondation Hirondelle is active, the list of examples of misinformation being spread is “unfortunately very long”, says Caroline Vuillemin, head of the Lausanne-based foundation which focuses on responsible journalism in crisis situations.  Hirondelle has been working for 25 years, mainly in francophone Africa, where a number of scurrilous rumours are now circulating, such as:  The radio stations and production studios that Hirondelle has built up over the years are now being used to broadcast fact-based news and information about the virus. The foundation’s work is concentrated in fragile and conflict-ridden countries, where reliable news is often scarce. “We have run cross-national campaigns before, but this is the first time we have been confronted with such a global crisis affecting all of our partner countries at the same time,” says Vuillemin. “This campaign is one of the biggest we have run since we were founded.”  From Burkina Faso to the Central African Republic, from Niger to Madagascar, Fondation Hirondelle studios and radio stations produce and broadcast bulletins several times a week with information on codes of conduct and hygiene measures. Listeners are encouraged to call radio talk shows with their questions.  At Studio Hirondelle RDC in the Democratic Republic of Congo, journalists are using social media channels to reach the population with its messages. “The virus is real. It kills. It’s not racist. It hits whites and blacks. Poor and rich. Politicians and celebrities,” says a young reporter in a YouTube clipExternal link. “Be responsible. If everyone protects themselves, we are all protected.”  Established journalistic rules and fact-checks are central to the work of the journalists in all programmes, said Vuillemin. “Our aim is to reach less well-educated people with timely and comprehensive information and awareness campaigns, which is why we produce content not only in French but also in local languages.”  This is particularly important in African countries already weakened by other crises and conflicts.  In these countries the pandemic and the associated “epidemic of misinformation” could fuel conflicts or cause them to flare up again, said Vuillemin.  “We want to give all sections of the population a voice and promote dialogue. The broadcasts should accompany people especially in this period of isolation and promote solidarity among the population.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-23;Majority of Swiss in favour of contact tracing via smartphones;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_majority-of-swiss-in-favour-of-contact-tracing-via-smartphones/45709412;According to a survey, 64% of Swiss residents are in favour of being tracked in return for alerts when they come into contact with people infected with the coronavirus.  The survey, carried out by consulting firm DeloitteExternal link, revealed that 60% of respondents would be prepared to install such a contact tracing application on their own phone. Around 30% fully support being tracked, and 34% are rather favourable to the idea. Of the sceptical respondents, only a small proportion (14% of all respondents) categorically reject the anonymous tracking of movements. Those under 30 years of age were slightly more inclined to approve tracking measures (68%). The approval rate is also above average among those working in the information technology or telecommunications sector (78%). There was no significant difference in the responses between different regions or between rural and urban areas. A total of 1,500 Swiss residents between the ages of 16 to 64 were surveyed during the Easter holidays.  Switzerland plans to introduce a contact tracing app in the next few weeks. The decentralised contact tracing app DP-3T, designed to alert users who have come into contact with people infected with infectious diseases, should be ready by May 11, according to two Swiss universities involved in its conception. The app employs Bluetooth technology to allow smartphones to communicate with each another anonymously. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days could be alerted so as to isolate themselves and get tested.

2020-04-22;Protective masks remain optional for the Swiss public;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/safety-rules-for-covid-19-exit_protective-masks-remain-optional-for-swiss-citizens/45708560;The Swiss government has decided not to impose a general obligation for residents to wear face masks as the country starts relaxing coronavirus restrictions next week. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the government stood by its policy that healthy people are not required to wear protective masks in public. The decision was taken in consultation with Swiss experts and the Sweden-based European Centre for Disease and Prevention ControlExternal link, he said. “The best hygiene measures to prevent infections are still keeping distance and washing hands,” Berset told a news conference on Wednesday. However, the government recommends that passengers using public transport in rush hours wear protective masks. Clients in shops may also need masks in line with health and safety regulations in certain shops. + Should all Swiss be wearing face masks? A recent survey shows a majority of respondents coming out in favour of a mandatory wearing of masks. The armed forces are planning on buying up to 100 million masks which will be sold to retailers at purchasing price. The government has a budget of up to CHF400 million ($412 million) to provide the different types of masks. Defence Minister Viola Amherd said some 21 million have already been distributed among the 26 cantons. But it is the responsibility of hospitals, companies and private households to ensure a stock. Amherd also announced that the production of masks in Switzerland would be boosted with Wednesday’s arrival of two machines acquired jointly by the national government and canton Zurich. Switzerland is due to ease restrictions on April 27 with the reopening of hairdressers and beauty salons as well as DIY centres. However, a planned relaxing of regulations on major supermarket chains over the sale of non-essential items has been put off until May 11 following a storm of protest from small businesses. Strict bans also remain in place in southern Switzerland, a region bordering Italy which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite calls from right-wing and centre-right political parties as well as certain regional authorities, the government stood firm on its plan on a gradual reopening of businesses and restaurants in a bid to avoid a new wave of infections. The government on Wednesday also presented a plan to offer additional loans totaling up to CHF154 million for start-up companies which are at risk because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Ueli Maurer said start-ups could apply to be considered by a panel of experts from the national and cantonal authorities. Maurer said the financial support for the start-up community was crucial for Switzerland’s pioneering role in this sector. The government received about 109,000 requests for financial support from the business community, totaling some CHF17 billion over the past few weeks. Maurer said it was key for the industry to have enough liquidity to be able to be fully operational again. The finance minister praised the relief package as a success story and a model for other countries. “I think we are the only country in the world able not only to pledge credits but also provide practical help,” Maurer said. He added that his ministry was regularly approached by other countries in Europe and from the United States asking for advice. Maurer also warned that the shutdown of the Swiss economy came at an estimated cost of about CHF5 billion per week and that the country’s budget could result in a deficit of up to CHF40 billion this year depending on the unemployment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The longer we have to wait for the economy to come out of the lockdown, the higher the costs,” he warned. Last year, Switzerland ran a budget surplus of CHF48.9 billion. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-22;Matterhorn light show sparks joy and dismay;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/matterhorn-zermatt-coronavirus-light-show-gerry-hofstetter/45707506;"Art? Light pollution? A beacon of hope? A PR stunt? The nightly displays on the Swiss side of an iconic mountain peak are entertaining virtual visitors while worrying conservationists. Since March 24, Swiss light artist Gerry HofstetterExternal link has been beaming images onto the face of the Matterhorn above the resort of Zermatt, Switzerland. The motifs vary: flags, hashtags, icons and short messages. “The community of Zermatt asked if I’d be willing to live up here in a camp for a few weeks during the coronavirus crisis. The light is a sign of hope that our six-person team is giving the world,” Hofstetter told SWI swissinfo.ch via mobile.  He was speaking from the camp pitched at an elevation of 3,000 metres. What started as an “adventure vacation” turned into a “survival camp” after a few days.  “We sacrifice ourselves; it’s so cold [-22°C one night] and we’re lugging water for two hours or more.” Hofstetter isn’t being paid; he said he has an “innovative agreement” with the community of Zermatt to cover costs like food, transportation and electricity.  Each day he consults with the mayor of Zermatt and the CEO of Zermatt Tourism to decide which image should be projected next. According to Hofstetter’s team, the nightly displays have reached over 2.2 billion people via traditional, online and social media. Not everyone is as enthusiastic as India’s prime minister or the US embassy in Bern.  “This is a protected, natural heritage landscape, so it shouldn’t be disturbed by artificial lighting,” said Lukas Schuler, the president of Dark-Sky SwitzerlandExternal link, an interest group concerned about light pollution. He told SWI swissinfo.ch that animals like alpine ptarmigan and ibex are bothered by the light – even if you don’t see them running away. “It always has an impact, and you don’t know how much.” The Matterhorn livestreams run for a couple of hours per night. Rather than cutting the lights at 10pm – which is the norm (see box) for non-essential outdoor lighting in Switzerland – the shows are scheduled with moonlight and time zones in mind. For example, the US flag appeared at midnight on April 16, the Chinese one at 2am on April 19.  And unlike more permanent displays – such as those on urban monuments like the Lucerne water tower – the projection isn’t tailored to the contours of the mountain. This means light is beamed beyond it. “Light pollution against the pandemic? In our eyes, this staging is above all an inappropriate marketing stunt,” wrote Mountain Wilderness Switzerland on its Facebook pageExternal link. Asked about the criticism of groups like Dark-Sky and Mountain Wilderness, Hofstetter said: “I’m doing a projection for a limited time where no animals are, and if they would count all the football fields from around the world – during games and training – there would be no comparison in terms of the amount of light.”  Switzerland Tourism (ST)External link does not find the display problematic.  “Permission from the local authorities would never have been granted in ‘normal’ times,” ST spokesman André Aschwanden told SWI swissinfo.ch. “But given the extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus, the involved parties agreed about the importance and meaning of this message of hope and solidarity.” ST’s current slogan, “Dream now – travel later”, was featured on April 8: “It’s so brilliant, and so in line with #StayHome,” Hofstetter said. Everybody, whatever their time zone, can go and scroll back in the webcams of Zermatt to see. It’s an incredible fuel-saving project. You can’t visit Switzerland now to see it.”  But surely it might motivate plenty of would-be visitors to come later? “Of course, you may travel later to see the Matterhorn when the crisis is over. All you need is some time and money to visit Zermatt, but that’s another issue,” Hofstetter said.  Romy Biner-Hauser, the mayor of Zermatt, says there is no commercial or political motivation behind the light show. “It’s to express our solidarity. So it’s no coincidence that we started with [the flag of] Italy, which is so close to Zermatt and so badly affected,” she told SWI swissinfo.ch.  Dark-Sky’s Schuler is concerned that the month-long Matterhorn display will inspire similar light shows – like this one in Dubai: “I see the point of the symbolism and the message,” Schuler said. “For one evening we could understand making an exception. But it’s been going on for weeks now.” Hofstetter and his crew will come down on April 27, the day Switzerland is to begin easing the lockdown measures.  What do you think?

2020-04-22;Coronavirus tests to be extended;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/adapted-policy_coronavirus-tests-to-be-extended/45708166;The Swiss health authorities have decided to extend tests for potential coronavirus patients as part of the government’s planned Covid-19 exit strategy. All patients with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness, with or without a fever, with muscle pains and loss of taste and smell should be tested according to a statement on Wednesday by the Federal Public Health Office. Doctors will also be allowed to test patients in hospitals as well as residents of old people’s homes even if they show no symptoms. The office said the measures were a precaution to prevent a surge of Covid-19 cases when the government restrictions are to be gradually eased as of next Monday. At the same time, the health authorities plan to resume a contact tracing policy using an application on mobile phones. However, the office advises against a broad campaign with blood tests. Experts argue so-called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests are more reliable. They are based on specimens taken from a patient’s nasal swabs and sputum.

2020-04-22;Switzerland pledges over CHF1 million to Greek asylum centres;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/aid-for-migrants-_switzerland-pledges-over-chf1-million-to-greek-asylum-centres/45708038;A sum of CHF1.1 million ($1.13 million) has been promised by the Swiss government to finance emergency measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in asylum centres.  The money will go to aid organisations and will mainly target children and young people living in asylum centres on the Greek Aegean islands, according to the State Secretariat for Migration.  Switzerland is also preparing to receive 22 asylum-seeking minors from the region.   The funds will support projects initiated by the United Nations refugee agency, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Orthodox Church to provide legal advice and psychological support to minors.  Preventive measures will be implemented to protect asylum seekers from possible coronavirus infection. Other projects are also under consideration.  In January, Switzerland had already proposed to host unaccompanied minors in Greece with family ties in Switzerland on the basis of the so-called Dublin III asylum regulation. To date, the Swiss immigration authorities have received and accepted applications of 22 unaccompanied minors from Greece. Although Dublin transfers are currently suspended throughout Europe because of the coronavirus, the Greek authorities have been informed that these minors may enter Switzerland immediately - in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Office of Public Health.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-21;High-profile FIFA case falls victim to the coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/corruption-in-football_high-profile-fifa-case-falls-victim-to-the-coronavirus/45706550;"The trial of four former top football officials over suspicious payments linked to the 2006 World Cup in Germany has been suspended again, meaning a verdict will not be reached. The suspension of the trial by the Swiss Federal Criminal Court means a verdict is impossible before next Monday – the day on which the statute of limitations on the allegations expires. The proceedings, which centre on a €6.7 million payment made 15 years ago in the lead-up to the World Cup in Germany, was suspended already in March due to Covid-19 disruption. The four defendants – former members of Germany’s World Cup organizing committee, as well as a Swiss former top FIFA official – are mostly all at least 70 years old, meaning they fall into the “at-risk” category for the current epidemic. German football legend Franz Beckenbauer, who was also linked to the payment but whose case is separate, had also been due to give evidence. The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) claimed that the 2005 payment was transferred from the German football federation to FIFA, where it ended up in the account of Mohammed bin Hammam, who at the time sat on the finance committee of football’s world governing body. While the motive given by the defendants for the payment was that it was to fund a World Cup-related gala, prosecutors say it was destined to induce bin Hammam to release a larger sum of €250 million that the German federation needed to finance the World Cup. The trial is one of some 25 that have been pursued involving FIFA since 2015 by the Attorney General’s Office. In February, in another high-profile case, it formally brought charges for bribery against former FIFA secretary-general Jérôme Valcke, and boss of the Paris Saint-Germain club, Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Judges said on Tuesday that due to the suspension of the trial, defendants will be entitled to compensation for legal fees; details on this have not yet been decided.

2020-04-21;Summer holidays will be sourced locally this year;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/staying-home_summer-holidays-this-year-will-be-sourced-locally/45705956;Summer 2020 is the time to rediscover your own country. With many travel restrictions and planes stuck on the ground, the tourism sector is now focusing on local guests. Reservations by Swiss residents already made up over 45% of overnight stays in 2019. The proportion could increase this year, as a third of Swiss have already changed their holiday plans. “This could be interesting for the tourism sector, as local guests are usually more spread out than the international tourists, who usually focus on famous locations,” said Switzerland Tourism spokeswoman Véronique Kanel. During a press conference held on Monday, Eric Scheidegger, head of the economic policy directorate at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), said that demand and sales development in the tourism sector could only be expected to completely return to normal in 2022.

Cassis was speaking to ministerial counterparts from Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg by video conference on Tuesday. “Covid-19 is at present still a health crisis. But the pandemic is already triggering an economic and financial crisis, and the necessary measures being taken to stem it will lead to a social crisis,” said CassisExternal link. “That’s why now is the time to think about the best way out of the crisis and the steps we need to take in the coming weeks”.  In particular Cassis recommended that social distancing restrictions should be relaxed as quickly as possible in a coordinated manner. The right balance must be struck between avoiding a new wave of infections whilst aspiring to achieve a “phased return to normality” for citizens, he said. Having banned large gatherings in February, Switzerland announced further lockdown measures on March 23, which were later extended to at least April 26. Last week, the government unveiled a three-phase plan to lift the lockdown starting from April 27. This would first see hospital services and some parts of the economy return to normality before later re-opening schools, other businesses and public spaces by June 8. Cassis did not elaborate on how exactly different countries could coordinate their lockdown exits. But he pointed to cooperation during the pandemic, such as treating patients from other countries. He also pointed to more than 30 flights that saw Switzerland organise the repatriation of 1,870 European Union citizens. Some 655 Swiss nationals have also been returned home on flights organised by Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. But Cassis made no mention of more contentious episodes during the pandemic when neighbouring countries were accused of blocking shipments of medical supplies, such as face masks and disinfectant hand gel to Switzerland. The annual meeting of foreign ministers from the five German-speaking nations has been a feature since 2006. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Although Switzerland dropped from 6th to 8th in the 2020 ranking, this was not due to a worse score, but rather to gains made by Jamaica and Costa Rica, the NGO reported on TuesdayExternal link. Overall, as per last year, the Alpine nation remains part of a group of 14 countries in the “white zone”, where press freedom is completely guaranteed. The top four spots are all occupied by the Scandinavian countries; at the other end of the list come Eritrea, Turkmenistan, and North Korea. Nevertheless, economic troubles continue to dog Swiss media, and RSF remains critical of the “accelerating concentration” of newspapers within fewer big publishing houses; this reduces diversity of voices, particularly regionally, and can hamper the process of opinion-forming necessary in a (direct) democracy, it says. It also criticised the decision by the Swiss government not to grant emergency funding to Swiss media hit by the current coronavirus crisis. Though the question of support will be discussed by parliament at a later stage, media groups are suffering under plummeting advertising revenue during the current crisis, RSF says. Some newspapers in the country have slimmed print offerings since the crisis hit, while others have put staff and journalists on short-term unemployment. Globally, RSF notes a similar picture to last year, writing that press freedom is suffering in many countries under governments that either suppress information, undermine trust in the press, or imprison journalists.

2020-04-21;Swiss biosensor can detect airborne coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fighting-covid-19_swiss-biosensor-can-detect-airborne-coronavirus/45705308;A sensor that can “see” and “feel” airborne viruses could help contain the spread of epidemics, say Swiss scientists who have developed a device that sends alerts when it detects high concentrations of Covid-19. The biosensor uses receptors engraved with the “fingerprint” of specific strands of RNA (a single strand of genetic material as opposed to the DNA double strand), which are unique to each virus. The sensor only scores a match when it comes into contact with the virus it is looking for, and is precise enough that it can tell the difference between the 2003 SARS virus and the current novel coronavirus.  To back up this “visual” match, the sensor also tests the temperature of the virus strands as they hit the receptors. When the correct virus comes into contact, it results in a thermal reaction that can also be measured to confirm the initial findings of the sensor. The device was developed by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) in collaboration with Zurich’s Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ). The team was already working on a sensor to detect airborne viruses and bacteria. Now they have shown that it can be calibrated to reliably detect Covid-19. The biosensor could be deployed in public spaces, such as hospitals or train stations, to detect high concentrations of specific viruses in the air. This could help the authorities to limit infections by keeping people away from such areas. While it would be a complementary method to established lab tests, rather than a replacement, the designers of the biosensor say that their method offers improvements on existing means of detecting viruses. However, the device is not yet ready for use in public spaces. “A number of developmental steps are still needed to do this – for example, a system that draws in the air, concentrates the aerosols in it and releases the RNA from the viruses,” reads a media statementExternal link.

2020-04-21;Swiss consumer habits changed by coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/changing-priorities_swiss-consumer-habits-changed-by-coronavirus--study-shows/45700746;Coronavirus lockdown has changed Swiss consumer habits as well as reduced the use of cash and cash machines, according to a survey. The crisis has shifted people’s priorities, according to the NZZ am Sonntag, whose source is a survey by the PostFinance bank. For example, since tough measures were introduced in mid-March people have spent 53% less on hygiene and cosmetics than a year ago. Why put on make-up if you never leave the house, asks the paper. Spending on clothes has fallen by more than half and spending on shoes by more than 80%. Basic services have become more important, with Swiss consumers spending significantly more (+18.6%) on food. In addition, food is being delivered more frequently. Because pubs and restaurants are closed, spending on catering fell. While PostFinance customers in 2019 were still treating themselves to restaurant visits worth CHF67 million ($69 million), they spent around CHF13 million on them this spring. This amount can be explained by snack bars that are still open, the paper says. Because hardly any leisure activities are allowed, you have to kill time at home in a different way, it continues. Spending on communication and media has skyrocketed. But the Swiss are apparently not thinking only of themselves. They donated around a fifth more during the crisis. The PostFinance study was compiled from its customers' online banking data, which were anonymised and legally verified, explains the NZZ am Sonntag. It covered both what was purchased with the PostFinance card in shops and online. PostFinance has around 2.7 million customers, almost 1.8 million of whom use e-banking. Many of us will fall back into our old consumer habits when things return to normal, the paper comments, but the coronavirus will leave its mark.

2020-04-21;Swift Covid-19 vaccine within reach, say Swiss scientists;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bern-research_swift-covid-19-vaccine-within-reach--say-swiss-scientists/45704796;"A team of researchers at the University of Bern is hoping to be the first to produce a vaccine against Covid-19 and inoculate the entire Swiss population in October. “We have a realistic chance of being successful,” said Martin Bachmann, head of immunology at the Swiss university via a web conference with ACANU, the United Nations press association. “Switzerland has a history of being pragmatic and is more interested in finding a compromise to get the vaccine faster.”  Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak and its designation by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) at the end of January, most international health experts and authorities have said a vaccine should not be expected for about a year to 18 months - at the earliest. Bachmann, who is also professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said his accelerated timing could be partially explained by potential ease of production, where the equivalent of 200 litres of bacterial bio ferment, which is needed for the jabs, could produce 10-20 million doses. “The vaccine is unique because of the huge scalability. It has the ability to produce billions of doses in a short time frame,” Bachmann said. The vaccine under development by the Swiss team takes a different approach than other labs by using so-called virus-like particles, which are not infectious - unlike when using the virus itself - and which provide good immunity response. A prototype was developed in February, just weeks after the new coronavirus was identified in China, and proved successful in tests on laboratory mice, when the serum neutralised the virus. Gary Jennings, CEO of Saiba BiotechExternal link which is working with the University of Bern, said the Swiss authorities are aware of the importance of approving the vaccine’s development. “We can do this if the Swiss government and the regulators want to do it. If they want to see this vaccine made available to the public in this timeframe, then it will be done.” Swissmedic, the national authority responsible for approving and supervising therapeutics, confirmed that it has already been offering scientific advice to the project and is aware of how the research is progressing. Spokesperson Lukas Jaggi told swissinfo.ch that “in this exceptional situation, we realistically have to reckon with eight to 14 months until we have a vaccine against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.” In an e-mailed statement the communications official wrote that “Swissmedic gives high priority to time. But safety and tolerability of the vaccine come first. It is therefore important that companies and research groups contact Swissmedic at an early stage so that we can accompany and support them in their development before they submit an application for authorisation.” Development of the vaccine to a point where it could be produced on a large scale will require raising CHF100 million ($103 million), according to Saiba Biotech, which Bachmann co-founded. While the USZ FoundationExternal link, the University Hospital Zurich's charitable organisation, has expressed interest in supporting the research, Jennings said that Saiba has already been in talks with pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Lonza. Worldwide some 2.5 million people have tested positive for coronavirus with 170,000 deaths, including a growing number in countries with limited health services. Switzerland has reported nearly 28,000 cases and more than 1,400 fatalities. A previous version of this story indicated that the USZ Foundation belongs to the University of Bern; it belongs to the University Hospital Zurich.

Another 25 have been isolated after presenting Covid-19 symptoms. Asylum centers are following the same protocols and restrictions as the rest of the population, notes the news agency. An occupancy rate of 40% across federal asylum centers means it is possible to follow the guidelines issued by health authorities. + A look at Switzerland’s new asylum system The occupancy rate at cantonal facilities ranges between 60 to 100% so new infrastructures have been made available to respect social distancing norms. Switzerland has halted the transfer of asylum-seekers to other members of the Schengen area, an option it has under the Dublin agreement. Transfers within the country are also being avoided. Federal asylum centers and cantonal facilities register about a dozen entries per week, compared to 120 and 180 for the months of January and February.

2020-04-20;Stimulus package to help tourism hit by coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/leg-up_stimulus-package-to-help-tourism-hit-by-coronavirus/45703380;The government is considering a financial package to help boost Swiss tourism, a sector particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The economics ministry and parliamentary committees are examining a proposal by the national marketing organisation, Switzerland TourismExternal link, for a stimulus package worth CHF40 million ($41.3 million), according to Erik Jakob of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). “But first we have to assure the tourism industry survives [the shock] before we can invest,” Jakob told a news conference on Monday. Demand has collapsed and bookings are on hold. The industry is expected to suffer a drop in revenue of up to 35% this year, according to SECO estimates. So far, the government has granted the tourism sector loans and short-time work unemployment benefits. It is also considering regional promotion programmes. Jakob said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is not comparable to previous crises, notably the strong Swiss franc, and it could take tourism in Switzerland more than 12 months to recover. He added that a campaign to promote Swiss holiday destinations would have to focus on domestic customers before it can try to attract tourists from abroad. “It is difficult to find the right moment for the launch of a promotion drive,” he said. Jakob said customers must first gain confidence in the health safety precautions taken by the tourism sector, including hotels, restaurants as well as transport. Efforts are underway to prepare specific measures. The tourism industry, considered one of a key sectors for the country’s economy, produced revenue of CHF44.7 billion in 2018 - about 3% of GDP - according to the Swiss Tourism FederationExternal link.

We are scattered across nearly all of the language regions in Switzerland and capturing the reactions to the crisis from wherever we are working – whether it is a small village in the countryside, a big housing complex in cities like Zurich or Geneva, or a tourist destination in the Bernese Alps. Unlike the other units of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, swissinfo.ch has been publishing stories exclusively online for around 20 years, without a broadcast component. This has made for a relatively seamless transition to producing content for our ten language websites and more than thirty social media accounts from our home offices. Here’s a glimpse at some of them:  While colleagues miss the communal coffee breaks and informal interactions, our laptops and the internet have allowed us to continue bringing our multilingual content to our readers wherever they are in the world.​​​​​​​ Our latest readership figures show the extent to which that content from Switzerland has been used during the coronavirus crisis. Based on reader reactions and exchanges on social media, readers come from all over the world and different walks of life. The Swiss abroad, people with business ties to Switzerland, foreigners living in Switzerland, journalists from international media outlets, tourists, travel agents and scientists are some of the readers who have been using swissinfo.ch as a guide to the coronavirus situation. Our news and in-depth reporting in 10 languages reached more readers last month than ever before as more people sought accessible and reliable information on the latest developments in the coronavirus crisis. These are the latest figures from the independent industry organisation Netmetrix: Meeting the demands of such a varied readership requires a diverse team.

2020-04-20;60% of Swiss support face mask regime;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_60--of-swiss-support-face-mask-regime/45701902;"Three-fifths of respondents in a nationwide survey have said they are in favour of the mandatory wearing of protective masks in public in an effort to stem the spread of Covid-19. The surveyExternal link, published on Monday by newspapers from the Tamedia group, found that the support cut right across the political spectrum. However, it also included the caveat that such an obligation would be desirable only as soon as the equipment is available in Switzerland; at the moment, this is unclear. Fabian Vaucher, president of the Swiss Pharmacy Association PharmasuisseExternal link, said on Monday that the supply of masks was a “catastrophe”, and that pharmacies often lacked such equipment, placing employees, clients, and patients in danger of infection. He also criticised the lack of clarity and responsibility from federal authorities. “For weeks, our concerns have been sent around from A to B and back again,” he said. Vaucher says he wants the government to publish clear guidelines on how at-risk parts of the population can get masks. So far, the government has not recommended that the population wear protective masks, but as the country prepares to enter a phase of lifting protective measures, which means more open shops and public spaces, the question is coming up again and again. Nevertheless, the Tamedia survey also found a big majority (83% out of a total of 40,835 online respondents) praised the performance of the government’s handling of the coronavirus, while two-thirds were happy with the balance found between protecting public health and keeping the economy moving. This continues a trend reportedExternal link in regular opinion surveys run by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (swissinfo.ch’s parent company), which found just under 90% of respondents have average or above-average confidence in political leadership. Meanwhile, just over half of Tamedia respondents were against the idea of a “herd immunity” strategy, which would see citizens become progressively infected by the virus. Three-quarters of respondents said they would support mandatory vaccination, should a vaccine be found. Another survey published on Monday, this time by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts,External link found that one-third of Swiss have modified their 2020 holiday plans, either by changing destination or cancelling altogether. However, if mountain railways begin running again, and if cross-border trips to neighbouring countries like Italy or Spain become possible again, 38% of the 1,003 people surveyed say they would go ahead with such holidays as normal. The Swiss tourism sector, meanwhile, hopes to mitigate the damage it will suffer from the collapse in foreign visits by enticing nationally confined Swiss holidaymakers to take a trip locally.

2020-04-20;Coronavirus called a ‘decisive test’ for the UN system  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/multilateralism--_coronavirus-called-a--decisive-test--for-the-un-system--/45688662;The pandemic is testing the limits of the United Nations system, say Geneva and New York-based experts, amid funding challenges and an ongoing blame game between the United States and China.   The UN is marking its 75th anniversaryExternal link this year. What could have been a year of celebration is becoming a year of crisis. Antonio Guterres, its secretary-general, called the pandemic the most challenging crisis the UN has faced since the Second World War .  The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) has played a leading role in fighting the virus, amid criticism, most recently by the Trump administration of its response to the pandemic and position towards China. Other UN agencies and international organisations have also scrambled to respond under lockdowns.    So far, member states’ responses to the pandemic have been largely unilateral and the UN Security Council has been conspicuously silent. It met by video conference for the first time on April 9 and afterwards merely issued a statement expressing support for Guterres’ efforts and a need for unity.   In separate interviews, Richard GowanExternal link, who oversees the International Crisis Group's advocacy work at the United Nations in New York, and Thomas BierstekerExternal link, a professor of international relations and political science at the Geneva Graduate Institute, share their perspectives on what’s at stake in the UN response to the pandemic.    Richard Gowan: This is a decisive test for the UN's relevance in the 21st century. If the UN's member states ultimately succeed in working together to contain the disease, and if UN agencies can play a significant role in coordinating the fight, it will show why multilateralism matters. This is especially important for weak and poor countries, which are likely to need a lot of technical and economic assistance to manage the fallout from Covid-19. If, however, governments fail to coordinate and pursue a fragmented, nationalist approach to limit the disease's spread, many will conclude that the UN is no longer relevant. This could have negative consequences for coordination on issues from climate change to human rights.   Thomas Biersteker: The initial reaction of most countries seems to be to close the border and not to refer to the multilateral system. At one level, this is not surprising. Multilateralism is definitely facing a moment of truth, but it's too soon to say what the implications are. I think the longer we experience the consequences of these uncoordinated moves, the more we'll realise the limitations of acting at the national level alone.     R.G.: The majority of Security Council members want to act on the crisis, although it is important to recognise that the Council cannot and should not try to replace the WHO in directing international health interventions. But at a minimum, the Council should be dealing with the pandemic's likely impact on stability and security in regions like Africa and the Middle East, in line with the Secretary-General's call for a global ceasefire. The main reason it has failed to act is tension between China and the US. The Americans have insisted that any Council resolution on the disease should explicitly reference its origins in China, which Beijing cannot accept. The world's top powers are indulging in a silly blame game in a moment of crisis.    T.B.: There is an inherent conservatism in the Council not to go too far beyond agreed-upon language and not to be too innovative. Interestingly China is reticent. They are very protective of ideas of state sovereignty and are really nervous about expanding the mandate of the Council when it involves the authority of the state. I would suspect because of the very pointed US criticism, China doesn't want to find itself on the receiving end of a Security Council resolution, as they have no capacity to block anything. So, they are being very conservative. But it's basically a blame game between US and China, with the US trying to hold China accountable, which is making multilateral cooperation difficult.    R.G.: The UN system was very slow to get a grip on the scale of the challenge. Even in mid-March, a lot of UN officials in New York didn't seem fully cognizant of how the pandemic was going to change their strategic picture. But Guterres and the UN system as a whole deserve a lot of credit for accelerating their response to the crisis over the last two or three weeks. The Secretary-General's series of statements on the security and socio-economic aspects of the pandemic have shown a degree of foresight that a lot of national leaders have conspicuously failed to offer. And at the working level, I think that UN humanitarian officials, peacemakers and others are now working very hard to find ways to mitigate this mess. There is a sense that UN officials are managing this quite a bit better than the member states, but they ultimately need governments' political and financial support during the crisis.    T.B.: The pattern, and challenge to multilateralism is that member states have been reducing their contributions to international organisations. We have experienced this in Geneva with the cashflow crisis at the UN. The financial crisis is ongoingExternal link.  What people need to understand is that WHO is severely underfunded. When it was founded, 100% of its operating revenue came from member state contributions, but that number is now under 20%. We have to understand the constraints these organisations are under.    R.G.: I would say that donors are likely to scrape together funds for UN humanitarian operations to countries affected by Covid-19, to contain the disease and stop it leading to large-scale movements of desperate people. Western countries don't want to face a wave of Covid refugees from Africa or the Middle East. But longer-term, poor countries are going to demand more development aid to cushion the blow of Covid-19, just as donor governments are investing every cent they have at home and a global recession cuts into overseas development aid budgets. I think that in six to 12 months we are liable to see some pretty unpleasant debates at the UN, as poor countries call for a big injection of aid to help rebuild after the crisis, and donor states make it clear there is little or no cash on offer.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-19;Cautious reopening of some border points;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/easing-lockdown_cautious-reopening-of-some-border-points/45700878;Switzerland will partially reopen five border crossing points with France in canton Geneva on Monday which had been closed as part of measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Customs Administration (FCA) said on Sunday it will reopen these points to cope with expected resumption of border traffic in the near future. The FCA says it expects a sharp increase in border traffic from April 27 following the government’s announcement this week of a crisis exit plan. It says more traffic is already expected as of Monday 20 due to factors such as the end of the Easter holidays and the resumption of travel to work in certain economic sectors. Since mid-March, the federal government has introduced border controls with neighbouring countries in a move intended to protect the Swiss population and maintain the capacity of the Swiss public health system. Entry from neighbouring countries is only permitted for Swiss citizens, people holding a residence permit and people who have to travel to Switzerland for professional reasons. Border traffic has therefore been channelled to the largest customs posts for checks, while some 130 border crossing points across Switzerland are closed. In canton Geneva, nine points are currently open or partially open, with cantonal police helping customs officers to carry out checks. The FCA says it is monitoring the situation and will adapt its border control system if necessary. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-19;SWISS expects to run only 20% of flights this summer;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_swiss-expects-to-run-only-20--of-flights-this-summer/45700594;Swiss International Air Lines expects to be running only 20% of its flight schedule this summer due to the coronavirus crisis, one of its directors says. We are making our scenario in the hope that immigration restrictions will be eased, the airline’s director for French-speaking Switzerland Lorenzo Stoll told RTS televisionExternal link on Saturday evening, but even then the summer will be very difficult for the Lufthansa subsidiary, perhaps the most difficult in its history. Stoll pointed out that the financial difficulty is exacerbated by social distancing applied in the aircraft. We leave an empty seat between each passenger in order to maintain the distances,” he told RTS. Dozens of aircraft have been grounded for almost a month in Switzerland amidst the global coronavirus crisis. This is unprecedented at Dübendorf airfield in Zurich or Geneva airport, where space had to be made on the tarmac for the SWISS and Easyjet fleets. The “confined” aircraft require rigorous mechanical maintenance, including lubrication against corrosion and combating the infiltration of insects, RTS reports, which requires personnel and costs several thousand francs per aircraft per day.

2020-04-19;Government's loosening lockdown plan under scrutiny;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hairdressers-vs-restaurants_government-s-loosening-lockdown-plan-under-scrutiny/45700410;Swiss Economics Minister Guy Parmelin says the government wants a return to economic normality as soon as possible and that state aid to companies coming out of coronavirus lockdown should not become a “pillow for laziness”. “The sectors and industries coming out of isolation or which can reopen must quickly do without short-time working subsidies and other federal government aid,” he told Le Matin Dimanche newspaper in an interview on the government plan for coming out of lockdown. The three-stage plan announced this week has come in for some criticism. Head of the Zurich cantonal government Carmen Walker Späh criticizes in the NZZ am Sonntag the fact that hairdressers will be able to reopen on 27 April but not bookshops. She also finds it incomprehensible that supermarkets can offer their full range of products but specialist shops must stay closed. Restaurants should also be able to reopen more quickly, Späh told the paper. MP Leo Müller also argues in the SonntagsZeitung that restaurants should be allowed to reopen at least partially on May 11. I do not rule out the possibility that restaurants may reopen in a few weeks' time, Parmelin told Le Matin Dimanche when asked about the issue. It depends on how the situation develops. On the issue of hair, Le Matin’s journalist starts by noting that Parmelin’s hair is longer than usual. “My wife says she can’t put up with it any longer, but help is at hand,” says the minister, explaining that his hairdresser sent a text message proposing an appointment after April 27. So why are we so obsessed with our hair? Le Matin Dimanche also carries an interview with French sociologist Michel Messu, who has written a book on this. Even in confinement, we still want to project an image to others, notably on social media, he says, and so for many people, hairdressers are almost a basic need!

2020-04-18;Swiss medical manufacturers get reprieve as EU postpones new rules;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/medical-technology_swiss-medical-manufacturers-get-reprieve-as-eu-postpones-new-rules/45699564;Swiss manufacturers have one year’s respite after the European Union decided to postpone new rules on approval of medical equipment. The move had been urged by European Union manufacturers because of low capacity to accredit under the new rules and problems the industry is facing due to coronavirus. The EU Commission agreed to postpone the deadline to May 26, 2021, and this was approved by the EU parliament on Friday. The new rules had been due to enter force on May 26 this year. Swiss manufacturers would have had not only to comply with the new rules but also prepare to lose privileged access to the EU internal market as a result of the stalled negotiations between Bern and Brussels on a new “framework agreement”. The EU has made it clear on several occasions that existing bilateral agreements with Switzerland would not be renewed without such an overall framework deal.  One of the first victims would have been the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on conformity of medical technology. The Swiss MedtechExternal link organization representing the industry in Switzerland welcomed the move. It recommended that its members use the next 12 months to prepare in an optimal way for the eventuality that the MRA is not renewed in a year , according to spokesperson Anita Holler, whilst at the same time urging the Swiss government to “work at all levels using all its possibilities to get a rapid renewal of this agreement”.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

On 16 April 2020, around 40 prisoners were exchanged between the government-controlled and non-government controlled areas of Ukraine, according to a Swiss foreign ministry press releaseExternal link. This came three months after the last such large-scale exchange, it said. The planned prisoner swap went ahead despite a state of emergency in Ukraine to combat coronavirus, “with participants agreeing on the necessary precautions and protective measures in advance”. This came after intensive negotiations within the Trilateral Contact group, a forum between the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia and Ukraine. According to the Swiss foreign ministry, the negotiations have been led since January by Heidi GrauExternal link of Switzerland, who is Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in­-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group. The contact group’s humanitarian sub-group is led by its Swiss coordinator, Toni Frisch. The armed conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels in the east has been ongoing for six years and has claimed over 13,000 lives, according to the UN. Switzerland is “committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict and promotes de-escalation and dialogue, mainly within the framework of the OSCE”, says the foreign ministry.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-18;Swiss pull out of European contact tracing App project;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-science_swiss-pull-out-of-european-contact-tracing-app-project/45699230;Two Swiss technology institutes have distanced themselves from a European anti-coronavirus tracing App project, saying it is not respectful enough of personal privacy. The Federal Technology Institute Lausanne (EPFL) and the ETH Zurich have been participating in the “Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing” project (PEPP-PT), which involves 130 organizations from eight countries. But on Friday leading EPFL epidemiologist Marcel Salathé tweeted that he was personally distancing himself from it, saying that “right now, PEPP-PT is not open enough, and it is not transparent enough”. EPFL president Martin Vetterli confirmed on Swiss television RTSExternal link that his institution was looking for another solution. On Friday evening the website heidi.news reportedExternal link that ETH Zurich was also pulling out. PEPP-PT is one of several projects being developed around the world to fight coronavirus through smartphones. The idea is to develop an App allowing smartphones to communicate anonymously with each other using Bluetooth technology. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, all the people with whom that person was in contact in previous days could be alerted so as to isolate themselves and get tested. EPFL and ETH Zurich are now putting their energies into another system called DP-3TExternal link. This is being developed by a team of 26 European researchers led by professor Carmela Troncoso at EPFL. The main difference with PEPP-PT is that data is to be stored decentrally in telephones rather than centrally, which is seen as a better guarantee of personal privacy.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-17;Warning against complacency over coronavirus risks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/infection-rate-flattens_warning-against-complacency-over-coronavirus-risks/45698002;The Swiss government has again urged residents against complacency even as the country’s coronavirus infection rate slows. Daniel Koch, the government delegate on the Covid-19 pandemic, warned residents to keep their guard up. “The increase in infections is not as steeply as feared, thank God. But we’re a long way from being out of the danger zone. There is a real risk that more people become infected and that we have additional hospitalisations,” Koch told a news conference on Friday. Currently there are about 300 patients in intensive care, Koch added. The government on Thursday presented details of a three-phased exit strategy from the sweeping restrictions gradually introduced since the end of February. Koch reiterated that hygiene and social distancing rules had to remain in place to ensure that the pandemic can be contained. The government is due to present further details on easing the lockdown, while different sectors of the industry were asked to issue safety concepts notably for hairdressers, beauty salons and other select businesses to reopen. Small and medium-sized companies as well as the restaurant sector have criticised the government delaying the re-opening until June at the earliest. The hospitality sector has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak. In total, more than 167,000 companies representing 1.76 million people, have applied for short-work hour unemployment benefits. That is about 25% of the total workforce in Switzerland.

2020-04-17;Swiss work habits: home office and more flexibility;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/diverse-picture_swiss-work-habits--home-office-and-more-flexibility/45697498;Statistics for 2019 show that working from home has already become a common practice in Switzerland, while flexible working hours are also on the rise. Home office was practiced by 33.7% of workers in Switzerland last year – 5% all the time, 14% regularly, and 15% occasionally. The sectors most concerned were teaching and information and communication, with over 60% of employees from these areas working from home at least once over the year. Various other shifts in Swiss workplace habits were also recorded, compared to the situation a decade ago, reportedExternal link the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) on Friday. Flexible working hours – i.e. the ability to determine when you start and end your day – were on the up: 46.2% enjoyed the luxury, a rise of 5.3% from 2010. The finance and insurance and information and communication sectors were most flexible, while the hotel-restaurant, health and social services, and construction sectors were least flexible. Weekend working, meanwhile, is becoming less common. Almost one-fifth of Swiss workers regularly worked Saturdays in 2019, one-tenth Sundays – a drop of 3.6 and 1.5 percentage points respectively. Agriculture, forestry, and the hospitality sectors were most weekend-intensive. Other ‘unsociable’ hours were also slightly less common than before, with 16.5% regularly working between 7pm and midnight, and 4.6% working night shifts. Women were slightly over-represented in the former, men in the latter. As for types of contract, 7.7% of workers had a fixed-term contract in 2019, a percentage point higher than in 2010. Here, the youngest and oldest workers were mainly concerned, as they also were when it came to working weekends and non-family-friendly hours, and in jobs demanding on-call hours. As for the figures for how work practices have shifted since the onset of the coronavirus, the FSO says that it will publish in September the statistics for the first half of 2020.

2020-04-17;Easing of Covid-19 restrictions highlights mask shortage;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-health-policy_easing-of-covid-19-restrictions-highlights-mask-shortage/45696986;The Swiss government says it is doing everything it can to procure face masks, which are still not officially recommended for healthy members of the public. But as businesses slowly prepare to reopen, the key role of masks in the government’s coronavirus health policy is becoming clear.  Health Minister Alain Berset admitted on Thursday that Switzerland had been caught napping when it came to having enough masks to go around. While it is not required of the federal government to maintain stocks of masks for the entire population, Switzerland’s pandemic plan does require health institutions to have reserves of essential equipment, including masks. It is the responsibility of the country’s 26 cantons to enforce this.   “In retrospect, it can be said that very many institutions and facilities did not have these reserves,” Berset told Swiss public broadcaster, SRFExternal link.  He said the government was doing everything it could to make up for the shortfall of masks. Earlier the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported that the Swiss army had been tasked with procuring 400 million masks by the end of May. Swiss International Air Lines announced that ten cargo flights from China would bring in over 35 million items of personal protection equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves and safety glasses. Who is meant to wear them?  “We must not forget that wearing masks is still not recommended for a healthy person on the street,” said Berset. Only healthcare workers and sick people are obliged to wear masks, he said.   However, the easing of coronavirus-related restrictionsExternal link from April 27 is likely to complicate matters. According to online publisher WatsonExternal link, Berset admitted that hairdressers and beauty salons would probably make wearing masks compulsory when they reopen in ten days, and so could DIY stores, garden centres and florists. Will they provide customers with masks?  Businesses are starting to plan for this. The Swiss Association of Hairdressers has created a digital platform to allow members to place orders for masks directly with suppliers. Another option is letting shoppers improvise. The Association of Swiss Subsidiary Companies has proposed that self-sewn masks and face coverings should be allowed as a fall-back option. And Swiss manufacturers, such as this textile company, are starting to make masks domestically.  The fact is that there are not enough masks to go around even for those on the frontline of the battle against Covid-19.   The PharmaSuisse association of pharmacists has stated that not only are there not enough to meet customer demand, but many pharmacies and drugstores even lack masks for their own use. It is also unlikely that Swiss residents can buy masks in supermarkets any time soon. Aldi Switzerland said it was planning to include masks in its range temporarily, but it was not yet clear when this would happen.  According to the Tages-AnzeigerExternal link, it is hardly surprising that Swiss ministers squirm when asked about the benefits of protective masks. “There are simply not enough masks at the moment, and the government is merely adapting its communication to the prevailing shortage,” it said.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The concerts, featuring a line-up including Lionel Richie and Lenny Kravitz, were set to have been staged on the shores of Lake Geneva from July 3-18, “The programme planned for this summer will be partly carried over to next year’s festival, which will take place from 2 to 17 July 2021,” the organisers wroteExternal link in a statement. Despite the government’s announcement yesterday of a three-stage plan to loosen anti-Covid-19 measures in the coming weeks and months, the fact that hygiene and social distancing measures remain in place mean such a large-scale event was not possible, they said. The two-week “Rolls-Royce” of international music festivals, which was launched in 1967, draws some 250,000 people each year. Last year, the diverse line-up of acts featured Elton John, Sting, Janet Jackson, Chick Corea, and Thom Yorke.

2020-04-17;Covid-19 tracking: Knowing where you are without knowing who you are;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_covid-19-tracking--knowing-where-you-are-without-knowing-who-you-are/45696340;"Many governments in western democracies wish to use our mobile phones to track social-distancing compliance during the coronavirus pandemic. William H. Hampton of the TechX LabExternal link at the University of St Gallen explains how the authorities can get the information they need while minimising invasions of personal privacy.  One of the goals of our research lab is to understand how technology can be used to better understand and improve peoples’ lives. In our studies we often collect mobile data, including mobile tracking information, and in the process have learned much about the advantages and downfalls of this emerging technology.  The world's governments have also been examining mobile phone dataExternal link, with a timely goal of tracking compliance with Covid-19 mandates. In contrast to our studies, in which we obtain informed consent, governments have been tracking populations at large and without notice—sparking concerns of privacy violations. Some have argued obtaining these geo-specific compliance data has been invaluable in guiding health policy action. They argue that by knowing that a certain area is non-compliant, we can predict with some accuracy that that area will be more likely to see a spike in cases and take critical early steps to address the anticipated surge in infections.  Despite these potential advantages, not everyone has been welcoming of Covid-19 mobile tracking. Individuals and privacy watchdogs have voiced concerns that allowing such tracking may be a step down a slippery slope toward an Orwellian future in which the government permanently and pervasively tracks our every move. This sentiment is part of a larger ongoing discourse about digital rights and related movements championing the right to privacy. To assess the pros and cons of using mobile data as a tool to aid disease tracking, it is important to first understand how mobile tracking works in the first place.  Contemporary mobile smart phones contain hundreds of sensors, some of which are well-known such as microphones, cameras, and global position systems (GPS). Others are less conspicuous and include Bluetooth modules, accelerometers, gyroscopes, proximity sensors, and ambient light detectors. Although governments have not explicitly disclosed which sensor data they have been monitoring, we can infer from public statements that they have been examining GPS data.  Your mobile phone contains a GPS chip that communicates with satellites, often integrating this data with other information from cellular base stations and WiFi networks to triangulate your location to within about 5 m (16 ft).  For the Covid-19 pandemic, governments have used GPS data to estimate adherence to Covid-19 travel guidelines. Not surprisingly, some have objected to having their location tracked without consent. The governmental entities engaging in GPS tracking have largely eschewed such complaints, arguing that they anonymise data. Yet none have specified how data are anonymised. This is troubling as location data can be difficult to make truly anonymous.  Imagine that your house is over 50 m from any other house; because your phone detects your location to within 5 m, your GPS location would essentially be interchangeable with your street and house number. Scrubbing your name from such GPS data might therefore be no more effective in protecting your identity than removing your name from your mailbox at the end of your driveway. New research has also shown that because movement data is highly unique—comparable to a fingerprint— such that even individuals in densely-populated urban areas could theoretically be readily identified.  Next, to track congregation behaviour or more subtle interpersonal physical distancing, our studies suggest that governments might look to mobile Bluetooth data. You may know Bluetooth as the technology that allows you to listen to your music with wireless headphones or speedily transfer a video to a friend. You may not know, however, that Bluetooth also regularly checks your vicinity for other Bluetooth devices, tucking the results of these checks away in timestamped log files in your mobile. Your phone can therefore “sense” how many other phones are in the vicinity, as well as how far away they are by measuring the signal strength between any two devices (stronger signal in most cases indicates less distance). In this way, in the days after issuing a distancing mandate, agencies would be hoping to see your phone detect fewer devices and with weaker signals as an indication that you are following the rules.  So far no government has admitted to using Bluetooth data, but the UK's National Health Service announced it is developing an opt-in appExternal link that will leverage Bluetooth sensor technology.  Remember that both GPS and Bluetooth chips can easily be deactivated in your mobile system settings. In this sense, any individual is free to ‘opt-out’ of all such tracking, though many users might miss the associated mapping and transfer functions.  So how can governments get the information that they need to track disease and make policy decisions that could save lives while minimising invasions of personal privacy?  First, they can be much more transparent about their mobile tracking programmes. The more we know about what information they are collecting and how it is being anonymised and analysed, the better we can evaluate the ethical and legal implications of their actions. Second, it might be best to give governments access to only aggregated mobile tracking data. As the name implies, aggregated data only provides information at the group level, as a kind of summary, not per individual. This is what Google has done with their Covid-19 Community Mobility ReportsExternal link, which notably will only be accessible for a limited period during the pandemic. In theory, this should allow governments information that they need, without providing tracking data on any single person. From a privacy perspective, this approach would be far superior to simply “de-identifying” data (for example switching a name for a random number), which does not lead to true anonymisation.  Ultimately, as with any new technology, it is how we use it that matters. As Noam Chomsky eloquently put it, technology is “like a hammer, which can be used to build a house or to destroy someone’s home. The hammer doesn’t care. It is almost always up to us to determine whether the technology is good or bad.” We hope to see governments using mobile tracking to hammer the spread of viruses, and not to shatter our personal privacy.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-04-17;This test could help Switzerland get back on track;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-antibodies-_this-test-could-help-switzerland-get-back-on-track/45694550;"Scientists agree that it will take many months to find a vaccine for the deadly new coronavirus. Yet politicians desperately need answers so citizens can return to their daily lives as soon as possible. A solution could lie with serological tests, which should be ready in Switzerland by the end of this month. While we wait for a vaccine or treatment to fight Covid-19, scientists are developing tests to tell us how widespread the virus is. One option, in addition to screening, is the serological test. Our body fights infectious diseases thanks to our immune system. We produce antibodies in response to external agents, which then, hopefully, confront and eradicate them. After defeating an infectious disease, our body conserves a “memory” of the virus that attacked us so we can fight it better and faster if we are re-infected. This “memory” is the antibodies, and result is immunity - though in the case of Covid-19, it’s unclear how long that immunity lasts, as the government’s delegate on the Covid-19 pandemic Daniel Koch pointed out at a press conference on Thursday.  Serological testing can detect the presence of antibodies in the blood, in order to understand whether someone has already had Covid-19 and is immune. The results can help political decision-makers in the coming weeks and months as they analyse whether to continue to restrict individuals’ fundamental rights and when it’s safe to restart the country and economy. Serological tests are being developed in laboratories around the world in a race against time. Switzerland, which is at the forefront of biomedical research, is also investing resources to meet the challenge.   Various tests are already on the market, with the best ones being around 85-90% reliable. Others are currently announced as in development, including by pharma giant Roche, who said on Friday that it plans to have tests ready by early May, and then ramp up production to “high double-digit millions” by June. Giuseppe Togni, scientific director of the Unilabs central laboratory in Coppet, canton Vaud, says the problem is the lack of data.  “Reliability is essential with this type of test. In our laboratories, we have currently managed to achieve a reliability of 99%. But this is not enough. We have to be 100% sure. It would be dangerous for anyone to feel safe based on a bad test.”   Togni, who heads up an international task force on the issue, expects that 100% reliability will be achieved in the coming weeks.    “Up until a few days ago, I would not have dared to suggest a timeframe,” he says. “But in view of the results, I am very confident. A reliable serological test will be ready by the end of April.” In the race to develop a test, Togni's team is working with the universities of Geneva and Zurich.  Monitoring antibodies is essential, but scientists must also determine whether antibodies allow immunity to develop.   “The important thing is to know whether these antibodies are ‘neutralising’ or not,” explains Togni.  There are protective antibodies, which once developed mean you are immune to the disease, but there are also antibodies that are not protective, such as the ones that fight AIDS.  At present, it is still too early to label these antibodies as neutralising. “There are no definitive studies yet. Based on our experience, these antibodies should be protective because Covid-19 is very similar to other coronaviruses we already know,” says the researcher.   If Covid-19 does behave like those other viruses, it means those who have recovered from the infection will be protected regardless of whether they developed symptoms. If we can identify people who are definitely immune, they could return to work, thereby minimising the risk of contagion.   “But this is not the question we should be asking ourselves; we have to ask ourselves who these tests are for,” argues Togni. “There is no point in testing the whole population. In Ticino, for example, according to reliable studies, between 5-10% of people are infected. It would make no sense to test everyone.”  So, who should be tested first? The researcher is convinced: “The healthcare staff. Then, people working in other essential professions. Then we can consider extending the tests to other sectors.”   But he warns against long-term testing discrimination. “During this period, we have witnessed great solidarity between people and especially between generations. If we start to choose who can and cannot take the test, this solidarity will inevitably disappear.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Shops stocking goods other than essential everyday items in their stores may then resume selling these too,” the government stated. Measures that currently restrict funeral services to immediate family will also be lifted during this phase. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the government chose a cautious Covid-19 exit strategy. We want to proceed as swiftly as possible and as slowly as necessary, he said. We have to avoid a stop-and-go policy. On April 29, the government will make a decision on whether to proceed with stage two of the measures. This involves the re-opening of compulsory education schools on May 11, followed by higher education facilities and other public buildings on June 8. “Moving from one phase to the next depends on there being no significant increase in Covid-19 cases. Sufficient time has to be allowed between each phase so that the effects can be observed. The criteria are the number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths, and hospital occupancy rates,” the government stated. The ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people remains in place, as well as the hygiene recommendations, said Berset. Preparations are underway for the public transport companies to resume regular services. The government is also considering options for organisers of mass events, notably music festivals, sports competitions as well as political rallies.  Details are expected to be announced at the end of the month. A first set of restrictions was imposed by the government at the end of February and the measures were gradually tightened. Schools and non-essential businesses have been forced to close their doors since March 23, a measure that was later extended until April 26. The government said that high-risk people would not be forced to return to work immediately. Companies have a duty to protect such workers. Cantons will continue to trace and isolate infected people to prevent further transmissions.  “To this end, an extended testing strategy, a contact tracing concept and an app providing information about contacts with infected persons will be developed.” Meanwhile, the government has decided to grant financial benefits for single business ventures as part of a major relief package to prevent unemployment. The move follows political pressure over the past few weeks. It is expected to cost CHF1.3 billion ($1.4 billion). An additional CHF20 million have been earmarked for a special Covid-19 research project, Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said.  The government has already pledged CHF42 billion in financial support, including loans and a short-time unemployment benefits.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-16;Bankruptcy laws eased for Covid-affected companies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/debt-relief_bankruptcy-laws-eased-for-covid-affected-companies/45694796;The Swiss government has thrown a lifeline to businesses that are threatened with bankruptcy during the pandemic lockdown. Firms can delay declaring their financial difficulties to the courts, with smaller companies being given at least three months’ grace to pay off their debts. The measures have been announced to save firms going under with a resultant loss of jobs. Non-essential businesses have been forced to close their doors for several weeks as part of a government plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The Swiss state has provided more than CHF60 billion in the form of bridging loans, paying the wages of workers on shortened hours and cash injections into specific industries. But many companies are still struggling to make ends meet with their business effectively shut down. For this reason, the government introduced on Thursday further measures to ease bankruptcy proceedings. Companies must show they were in good health at the end of 2019, that their financial difficulties were caused by the pandemic, and that there is a reasonable chance business can be resumed when the restrictions are lifted. If these criteria can be met, then the normal obligation to file for insolvency can be temporarily lifted. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will also be given an extra three months to pay off their debts – a period that could be extended to six months on application. However, this does not excuse companies from paying the wages of employees. The government had previously decided not to extend a general debt payment amnesty beyond April 20, fearing this would encourage firms to default on debts.

The act of shopping itself was not being sanctioned, it pointed out, but rather the burden on resources that shopping trips create for customs agents.  Travellers who are not entitled to enter Switzerland according to the Covid-19 OrdinanceExternal link are not subject to a fine, the government added, seeking to clarify the measures currently in place.  The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) has received thousands of complaints and questionsExternal link in recent weeks from a confused public. Media reportsExternal link have revealed cases of parents with visiting rights in neighbouring countries and those caring for elderly relatives across the border being fined upon re-entry into Switzerland.   The government reiterated that under the ordinance, Swiss citizens and those with a valid residence permit are allowed to enter the country, regardless of the purpose of travel. Foreign nationals without a residence permit are not entitled to entry, except under situations of absolute necessity, which have now been clarified.  They include those who are travelling to care for elderly or sick relatives, parents living separately who hold visiting rights, those travelling for urgent business purposes, and those who are undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland or abroad.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The Swiss planet-spotting technology has now been declared fully functional and fit to undertake the three-year mission to study exoplanets. The telescope is travelling on board the satellite CHEOPSExternal link (CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite) as part of a joint mission with the European Space Agency (ESA) and Switzerland, led by the University of Bern, in collaboration with the University of Geneva. The testing phase was carried out without a hitch, despite team members being forced to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, the project announced on ThursdayExternal link. Much of the testing concentrated on the HD 88111 star located in the Hydra constellation, some 175 light years away from Earth, and the HD 93396 planetary system in the Sextans constellation, some 320 light years away. “ESA has handed over the responsibility to operate CHEOPS to the mission consortium, which consists of scientists and engineers from approximately 30 institutions in 11 European countries,” read a statement. In February, the CHEOPS telescope produced its first images, which exceeded expectations of quality. During its three-year mission, the CHEOPS satellite will study 100 of the more than 4,000 exoplanets – planets which exist outside the solar system – discovered so far. Astronomers are keen to find out more about their composition, information that may help them to better understand the origins of planet Earth and conditions for extraterrestrial life.

2020-04-16;Swiss media slam Trump’s WHO funding freeze;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-media-slam-trump-s-who-funding-freeze/45694208;US President Donald Trump’s decision to halt funding to the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) is “an own goal in a class of its own” and “a distraction from his own failings”, according to Swiss newspapers.  “First it was the Democrats in opposition, whom Donald Trump accused of distorting his management of the pandemic to discredit him in the eyes of the Americans,” wroteExternal link the Tribune de Genève.  “Then it was Barack Obama, who had apparently bequeathed him a totally obsolete infrastructure for fighting infectious diseases. Then there was China, which allegedly misled him. Then there were the New York hospital employees who, according to the president, stole protective masks. Then the governors who dared criticise him. And finally the media, who, according to his reading of their coverage of the disaster, had minimised the scale of the epidemic.”  Trump’s scapegoats have evolved over the weeks, the paper said. “On Tuesday it was the turn of the World Health Organization to bear the brunt of White House excuses.” Trump, who has reacted angrily to accusations his administration’s response to the worst epidemic in a century has been haphazard and slow, had become increasingly hostile towards the UN agency before announcing the halt on Tuesday.  He accuses the WHO of severely mismanaging the pandemic and covering up its spread. He also criticises its relationship with China and said it must be held accountable. The United States is the biggest overall donor to the WHO, contributing more than $400 million (CHF387 million) last year, roughly 15% of the organisation’s budget.  The Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) said Trump’s move to freeze funding while his administration carries out a 60-90 day review of the WHO response was “an own goal in a class of its own”, opening the door for Chinese influence in the UN.  “Trump complains that the WHO pays too much attention to Beijing’s concerns. By weakening the Geneva-based organisation in its biggest health crisis since its creation, he’s basically inviting China to expand its influence further,” it wroteExternal link.  While the NZZ said China’s engagement in multilateral forums was generally to be welcomed, the problem was that the values of the Communist Party clashed with those of the UN, notably on human rights.  “The leading role in the democratic camp was long held by the United States. Trump has waved goodbye to that.”  Le Temps in Lausanne added in its editorialExternal link that Washington was terrified of the Chinese desire to rewrite international standards, “but the two powers are playing a different game: Beijing is in it for the long term, while Trump wants to snuff out his administration’s fiasco dealing with Covid-19 as quickly as possible by making an easy scapegoat – to preserve his chances of re-election in November”.  It said Trump’s decision was “a huge wake-up call for International Geneva and multilateralism. Above all, it’s very bad news on the global health front as the world fights a devastating pandemic”.  The Tages-Anzeiger in Zurich agreedExternal link that Trump had found a scapegoat and he “clearly wants to distract from his own failings”.  The United States is the world’s worst-affected country and its coronavirus death toll topped 30,000 on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally. The fatalities have doubled in just a week and set a record single-day increase for the second day in a row.  Not that the WHO is perfect. The NZZ pointed to the funding structure – a mixture of voluntary funding and assessed contributions based on a country’s wealth and population. Around three-quarters of US funding was voluntary for 2018-2019.  “Those who know the WHO have long criticised the organisation for being too dependent on voluntary contributions which are often tied to specific projects,” the NZZ said.  “This makes it vulnerable to influence from member countries, but also from foundations and private companies. Trump illustrates the problem with his sledgehammer method: if he cancels voluntary contributions to the WHO, the decision of a single man will bring entire programmes for world health to a standstill.”  The paper pointed out that China currently pays fewer voluntary contributions to the WHO than Switzerland and Beijing will hardly be asked twice to fill the vacuum created by the US standing aside.  “Other democratic countries would do well to step into the breach first,” it said. “The coronavirus pandemic shows that the world needs a strong and transparent guardian of global health. To achieve this, the WHO must be reformed and improved. But in order for it to be able to fulfil its tasks, it needs stable funding that is not dependent on the whims of individual politicians.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-16;Beijing’s long arm reaches into small Swiss villages;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/china-s-sharp-power_beijing-s-long-arm-reaches-into-small-swiss-villages/45691732;China’s coronavirus aid for Europe has raised the question of whether the country is using the pandemic to build influence in the West. Yet many other, more direct, interventions from Beijing go virtually unnoticed, such as events in southwestern Switzerland last month. On March 9, ten municipalities in the French-speaking canton of Vaud received post from the cantonal government. They all planned to take part in a flag-flying campaign for Tibet organized annually by the Swiss-Tibetan Friendship Society (GSTF) to commemorate the 1959 Tibetan uprising against the Chinese occupiers. The letter from the Vaud government, obtained by swissinfo.ch, urged the municipalities to abstain from raising the Tibetan flag on March 10. It would contradict the “One China Policy” of the Swiss government, the cantonal government said, referring to consultations with the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. Foreign policy is a matter for the federal government, it said. Three days earlier, the Chinese ambassador had written to the government of canton Vaud asking it to call on the municipalities to desist from raising flags and other demonstrations of solidarity. There is nothing new about the Chinese Embassy trying to disrupt or prevent such demonstrations, says GSTF president Thomas Büchli. The embassy often contacts an official institution in writing or by telephone. Sometimes, officials even receive personal visits at their offices. “What is new, however, is that the relevant authority responded to Chinese intervention by writing an official letter that simply passed on the request,” Büchli says. Asked why it passed on the demand from the Chinese Embassy, the cantonal government said all it had done was to share the position of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. Nine municipalities went ahead regardless and raised the Tibetan flag on March 10, while one desisted. 'Small scandals shows patterns' Ralph Weber, a professor at the Europa Institute at Basel University, researches Chinese politics and documents this kind of Chinese intervention. His aim is to understand how authoritarian regimes try to influence democratic states. “These kinds of intervention by China happen constantly all over Europe,” he says, noting that most of the time it’s a question of small scandals that are often not even registered by the public.  “Taken together, you start to recognise certain patterns.” These patterns can be traced back to the activities of the so-called United Front, Weber says. The United Front is an organisation inside the Chinese Communist Party that has gained considerable influence since President Xi Jinping took office eight years ago. One of its tasks is to manipulate foreign institutions to promote China’s interests abroad. President Xi declared officially in 2013 that China’s stories must be “well told . Xi’s appeal targeted foreign countries, Weber notes. “Under Xi, China has increased its influence abroad considerably. It’s about soft power, but also about what we in academia refer to as sharp power.” Tibetan flags In Beijing’s view, Tibetan flags in Swiss municipalities are not the way to tell good stories. So this is a case for the United Front, which operates abroad not only via embassies and consulates. Weber says China also has “a host of associations which act like non-governmental organisations . These make contact with civil society, with towns or municipalities and try to engage private people and entrepreneurs to work for their interests. “In Switzerland we underestimate the scope and depth of the United Front’s activities,” says the Basel-based researcher. In other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand or Czech Republic, there is a much more intensive and critical discussion about China’s influence, he says. Weber is not the only one who doubts federal politicians in Bern are up to speed on all of these activities. Fabian Molina, a member of parliament from the left-wing Social Democrat party, put forward a motion urging the government to “develop a coherent foreign policy strategy for China . He says it is the only way for Switzerland to protect its interests and values from Beijing. China 2020 strategy The government recommended taking up the motion and the lower house of parliament followed this recommendation, but the senate rejected it at the end of 2019. However, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs says that China is currently the subject of “in-depth analysis . This is also one of the aims of the new Foreign Policy Strategy for 2020-2023. In the second half of the year, this work should be completed, the Foreign Affairs Ministry reports. The goal of the work is “more coherence between departments . The government wants “to create clearly established decision-making mechanisms which are activated in cases of conflicting priorities . Molina is happy “that now at last something is happening . But he says the steps taken so far are inadequate because they only apply to national institutions. “It would make more sense to include all of Switzerland and provide orientation for cantons, towns and municipalities,” the lawmaker says. The latest example in canton Vaud shows that it’s not enough for the departments in Bern to reach agreement among themselves, Molina says.  “China will exploit Switzerland’s federal structure.

2020-04-16;Swiss army recruited to ensure supply of medical masks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-measures_swiss-army-recruited-to-ensure-supply-of-medical-masks/45693996;The Swiss army has been given an CHF800 million ($830 million) mandate to locate and import medical supplies, such as face masks, during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a newspaper report. The Tages AnzeigerExternal link newspaper says the decision to bring in military procurement support was taken by the government in mid-March, around the time it ordered a nationwide shutdown of schools and non-essential businesses. According to the newspaper, one of the priorities is to bring up to 400 million medical masks to Switzerland by the end of May. Swiss International Air Lines, which has already been transporting medical supplies from China in recent weeks, would likely be part of the exercise. China is the probable source of much of the medical material that Switzerland will need in the coming months, the media report states. Despite some Swiss companies turning their efforts towards producing medical equipment, such as masks, there is a current shortage in the country, reports Swiss public broadcasterExternal link SRF. On Thursday, government ministers will outline how the country will gradually relax lockdown measures over the coming weeks. Media reports say a three-stage plan will be presented to restore normal activities. Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga had earlier said the easing of emergency measures may be accompanied by other precautions, such as a demand for people to wear face masks in public. Should this be the case, the Tages Anzeiger predicts in its report that some 400 million masks will need to be imported.

2020-04-16;Liechtenstein rolls out radical Covid-19 bracelet programme;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_liechtenstein-rolls-out-radical-covid-19-bracelet-programme/45693872;The principality of Liechtenstein is piloting a programme to fit its citizens with biometric bracelets in a radical new drive to track the emergence of potential cases of Covid-19 in real time. On Thursday, one in 20 Liechtensteiners will be offered the bracelets, which will send data on vital bodily metrics including skin temperature, breathing rate and heart rate back to a Swiss laboratory for analysis.  In a second phase, which will begin in the autumn, bracelets will be offered to the whole population, Liechtenstein’s minister for social affairs, Mauro Pedrazzini, told the Financial Times.  Though the bracelet scheme is limited in scale to the 38,000 people who claim citizenship of Liechtenstein, it marks a significant departure from existing global efforts to trace the spread of the disease. It is also likely to add to growing controversy in the west over the ethical boundaries between public health and personal data, as governments race to arm themselves with information on the health of their populations. “This is science, and there is no guarantee [the theory] will work, but it is probable that it could work very well,” said Mr Pedrazzini. “What we and other governments need are early warning systems to deal with this crisis.”  The ultra-wealthy alpine statelet has so far recorded just 80 cases of the novel coronavirus, but its government has aggressively instituted preventive measures to pre-empt future infections and test its population.  All front-line workers in Liechtenstein who come into contact with vulnerable and high-risk people are to receive weekly coronavirus tests, while this week equipment was installed to monitor the country’s entire sewage output for coronavirus signifiers, in order to alert authorities to the presence of infected persons within the country’s borders. Liechtenstein’s public health authorities anticipate a second wave of infections this autumn, said Mr Pedrazzini. They hope that data collected from the first tranche of 2,000 bracelets in the coming months will enable them to calibrate algorithms to detect the exact pattern of subtle changes in individuals’ physiology that will identify likely cases of Covid-19, even before symptoms might manifest themselves. A second, wider national rollout of bracelets would then allow individuals in the principality to be rapidly contacted, tested and — if confirmed as infected — isolated and treated in a highly targeted manner.  Any measures that help to rapidly diagnose and trace future coronavirus cases will be essential tools in allowing governments across the world to balance public health with the urgent need to restart economies in the coming months, said Mr Pedrazzini. The project was the creation of Lorenz Risch, president of Switzerland’s Dr Risch Laboratories, which is already conducting a longitudinal clinical study of 2,000 people in Liechtenstein. The bracelets for the project will be supplied by Ava, a Swiss medical technology company which currently sells them internationally as an aid for women to accurately monitor their fertility cycles. The costs of the project will be underwritten directly by the princely house of Liechtenstein.  Mr Pedrazzini said the Liechtenstein government was committed to protecting the data privacy of participants in the initial study, which has been given an ethical audit by Swiss health authorities, and the subsequent rollout to the broader population of the principality.  “People will have to declare their willingness to give up this data,” he said, which would only be used for narrow purposes to combat the coronavirus epidemic.

2020-04-15;Funding the World Health Organization: where the US money goes;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/global-health_funding-the-world-health-organization--where-the-us-money-goes/45691366;The United States has temporarily suspended its funding to the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Here is a look at most recent US contributions to the UN health agency and how the money was spent. US President Donald Trump announced on April 14 that US contributions to the WHO would be frozen while his administration carried out a review of the organisation’s response to the pandemic. The review was likely to take 60-90 days, he said.  The US decision has sparked condemnation by numerous health experts and leaders, such as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he regretted Trump's decision but called on world unity to fight the pandemic. The United States of America has been a long-standing and generous friend of the WHO and we hope it will continue to be so, Tedros told a press conference on Wednesday. We regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in the funding to the WHO. WHO was still examining the impact and would try to fill any gaps with partners , Tedros said. Trump had accused the WHO of severely mismanaging the pandemic and covering up its spread. He also criticised its relationship with China and said the UN agency must be held accountable. The halt to US funding, if it became permanent, would leave a huge hole in the WHO’s finances. The US is the biggest overall donor to the UN health agency, contributing roughly 15%External link of its $5.6 billion (CHF5.4 billion) budget for 2018-2019.  The WHO is financed through a mix of assessed contributions – dues countries pay in order to be a WHO member – and voluntary funding. Just over a quarter of US contributions for 2018-2019, or $237 million, were assessed. The amount a member state must pay is calculated on a sliding scale relative to the country’s wealth and population. For 2018-2019 the US also gave $656 million in voluntary funding, earmarked to specific programmes or countries (see below). In recent years, assessed contributions to the health agency have declined and voluntary contributions from a range of sources, public and private, have accounted for more than three-quarters of the WHO’s financing.  Here is an overview of the top ten donors to the WHO for 2018-2019. The WHO’s polio eradication programmesExternal link received the largest chunk of earmarked US money for 2018-2019 ($158 million, or almost 30% of its entire voluntary funding during that period).  Polio-related work in Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia received the lion’s share of the money. The US gave $100 million to the WHO’s work supporting community health programmes, primary health care, ambulance services and hospitals and other tertiary care facilitiesExternal link, mainly in Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan, in this time period.  It also gave $44 million to the WHO’s vaccines and preventable diseases operationsExternal link around the world, helping countries implement vaccination plans to eliminate and control diseases such as measles, rubella and hepatitis B. An additional $33 million went to work on tuberculosisExternal link.                           For 2018-2019, Switzerland gave the organisation $38.8 million – $10.9 million in assessed contributions and $27.9 million in voluntary contributions. Of this $4.4 million was spent on tropical disease research, $3.1 million on research into human reproduction and $2.2 million on national health policies and strategies.

2020-04-15; Pandemic takes a heavy toll on consumer confidence ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-_-pandemic-takes-a-heavy-toll-on-consumer-confidence-/45690900;Switzerland’s consumer confidence index plummeted to a “historically low” level in April, according to a Wednesday statement from the Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).  The index fell to -40 points, compared to -9 points in January, when the previous survey was conducted. That marks the lowest results since the early 1990s.  These results are provisional and are published exceptionally, SECO notedExternal link.  Household expectations regarding the development of the economic situation have deteriorated significantly since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The corresponding sub-index plummeted to -84 points.  Respondents are also pessimistic about their own budgetary situation. The indicator relating to future financial situation also dropped to a historic low (-24 points).  Survey participants indicated that it is not the right time to make big acquisitions (-48 points).  These responses reflect, on the one hand, the impact of the closure of many businesses in the context of the extraordinary situation and, on the other hand, the very great uncertainty that currently prevails , the office stated.  ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-15;Extreme winters in Switzerland are becoming more frequent;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/climate-change_extreme-winters-in-switzerland-are-becoming-more-frequent/45691658;"As coronavirus continues its devastation, it is easy to lose sight of the major crisis before the pandemic: climate change. We delve into the official temperature figures to show how this winter became the warmest on record in Switzerland.    This animated map shows how winter temperatures (metereological winter, December to February) have been developing on average in the three different climate zones of Switzerland over the last 155 years. The Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology, known as MeteoSwiss, divides Switzerland into three climate regions: north of the Alps and lower than 1,000 metres above sea level (MASL); north of the Alps and higher than 1,000 MASL and south of the Alps. In 2020, the national average winter temperature rose to 0.7°C. Extreme winter temperatures, with a national average of over 0ºC, have only occurred four times since temperature records began in 1864. Extremely warm winters like these are a phenomenon of the last 30 years, when the average Swiss winter temperature was just under -2°C.At the same time, cold winters with temperatures well below -4°C seem to have disappeared from Switzerland's current climate. Comparing the pre-industrial period of 1871-1900 to the current period of 1991-2020, Swiss winters have become almost 2°C milder. In their 2019/2020 climate bulletinExternal link MeteoSwiss infers that the increase in the standard winter temperature, the extreme winters above 0°C and the disappearance of really cold winters are clear signals of ongoing climate change.

2020-04-15;Donald Trump and the WHO: predictable but precarious;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_donald-trump-and-the-who--predictable-but-precarious/45691332;"Should we be surprised at US President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend funding for the World Health Organization (WHO)? Not at all. It’s part of an attempt to distract and grab power, and his administration’s track record of anti-multilateralism is well known. But that doesn’t make it easy to swallow. Justifying the suspension, Trump said the US would conduct a review to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”. Last year the United States contributed over $500 million (CHF482 million) to the WHO’s $6 billion budget. The suspension comes at a most sensitive time for the UN’s lead agency against the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump is trying to blame the WHO for many of his own mistakes in fighting the virus. Although he was personally warned about the possibilities of a pandemic early on and his transition team had had a briefing on the possibility of future pandemics before his inauguration, Trump hesitated in taking concrete action. (He is right, however, in blaming the UN agency for hesitating to declare a pandemic due to Chinese pressure.)  Typically Trump, he is looking for someone else to blame for his mistakes. And when asked about his authority versus those of governors to make decisions about reopening businesses and schools, Trump declared: “When somebody’s president of the United States, the authority is total.   He has been rightly criticized for claiming “total authority.” The American Constitution, much like the Swiss, has clear separation of powers. President Trump cannot order the states to do whatever he wants, just as the Federal Council has limited power over cantonal governments in Switzerland. And that’s exactly what infuriates the American president about multilateralism. He cannot do whatever he wants. Multilateralism is based on consensus among several states. Although a state may have more influence than others, as the permanent five members of the UN Security Council have veto power at the UN, the foundation of multilateralism is give and take, something that is aberrant to the man who made his reputation singularly firing people on The Apprentice. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. Many celebrations have been scheduled, especially in Geneva. International Geneva is and has been the core of functioning multilateralism, and the United States has always been a leader and advocate for it, from Woodrow Wilson to the Reagan/Gorbachev summit to John Kerry’s work on the Iranian nuclear deal. The role of the United States in International Geneva cannot be underestimated.But following Trump’s inauguration, there was no United States ambassador to the Office of the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva for over two years. The current Ambassador, Andrew Bremberg, was previously part of the inner White House circle on domestic policy. His mentor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is no fan of multilateralism. Ultimately, what makes President Trump’s WHO funding cut so disheartening is not just its reversal of the United States’ traditional multilateral leadership and Geneva presence, but its tragic timing. Now is the time for unity and for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said recently, calling on countries not to hold back funding for UN agencies amid the crisis. Donald Trump has done just that at a moment when more cooperation is needed to fight crises like the pandemic. Given his track record, it was not a surprise; let other UN agencies be warned that more suspensions and/or withdrawals may be coming.

2020-04-15;Interest groups present demands for coronavirus exit plans;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lobbying_interest-groups-present-demands-for-coronavirus-exit-plans/45690984;Political parties, trade unions and other interest groups have published their proposals for the government to relax restrictions introduced to stem the Covid-19 pandemic. The calls come a day ahead of the government’s decision on a nationwide coronavirus exit strategy, notably a staggered resumption of business activities and the reopening of schools. The right-wing Swiss People’s Party demanded that the government give up its special powers by April 20, and that economic and social restrictions be lifted while ensuring the protection of vulnerable people. In a similar vein, the centre-right Radical Party, traditionally close to the business community, called for detailed exit scenarios in line with the health situation in the country. The think tank Avenir SuisseExternal link, which advocates a free market economy, wants the government to lift all restrictions by April 26, warning of a steep increase in unemployment and high costs for businesses if the curbs are upheld. Avenir Suisse also stressed the need to increase the testing of population on a broad scale and the respect of hygiene precautions. For its part, the Trade Union FederationExternal link has stressed the importance of preventive measures to secure jobs and to guarantee full salaries. The federation calls on the government to present proposals, including a waiver of health insurance premiums to help low-paid employees, as well as for those who can’t go to work because they have medical preconditions. In addition, the leading trade union umbrella group, wants additional state support for childcare facilities which were ordered to close in mid-March as well as one-person business ventures. Meanwhile, the Green Party is pushing for multi-billion economic stimulus package compatible with a sustainable and climate-friendly policy principles. The centrist Christian Democrats have called for a transparent information policy and more solidarity in Switzerland while a left-wing Social Democratic parliamentarian says rich countries like Switzerland have a responsibility to help developing countries cope with the Covid-19 pandemic.    The government pledged an economic relief programme to the tune of CHF42 billion ($43.6 billion). Parliament is due to meet in an extraordinary session next month to discuss the financial aid package. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-15;Prisoners in Switzerland stay behind bars despite coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/no-amnesty_prisoners-in-switzerland-stay-behind-bars-despite-coronavirus/45686672;Being stuck inside is not easy under the best of circumstances. Just look at all those people eager to go on hikes and do sports outside even though the government has told them to stay at home. For them, abiding by such restrictions is largely a voluntary exercise. Others, like the 7,000 inmates scattered across the prisons of Switzerland, have no choice. Their limited contact with the outside world has been further reduced as the authorities battle to get a grip on the health crisis. No visits, paroled absences, or sporting activities. No going to the workshop or the classroom. These are just some of the restrictions that have been introduced in the country’s prisons – with some variations depending on the canton – to safeguard the health of inmates and prison wardens. We are trying to avoid physical contact between inmates, maintain social distancing and avoid groupings of more than five people at a time – and in prison that’s easier said than done , said Franz Walter, head of the prison system in canton Fribourg, in an interview with the local newspaper Freiburger NachrichtenExternal link. In Ticino, one of the regions hardest hit by the coronavirus, inmates can no longer have any visits from family members, reports Stefano Laffranchini, head of prisons in the Italian-speaking canton. Apart from having a negative effect on their reintegration into society, this deprives them of a whole range of emotional supports and contacts which matter to them at a time like this , he told Swiss-Italian public radio. This restriction on privileges could lead to riots, the experts acknowledge. There are tensions and major problems involved in any kind of imprisonment, admits Denis Froidevaux, head of public security in canton Vaud in western Switzerland. The country has not witnessed any uprisings and jailbreaks, unlike Latin America, where large numbers were killed and wounded, or neighbouring Italy. Yet, the potential for violence and uprisings has increased , notes Walter. Last Friday, 43 inmates at the Champ-Dollon prison in Geneva refused to return to their cells after exercise time. This was repeated the next day, requring an intervention by the security forces but it did not result in any injuries. What happens within prison walls mirrors what is going on in society outside, notes Marcel Ruf, warden of the prison at Lenzburg in canton Aargau. Some are in favour of the steps taken, others think they are overdone. With no work and no visits, the situation inmates find themselves in is clearly not easy – especially for anyone who has a family , he told the newspaper Luzerner ZeitungExternal link. A prison’s concrete walls and metal gates do little to protect those inside from the coronavirus. The risk of contagion is highest at facilities that are already overcrowded. The Swiss prison has at least 35 known cases of coronavirus, 33 of them involving staff, according to judicial and prison authorities. In the absence of testing, the real number of infected persons could well be higher. If an inmate were to show mild symptoms, he would have to remain isolated in his cell. Anyone needing hospital care would be taken out of there,  says Laffranchini. People in the high-risk groups - one inmate in ten is over 65 – are isolated too. Although the present health crisis is an exceptional situation, the rights and freedoms of inmates need to be upheld as far as possible, say human rights advocates, who are calling for unconventional and creative approaches to ensuring the well-being of inmates and prison staff. The inmates have to spend more time in their cells and have less contact with other inmates. It’s double isolation. The freedoms of an inmate are already limited and so any restriction needs to be counterbalanced with compensatory measures, David Mühlemann, who specialises in issues concerning those deprived of their liberty at humanrights.chExternal link, told swissinfo.ch. To compensate for the loss of visits – the last little bit of freedom and the only way to have contact with the outside world – Mühlemann recommends using video conferencing. Exercise time needs to be maintained at all costs, he says. Social distancing needs to be respected, therefore it is necessary to reduce the prison population. The Swiss Criminal Code External link allows for parole for those who have served two-thirds of their sentence, but it often doesn’t happen, according to Mühlemann. Recourse to these approaches is more than ever necessary,” he says. “I would go further than that. Inmates who have served half their sentence and belong to the at-risk group should be paroled. In prison there are many young people with health problems. The same appeal is being made by Reform 91External link, an association assisting and advocating for inmates and marginalised individuals, which cites recommendations from the Council of Europe and the World Organisation against Torture. Jonas Weber, who is a professor of criminal law at Bern University, backs the idea of a general amnesty. The government, he told the Swiss-German magazine WochenzeitungExternal link could let all inmates off the last two months of their sentence. Although there is not much communication on the matter, some cantons are taking action, notes Mühlemann. There are prisons which have allotted more time for telephone calls and are looking at the possibility of allowing video-conferencing. At Champ-Dollon in Geneva, which is the most overcrowded prison in Switzerland, plexiglass partititions have been put up in the visiting area to ensure there can still be visits from family members. The number of inmates there recently dropped from 650 to 560 as alternatives to custodial sentences were found for some, notes Mühlemann. These alternatives include house arrest, electronic bracelets and an obligation to report to police. Some of the cantons have tried more unusual approaches. Bern has sent home 27 inmates who were in an open prison environment or in semi-detention because they belonged to at-risk groups. The Bern authorities have waived custodial sentences for individuals who are serving less than 30 days and are not considered a danger to society. Following the example of France, Britain, and the US – where prisoners have been released en masse – does not seem to be an option in Switzerland. Paroling an inmate after he serves half his sentence, just because he belongs to an at-risk group, is not legally feasible, according to Alain Hofer, deputy secretary-general of the Conference of Cantonal Justice and Police Directors, who was quoted in the newspaper 20 MinutenExternal link. Interruption of detention or release due to coronavirus, the group says, represents a measure of last resort. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-14;More high-profile brands desert the Baselworld fair;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/watch-makers_more-high-profile-brands-desert-the-baselworld-fair/45689338;Rolex, Patek Philippe and Chanel will not exhibit at the Baselworld watch and jewellery trade show in 2021. The announcement marks another blow to the event, which has already seen high-profile exits, including by the Swatch Group. The luxury timepiece companies, along with Chopard and Tudor said on Tuesday they would launch a new trade show in Geneva with the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie industry group, in April 2021. Rolex said it was unhappy with changes at Baselworld and recent decisions made by organiser MCH Group, which postponed the 2020 edition of Baselworld planned for April 30 - May 5 due to the coronavirus epidemic. MCH carried forward 85% of the fees for exhibitors to next year, while keeping 15% to offset out-of-pocket costs, among options it offered exhibitors as it sought to manage the financial impact. “We have taken part in Baselworld since 1939,” Rolex said in a joint statement with the other watch makers. “Unfortunately, given the way the event has evolved and the recent decisions made by MCH Group…we have decided to withdraw.” Geneva-based Patek Philippe cited a breakdown in relations with Baselworld organisers, saying the company “is not in line with Baselworld’s vision anymore” and that “trust is no longer present”. MCH Group, which last month predicted sales losses of up to 170 million francs ($177 million) for 2020 as the epidemic wreaks havoc on events, declined to comment. Swatch Group, the maker of Omega watches, left Baselworld in 2019, citing issues including costs. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-14;Swiss take aid to Africa as part of Covid repatriation flights;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/humanitarian-work_swiss-take-aid-to-africa-as-part-of-covid-repatriation-flights/45689024;Switzerland has delivered humanitarian supplies to the Democratic Republic of the Congo before repatriating tourists stranded in central Africa due to the coronavirus pandemic. On board the plane which flew to Kinshasa on Monday were 1.3 tonnes of medical goods as well as representatives of non-governmental organisations, according to Hans-Peter Lenz of the Swiss foreign ministry’s crisis unit. Some 200 passengers were then flown back to Switzerland following a major effort by the Swiss embassy in Kinshasa to organise special permits, Lenz told a news conference on Tuesday. So far, the government has repatriated more than 5,000 Swiss citizens as part of a historic operation to return stranded tourists from locations around the world over the past three weeks. Additional flights are scheduled later this and next week from Ukraine and Montenegro as well as from destinations in Asia and Latin America. Lenz reiterated that the foreign ministry is gradually phasing out its repatriation flights, but that Switzerland’s diplomatic representations will continue to deal with individual requests, including facilitating cooperation agreements with neighbouring countries. “I assume there are still a few hundred tourists waiting to be brought back home,” Lenz said. He added that he was optimistic that commercial flights will resume soon in some regions. Initially about 17,000 people registered with the Swiss foreign ministry. It believes that most of them have by now returned by their own means or have else decided to stay abroad. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-14;Ranking finds Swiss cities less expensive;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cost-of-living_ranking-swiss-cities-zurich-geneva-less-expensive/45680066;"Zurich and Geneva are still among the world’s ten most expensive cities, but both have slid down the rankings since last year. The full effect of the coronavirus crisis remains to be seen. In the Economist Intelligence Unit’sExternal link annual report comparing the cost of living in cities around the world, Zurich is tied for 5th place with Paris; in 2019 it ranked 4th. Geneva – in 5th last year – now ranks 10th. First place is a three-way tie between Singapore, Hong Kong and newcomer Osaka; New York has climbed three slots into 4th. The survey includes prices for items like consumer goods, rent and transport in 133 cities around the world. [See box below for more details.] The cost of living has fallen by around 4% on average, states the Worldwide Cost of Living 2020 report. While 31 of the 37 European cities have become cheaper since the 2019 report, 15 of the 16 US cities have become more expensive. “European cities are likely to fall even more in comparison to US cities,” said report author Nicholas Fitzroy, attributing this to the weak euro and a decrease in demand. Although Switzerland with its franc is not part of the eurozone, participating nations are important trading partners for the Swiss. Based on research done in September and March, some prices had already been influenced by the Covid-19 crisis. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) is keeping an eye on the effect of the various regional and national lockdown measures. “The longer they go on in any country, the heavier the economic burden will be. That being said, for a [European] country like Switzerland, restrictions in other European countries will have a big impact, given the interdependence of their economies,” Fitzroy, Risk Briefing Director and Middle East analyst at the EIU, told swissinfo.ch. “We are currently expecting the Swiss economy to contract by around 5% in 2020, owing to the hit to both domestic and global demand from local lockdowns and international travel restrictions,” Fitzroy said. He pointed out that Swiss unemployment was rising more slowly than in Western nations like the US and Britain, which implies that the downward pressure on prices, due to collapsing demand, might be less significant in Switzerland. “However, the importance of the Swiss tourism industry, which will be destroyed in the short term, will be an important factor in suppressing demand, in turn driving down prices,” he said. Switzerland could suffer its worst economic downturn on record, the government said on Wednesday, with the coronavirus epidemic shrinking the economy by as much as 10.4% this year.

2020-04-13;Swiss respect coronavirus measures over Easter weekend;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/good-citizens_swiss-adhered-well-to-corona-measures-over-easter-weekend/45686780;Most of the Swiss population respected measures introduced to counter the spread of the coronavirus over the long Easter weekend, according to authorities. Police still had to be called on to deal with offenders, typically teenagers and young adults. Families also violated the rules more often than average, according to the police in canton St Gallen in the northeast of the country. In many cases, several families went out together and violated the cap on gatherings larger than five people. But most citizens showed discipline despite the warm weather. The holiday weekend also witnessed lower-than-usual street traffic, Swiss public radio, SRF, reports. The transalpine Gotthard tunnel in central Switzerland is usually congested with holidaymakers headed south for the Easter break. Not so this Good Friday which witnessed about 1,800 southbound vehicles, less than 10% the peak traffic seen in other years, according to police in canton Uri. Since the start of Easter weekend, the daily number of new coronavirus cases dropped to around 400 between Saturday and Sunday. Numbers fluctuated between 700 and 800 last week. While too early to call, the drop raises hopes that Switzerland is moving away from the daily average of 1,000 cases witnessed at the end of March. Some of the emergency measures introduced in March will be gradually eased towards the end of April. A decision on the specific areas and measures to be relaxed will be presented on April 16.

2020-04-13;Switzerland urged to take in refugees stranded in Greece;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/vulnerable-population_switzerland-urged-to-take-in-refugees-stranded-in-greece/45686070;More than 100 humanitarian groups are calling on the Swiss government to take in refugees stranded in camps in Greece. The coronavirus pandemic, they argue, makes such acts of international solidarity all the more urgent. The number of asylum application in Switzerland is at an all-time low and the country has the funds, space and human resources needed to look after many refugees, noted the “Evacuate Now”External link campaigners in a statement published on Monday. “We urge the Federal Council [Switzerland's executive body] and parliament to bring as many refugees as possible from the Aegean to Switzerland,” they said. “As a Dublin country, Switzerland shares responsibility for the humanitarian catastrophe on the Greek islands.” The statement called for quick action considering the coronavirus pandemic. It pointed to the dire situations in camps such as Moria, which was built to house 3,000 people and now holds about 20,000, on the Greek island of Lesbos. An outbreak there would be catastrophic and cause many deaths. “In the past few days, Switzerland has shown with the largest repatriation campaign in its history that evacuations are possible,” continued the statement. “What applies to people with a Swiss passport must also be possible for the most vulnerable.” According to Swiss public radio, SRFExternal link, Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter is cited as suggesting that Switzerland could not unilaterally solve the situation. The report cited a State Secretariat for Migration official as saying that plans announced in January that would have allowed some underage refugees to travel to Switzerland have been suspended. The statement is co-signed by 107 organisations including Amnesty International Switzerland, FIZ Office for Women Trafficking and Migration, Society for Threatened Peoples and Public Eye. + A look at Switzerland’s new asylum system There are 70.8 million forcibly displaced individualsExternal link worldwide, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Some 14,269 asylum applications were made in Switzerland in 2019External link, a 6.5% decrease relative to the previous year, according to official figures.

2020-04-13;When there’s plenty of work in the fields, but few workers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/asparagus-harvest-_when-there-s-plenty-of-work-in-the-fields--but-few-workers/45679386;Swiss farmers are having to improvise to find enough labourers during the coronavirus pandemic to help with the harvest, and – as one example illustrates – are finding creative solutions to get their produce to market.  Asparagus shoots are still covered with earth on the Jucker farm in Rafz, a small town northwest of the city of Zurich. The vegetable shoots are waiting for migrant workers to harvest them, however this year many of the foreign labourers may not arrive.  “Many of them are still in their countries, waiting for the borders to re-open,” says Nadine Gloor, head of marketing for the farm, which employs 150 people, either for the asparagus and pumpkin planting and harvest, in the farm’s fresh produce shops, or in its two on-site restaurants.   Swiss agriculture depends on foreign labour, originating largely from eastern Europe and Portugal. According to statistics from the Federal Office for Migration, the agricultural and forestry sector employed just over 18,000 seasonal workers from abroad last year.  Usually, at this time of spring, there are 80 people from Poland and Romania already in the fields picking asparagus and strawberries on the Jucker farm.  However, the coronavirus crisis has seen borders close across Europe, including those between Switzerland and its neighbours, making it impossible to travel from eastern or southern Europe to the alpine country. Even if they could leave home, many foreigners like migrant workers from Portugal would be faced with having to self isolate upon their return. That rule has been in force in Portugal since March 20.  However, the Jucker operation has been fortunate since, Gloor says, some of the workers were already in Switzerland when the borders closed, and many Swiss residents have been responding to the job ads placed on the farm’s websiteExternal link, or a website especially created by Switzerland’s fruit and vegetable producers to recruit farmworkers, in cooperation with an online recruiting agency, CoopleExternal link. Normally active in matching job seekers looking for flexible hours or temporary work in gastronomy, aviation or event management, or other sectors of the economy which have largely shut down, Coople is now pointing people in search of jobs towards agriculture.    According to official data, the health crisis lockdown has caused a spike in unemployment and so-called short-time work. A quarter of the entire Swiss workforce has been affected.  However, farm work is not appealing because it is manual labour and requires long hours (55 per week) for low pay (CHF14.50 per hour). “It needs to be done in the sun and rain, in all weather,” says Gloor. “The fieldworker must also have the skills to know how to plant the asparagus without spoiling it, so we can’t take everyone who applies.”   The agricultural sector hopes the federal government will help to make the work more attractive. “We expect the federal government to take the necessary measures to subsidise agricultural wages in line with market conditions in this exceptional situation. This would enable the 315,000 people currently affected by short-time work to benefit,” said Viktor Calabrò, president of Coople, in a trade magazine on March 25.  Special health measures, including social distancing and regular handwashing, are also being enforced on Swiss farms as in other industries where employees must still work on site.  “If the lockdown continues much longer, farmers will have to find a different approach to manage the harvest,” said Loïc Bardet, head of Agora, a farmers’ association in French-speaking Switzerland. Bardet made the comment ahead of the Swiss government’s decision on April 8 to extend the lockdown at least until April 26.   But the federal authorities don’t see any risk to the country's food supply. “I don't believe there will be a shortage of seasonal farmworkers. It is too early to say how the situation will evolve,” countered Florie Marion, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Agriculture, pointing out that the government has launched several measures to help the economy, including the agriculture sector. Among them, temporary work visas can now be granted for six months, up from the previous three.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-13;Surviving Covid-19: the Swiss economy’s strengths and weaknesses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/global-recession_surviving-covid-19--the-swiss-economy-s-strengths-and-weaknesses/45677494;The current pandemic will plunge the world economy into recession, at least in the first part of the year. What tools does Switzerland have to minimise the economic and social damage of this crisis? And what factors could jeopardise the prospects for an economic recovery?  The CHF10 billion ($10.3 billion) in emergency aid announced by the Swiss government on March 13 was increased to CHF40 billion on March 20 and then to CHF60 billion on April 3. With this money, which is far from final, the government intends to implement measures to stem the economic and social consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. In particular, they will serve to provide liquidity for companies, prevent redundancies as far as possible and cover the loss of earnings of employees.  This is the largest aid package ever agreed by the Swiss government. The CHF60 billion planned so far corresponds almost to what the government spends in one year (CHF71 billion in 2019) and is 8.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). But it will probably not be enough to cope with the economic repercussions of the pandemic. According to various estimates, the Swiss economy is losing CHF4-5 billion a week, which is likely to increase considerably if the current situation continues and many companies close down.  Switzerland overcame the 2008 crisis better than many other European countries, although the crisis had directly hit one of the pillars of its economy, the banking sector. It has at least three strengths to deal with this historic challenge, but just as many weaknesses.  + Moderate public debt The G20 countriesExternal link, which provide 85% of global economic output, have said they will earmark $5 trillion to minimise the economic and social damage of the pandemic, boost growth and maintain market stability. Several other governments intend to inject huge amounts of money into their economies. These contributions are essential to deal with the current emergency, but they will further burden an increasingly unsustainable public debt for many countries.  According to OECD data, in 2018 the debt burden was already overwhelming for Japan (240% of GDP), Italy (147%), the United States (136%), France (122%), (Britain 117%) and Spain (115%), to name but a few countries. In Switzerland, public debt (government, cantons and municipalities) amounts to just 27% of GDP.  This low share is linked in particular to the debt brakeExternal link, a mechanism introduced by the government since 2003 to prevent structural financial imbalances and to put an end to the persistent deficits accumulated since the 1990s. Since 2006, government accounts have almost systematically recorded surpluses, which are used to relieve debt. The debt brake, which has also been adopted by the cantons, now gives Switzerland good financial leeway to alleviate the repercussions of the inevitable economic recession.   + Compensation for short-time work Another important tool to ease the economic and social consequences of the pandemic is compensation for short-time work, set up to cope with temporary declines in business activities and to safeguard jobs. In times of crisis, instead of making people redundant, companies can reduce working hours for a certain period of time and use this compensation to cover part of the wages.  Thanks to this, employers hold on to already trained employees who can quickly resume activities. For their part, employees don’t end up unemployed and keep their social protection intact. In the United States in comparison some ten million workers have found themselves unemployed in the past three weeks.  Short-time work compensation has already been paid to thousands of companies in recent crises, but never at levels comparable to the current one. Since mid-March, benefits have been claimed for around 1.3 million employees – a quarter of the active workforce in Switzerland.   + Own central bank Under Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank played a key role in stabilising the economic situation in the eurozone after the international crisis of 2008. But the current disputes over whether to issue eurobonds demonstrate once again the conflicting expectations of European states. The Swiss National BankExternal link (SNB), however, can implement a monetary policy tailored to the specific needs of an individual economy.  Should the coronavirus crisis drain the government’s resources, the SNB could intervene with large injections of money. The idea of such interventions by the SNB has always horrified more liberal parties and economists. But it was primarily the SNB that saved the largest Swiss bank (UBS) in 2008. The pressure on the central bank, which posted a profit of CHF50 billion last year, would become quite strong in the event of major social imbalances.  - Dependence on exports Switzerland does not have a large domestic market like Germany or Japan and earns around one franc in two abroad. More than two-thirds of its exports are absorbed by the EU and the US. If these countries were to slide into a long and deep recession, Switzerland could not come out of it lightly either, as was the case after the collapse of the world economy in 2008.  - Franc too strong The strength of the Swiss franc has symbolised the stability of the Swiss economy for decades and helped attract investment in companies and capital into banks. However, since the introduction of the euro at the latest, the strong franc has also become one of Switzerland’s weak points: any strengthening of the franc against the European currency weakens the competitiveness of the export industry and the tourism sector. Over the past fortnight the SNB has once again had to intervene on several occasions to prevent another surge in the franc, which is regarded as a safe haven in times of crisis. But even these interventions may not be enough in the event of new turbulence in the eurozone.  - Hazardous isolation In the wake of the 2008 crisis, the United States and the main European countries were forced to finance enormous bank rescue and economic recovery measures which left behind a mountain of debt. In order to get money back into the state coffers, the governments of these countries decided to adopt a common strategy to eliminate loopholes used by companies and individuals to escape the tax authorities.  Under the aegis of the G20, the OECD and the EU, major international tax reforms have been introduced, leading to the automatic exchange of information on bank accounts and new rules on the taxation of transnational corporations. Switzerland, completely isolated, is among the countries that have been most affected by the new international standards.  A scenario that risks being repeated with this new crisis. The Swiss government, for example, will have little say in defending its interests in the ongoing negotiations at the G20 and the OECD on a new international corporate tax system. It should enable countries with a large market to get a much more substantial share of the taxes paid by web giants and other transnational corporations. According to initial estimates, the government risks losing CHF5 billion in tax revenue a year.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-12;Coronavirus: Swiss president says end of lockdown requires protective measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus--swiss-president-says-end-of-lockdown-requires-protective-measures/45684750;Switzerland’s president says the easing of isolation measures implemented to limit the spread of coronavirus must be accompanied by an elaborate protection plan. As a prerequisite, there must be no further increase in cases, Simonetta Sommaruga told the German-language weekly SonntagsBlick in an interview published on Sunday. She cautioned it is too early to know whether the peak of coronavirus infections has been reached. Protective measures could include the use of masks and testing, although at what scale is in question. Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency 2020, categorically rejects the notion of completely isolating at risks groups, an idea floated by some experts for economic reasons. At higher risk of contracting COVID-19, are those over the age of 65 and individuals with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, diabetes or high blood pressure. We are talking about a very large number of people here, Sommaruga said. “It is not possible to completely cut these groups off from the outside world.” She maintains the government response to the global health crisis was neither too rushed nor unduly cautious. On the economic front, the government has guaranteed historically high sums to ensure that wages can continue to be paid and that liquidity is available. Over the past few days, Switzerland has recorded between 500 and 700 news cases daily, adding up to more than 25,000 cases across the country. The coronavirus death toll has topped 1,000, making the Alpine nation one of the countries most affected by the pandemic to date. The government is expected to announce next Thursday how it plans to ease restrictions introduced to counter the spread of the virus that originated in China and spread across the globe. Some European nations have already begun easing restrictions introduced to curb the pandemic. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-12;Coronavirus: good French-Swiss relations mobilise to save lives;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-patients-treated-in-switzerland_coronavirus--good-french-swiss-relations-mobilise-to-save-lives/45674338;Faced with huge numbers of people suffering from Covid-19 arriving at hospitals in northeastern France, a local official turned to neighbouring Switzerland for help. The request met receptive ears and it has yielded results: about 50 French patients are now being treated in Switzerland. Cross-border solidarity is proving particularly valuable in the era of the pandemic. Several Swiss cantons have agreed to accept French patients struck by Covid-19 in order to help overcrowded hospitals in the Grand Est and Franche-Comté regions which border Switzerland. Fifty sick people from France have so far been transferred to Switzerland. Germany and Luxembourg have also taken in French patients. This all stems from the initiative of a local official: Brigitte Klinkert, the president of the Upper Rhine departmental council, decided to mobilise good connections established with regional neighbours in Switzerland and Germany. On March 21, she wrote a message to the governments of the cantons of Basel City, Basel Country and Jura, as well as to the French prime minister, appealing for solidarity beyond national borders. Everyone thought it was an excellent idea, and the Swiss cantons agreed the same day to make beds available. On Sunday morning, the Swiss government endorsed the agreements and the hospitals responsible began making arrangements for the transfers. “This cooperation was launched very spontaneously,” says Brigitte Klinkert. “Our friendly relations and cross-border solidarity came into play.” This first initiative took hold and spread: the Grand Est regional health agency seized the baton and contacted other Swiss cantons with the help of French consulates in Geneva and Zurich. More beds were made available, including in regions such as St. Gallen and Thurgau that are not necessarily in the habit of cooperating with Alsace. From now on, requests for patient transfers from abroad are centralised at the Swiss Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link. No specific agreement has been reached between the Swiss and French governments and no compensation has been negotiated, according to the French Embassy in SwitzerlandExternal link and the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.External link “Switzerland is in permanent contact with neighbouring countries to coordinate measures in the struggle against the coronavirus and to find swift solutions to specific problems,” the FDFA says. “Thanks to a concerted approach, Switzerland has been able to guarantee, among other things, that its borders remain open for cross-border workers, which is particularly important for hospitals in some regions of our country.” The Neuchâtel Hospital Network has said 60% of its nurses working in intensive care are cross-border workers. At the Jura Hospital, 30% of the medical and nursing staff live in neighbouring France. In total, there are more than 30,000 French cross-border workers employed in the health sector in Switzerland. “A solution for cross-border workers has been in place since March 19,” says Frédéric Journès, the French ambassador in Switzerland. “Just seven days later, the plan to accept patients from Alsace in response to the health emergency there was activated.” Two-way solidarity Good collaboration is beneficial to both sides: Switzerland profits from qualified labour and France from infrastructure in an emergency. A framework agreement on trans-border health cooperationExternal link between the two countries has already been agreed. It entered into force on October 1 last year. This document underlines that the cost of treatment should be covered by the patient’s country of origin. And what if the supply of hospital beds runs short in Switzerland too? During the pandemic, the cantons are obliged to inform the federal government regularly about hospital occupancy rates. The Federal Office of Public Health says it is using these figures to evaluate capacity to take in patients from abroad. It then confers with cantonal authorities to determine whether a transfer is possible. This global vision on a Swiss scale still isn’t perfect, however, the Jura Hospital says: “At the moment, we are lacking a national platform to assess capacity in intensive care units and everything is reliant on contact between hospitals.” If the pandemic continues to intensify in Switzerland and the health infrastructure can’t keep up with demand, the country could, in turn, request help from neighbours. “We are convinced that faced with this pandemic, European solidarity is essential to fight off Covid-19,” says Journès.

2020-04-12;What Easter is normally like in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/traditions_what-easter-is-normally-like-in-switzerland/45676262;For many people living in Switzerland, the long Easter weekend is usually a time for festive gatherings and maybe a trip to another part of the country. Because of the coronavirus lockdown, this year is quite different. One classic “event” each Easter is the pilgrimage of sun-hungry northerners over and through the Alps to canton Ticino – popular for its mild climate, lakeside promenades and palm trees. This year the Swiss authorities have urged people to stay put – even if they have second homes waiting for them in mountain villages or other recreational areas. The cities will also be quieter than usual. For example, social distancing makes it impossible for egg lovers to gather for traditional public egg-cracking parties. However, families at home can still play this game. Despite restrictions on selling many non-essential items, retailers are still allowed to sell edible Easter-themed merchandise such as chocolate rabbits. Swiss supermarkets in general are well-stocked, though the recent surge in home cooking and baking means last-minute shoppers might have to be flexible about ingredients. Actually, that’s often the case around a holiday in Switzerland, when shopping hours are restricted anyway.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-11;Government warns not to underestimate coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/appeal_government-warns-not-to-underestimate-coronavirus/45683908;President Simonetta Sommaruga has appealed to the population to keep respecting social distancing and hygiene rules as increase in infection cases stagnates. She thanked notably farmers providing fresh vegetable to customers via house deliveries four weeks into a ban on public markets as part of government measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. For his part, Interior Minister Alain Berset has called on citizens to follow the government regulations strictly to avoid a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. “There’s a risk that infections will spread again,” he told several newspapers of the CH-Media publishing group on Saturday. “There are no shortcuts. We have to go the whole way,” he is quoted as saying. Daniel Koch, the government’s delegate on the Covid-19 pandemic, added that a first peak had been reached. “The trend is going in the right direction for the moment. But a resurgence of cases can never be excluded,” he told a news conference on Saturday. Over the past few days, Switzerland has recorded between 500 and 700 new cases daily. Koch said it was impossible to predict in detail how much the current restrictions can be relaxed without triggering a second wave of infections. He said it was important to remain flexible to react promptly. The government is due to announce its exit scenario from the anti-Covid-19 measures next Thursday. As part of the staggered lifting of the curbs, the government is also considering targeted measures including large-scale testing and voluntary contact tracing programmes. Berset reiterated that there is not enough scientific evidence that the wearing of face masks in public would help reduce the number of infections decisively. “Of course, everybody is free to wear a mask if he or she wants to do so,” he said.

2020-04-11;How coronavirus has changed life at Swiss embassies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-diplomacy_how-coronavirus-has-changed-life-at-swiss-embassies/45677566;"As many activities around the world have shut down because of coronavirus, diplomats have been working overtime to get their nationals home, often in difficult circumstances. We asked Swiss ambassadors around the world how the coronavirus has affected their work, and what their lives have been like in the past few weeks.  Despite the pressure they are under, many gave us lengthy, detailed replies. They stressed the unprecedented nature of this crisis and the need for solidarity. The embassies that responded to our inquiries were curated by the Swiss foreign ministry.   This global crisis is unprecedented and is therefore uncharted territory for everyone, writes Swiss Ambassador to France Livia Leu Agosti. In the past weeks, she has been dealing almost exclusively with the coronavirus crisis, “on the one hand with its effects on our fellow citizens abroad, and on the other hand with the changes in bilateral cooperation across the border”. At the same time, the embassy's internal procedures have had to be continually adapted, she says. Almost all embassy staff now work from home, except for her and a few other employees.  Switzerland’s western neighbour is home to the largest community of Swiss abroad. In addition, thousands of tourists from Switzerland travel through France and its overseas territories every day. “To reach all these people and provide them with the necessary information, an intensive communication campaign was necessary via social media, the Internet and the Embassy's newsletter,” writes Leu. She says Swiss consuls in Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg as well as Paris have “worked with their teams seven days a week to answer the hundreds of inquiries and to facilitate the return journey of Swiss citizens”.  Together with the French authorities, Ambassador Leu also had to clarify the situation of some 175,000 French cross-border workers who commute to Switzerland every day for their work. “Their continued employment in Switzerland despite closed borders is very important because many of them work in Swiss hospitals in the border regions,” she told swissinfo.ch. Leu also had to intervene on various occasions to unblock the delivery of confiscated protective masks .  Asked about the importance of solidarity at this exceptional time, she says it is more important than ever. “I am convinced that France will not forget Swiss solidarity, just as patients in Swiss hospitals will remain grateful to French healthcare staff.”  “The pandemic is having a major impact on my daily life as an ambassador, but also on the lives of all embassy staff,” writes Ambassador Guillaume Scheurer in Morocco. “It is almost like a revolution, in the sense that we have had to completely rethink our way of working and our way of communicating both internally and externally.”  In dealing with the crisis and getting Swiss nationals home, diplomacy is more important than ever, he writes.  Contacts with the Moroccan government are more intense than ever “since we are in almost permanent contact, day and night” and “we are managing this crisis together with other local, Swiss and international actors”.  There has been plenty of solidarity, he says. “The foreign representations in Morocco are working together and trying to make it easier for all tourists to return home. On several occasions, the Moroccan authorities have also shown a great deal of support, for example in authorising numerous repatriation flights or finding solutions for caravanners stuck in often deplorable circumstances.”  Swiss nationals living in Morocco have also offered accommodation for stranded compatriots, since many hotels have closed their doors. “It is heart-warming to see these beautiful expressions of solidarity,” Scheurer writes. “Each successful flight, each problem solved, each passage on a ferry to France or Spain is felt as a real happiness, a personal and collective success.” “I have already experienced several crisis situations, but never a crisis of this magnitude, of global dimension, with a completely open time horizon,” says Swiss Ambassador to India Andreas Baum.  The crisis has changed the life of the embassy overnight, with the focus now is on finding stranded Swiss nationals “in a country that is not only huge but is in a total lockdown” and somehow getting them home. Except for the dedicated special flights team, embassy staff are now working from home, and all meetings take place by phone or online. Baum says this is a completely new experience for him because he usually prefers to “meet face to face to discuss things or exchange written information”.  The Ambassador, a former doctor, likes to read at night to help him sleep, but sometimes that is also when the doubts come: “Can we all stay healthy? Have we taken all measures to protect ourselves as a team?”  Teamwork and solidarity are key, he says. “This illness, the fear of infection, will distance us from each other and whoever gets sick is suddenly to be excluded. Team spirit, humanity and solidarity are all the more important.”  And for inner balance, he says he can sometimes enjoy a privilege that not many people in lockdown have, “jogging in the embassy garden, dahlias as big as plates, colourful as they can only be in India, green parrots, and the thought: what an absurdly beautiful and wonderful spring”. Answers came from two ambassadors who job share:  Pedro Zwahlen, who is responsible for Australia; and Yasmine Chatila Zwahlen, who is responsible for Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu and Kiribati. Swiss travellers in these areas are often particularly adventurous, they write. If travellers remain blocked in the most remote areas of the world , things can quickly become somewhat complicated .  “In mid-March we divided the Canberra team into two shifts, working alternately in the embassy offices,” they write. “This increases the chance that not everyone will fall ill at the same time, should a colleague become infected. Those who do not work in the office work online. Apart from some chronic Internet problems, this works quite well, even if we miss the daily exchange during the coffee break.”  They say the most complex task in recent weeks has been “to help Swiss people travel home because international air traffic has collapsed. Countless fellow citizens have been seeking the advice of the embassy and consulate. Together with other European diplomats, we try to assess the travel possibilities and coordinate special flights with the head office”. Asked if they are sleeping, they reply only that “when night comes here, day begins in Bern”.  But the crisis, they point out, has led not only to immediate operational challenges such as repatriating Swiss nationals and reorganizing embassy work; it has changed many things in the world. “We must also keep these in mind,” write the job share pair. “What are the consequences of the rapid and fundamental shocks on geopolitics in our region? What impact does the crisis have on power relations and political and social stability? The wheel of history is turning faster.” “I have experienced similar situations, for example during the war in Yugoslavia, but without Swiss tourists,” writes Ambassador Markus-Alexander Antonietti from Peru. He says he sleeps “briefly, but with intense dreams”.  Peru is also in strict lockdown. A core team is working at the embassy and the rest from home, he says.  The size of the country and the severely reduced travel possibilities within Peru have led to “big practical problems in the repatriation of tourists, who are spread all over the country (3.5 times the size of Germany, but without the infrastructure of Germany)”. The embassy has had to organise bus convoys to bring Swiss nationals and travellers from other European countries to the capital Lima.  In this situation, solidarity is extremely important, he writes. “In Peru, it exists between the countries of the EU and us. I have been on EU chat and in EU Skype meetings. We have already helped dozens of EU citizens with domestic transport and repatriation, and the EU has helped us.” In times like these, all the contacts and network established in the past become particularly important, writes Ambassador Yves Rossier from Moscow. Official meetings have become very rare, and conversations with the Russian authorities usually take place by telephone. No online events are planned, because a large part of non-verbal communication would be lost .  He also stresses the importance of solidarity. “We communicate daily with other embassies, coordinating and comparing approaches. Return flight options for Swiss citizens are also discussed with other diplomatic missions. Swiss nationals in Russia are kept regularly informed of the situation, and we are in close contact with the Swiss Club of Moscow, which supports and informs Swiss people in Russia through a WhatsApp group.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-10;South-bound traffic down by 90% for holiday weekend;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/staying-at-home_south-bound-traffic-down-by-90--for-holiday-weekend/45682800;"The first of the four days of Easter has seen people in Switzerland largely complying with calls not to travel, particularly to the southern canton of Ticino. As the government wished, there has – so far – been no traffic jams recorded at the entrance to the Gotthard, the road tunnel linking the north of the country with canton Ticino in the south. “People are clearly respecting the calls of authorities not to drive to Ticino, which is particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic”, a spokeswoman from the Viasuisse traffic monitoring body told the Keystone-SDA news agency. Ticino police authorities said that the volume of traffic on the A2 motorway was down by 90% compared with normal; police from the canton Uri (at the north side of the Gotthard) reported similar numbers, saying that they counted some 1,800 cars per day heading south this week, compared with the normal of 17,000 for this period. Uri police have also been stopping an average of 300 cars per day, to remind drivers of the government recommendations and to try to convince them to turn back, if possible. In Switzerland, Good Friday and Easter Monday being bank holidays, the weekend is a four-day affair, and many head south, often to holiday homes. This year, however, canton Ticino, which shares around half its border with Italy, is one of the Swiss regions hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic: after Geneva, it has the highest number of cases per capita, while it has also recorded the highest overall number of fatalities to date. In other regions of the country, including Bern, Zurich, and Neuchâtel, police reported that while many people were out and about, the majority were adhering to social distancing and maximum group-size rules. Earlier this week, the government extended restrictive measures to contain Covid-19 by a week, to at least April 26. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-10;Swiss development aid re-allocated to combat virus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-development-aid-re-allocated-to-combat-virus/45682116;Aid, in the form of 10,000 protective suits, was delivered to Italy on Thursday, while funding has been allocated for multilateral efforts to combat Covid-19 worldwide. Citing the importance of international solidarity, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) announced on ThursdayExternal link that it had already sent a shipment of protective suits, worth CHF100,000 ($103,625), to Italy, with another delivery planned. Similar donations had previously been made to China, Nepal, and Serbia, the SDC wrote. It also specified that such actions are first discussed with relevant government ministries – notably health, economics, and economic supply – to ensure that they are in line with national measures to combat Covid-19, and that much-needed Swiss supplies aren’t depleted. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a situation of national caution around the import and export of vital medical equipment. Earlier this week, a truck was stopped on its way from Italy into Switzerland, and a cargo of disinfectant confiscated by border guards. Switzerland, meanwhile, received large quantities of protective material, including gowns, from China this week. As well as the deliveries, the SDC also wrote that CHF18 million has been allocated to multilateral groups working to combat the virus internationally: the World Health Organisation, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the World Bank, and the Global Fund. The SDC’s general aid priorities and programs have also been slightly adjusted due to the crisis. In various nations – Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Bolivia, Honduras, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Moldova, Kosovo – budgets will be redistributed over the coming months towards projects aiming to boost income and basic living conditions, to develop emergency health facilities, secure food supplies, and help refugees or displaced people. While Switzerland, along with much of the developed world, struggles with the fallout from the pandemic, the SDC warns that less wealthy nations, especially in Africa, risk an even greater crisis should the virus break out there to the same extent as it has in Europe.

2020-04-10;Cross-border love;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/kreuzlingen-constance_cross-border-love/45673240;The Swiss city of Kreuzlingen and neighbouring Constance in Germany have been divided by the coronavirus pandemic. Two fences separate them after borders between the two nations were closed to slow the spread of the virus. The residents of both cities normally move freely across an invisible line marking where one nation ends and the other begins. But in the time of Covid-19 everything has changed. The German authorities erected a first fence in mid-March when the border was closed. The Swiss put up a second fence a couple weeks later because too many people were passing beers, playing cards and kissing through the wire in defiance of the rules. The barriers have become a meeting point for people divided by the epidemic – and a reminder of its disruption for Europeans accustomed to traveling where they please. Basel-based freelance photographer Roland Schmid travelled to the area and brought back images of families, lovers and friends torn apart by the new physical border. They appear pressed against the chain links in the warm spring sunshine, taking care of each other and trying to keep their relationships going in these trying times. Close enough to say I love you but too far apart to touch. This is a coronavirus no-man's land. It traces the route of a barbed wire-topped barrier that split Switzerland and Germany during World War Two and that was removed long ago.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-10;Solving the ventilator shortage;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_solving-the-ventilator-shortage/45680386;ETH Zurich researcher Torbjørn Netland advocates a global approach to the production of ventilators and defines six areas of activity. An epidemic is an emotional issue. With the lives of our friends and loved ones on the line, our reaction tends to be: Close the borders! Ground the planes! Such responses are natural and perfectly understandable.  Although isolation has become a necessity on a personal level, using the same strategy in other contexts can quickly become counterproductive - for example, when it comes to ventilators. Health ministries all over the world face the same dreadful dilemma. Last year, 77,000 new ventilators were enough to meet the market demand of the entire planet. In April, New York City alone forecasts a need for 30,000 additional machines – and no one has a real idea of what the total demand in the corona crisis will be. Short-sighted politicians everywhere see increased domestic production as the solution to the ventilator shortage, and for some products and some countries that may well be part of the solution.  But when you look at where the ventilator companies are located and where they source the 700+ parts that go into them, it’s easy to see that a better solution is not hoarding machines, 3D printing, or cobbling together makeshift contraptions. In the short run, the only way to succeed is by getting the world’s most established ventilator manufacturers to mass-produce many more units. Fast. Unfortunately, the global supply chains - which we could use most now - are being dismantled. Such systems are now even discredited as one of the factors triggering the pandemic. Do we want to save the lives of as many coronavirus victims as possible? Then we should increase the worldwide production capacity of ventilator manufacturers, not hinder it.  The leading manufacturers of ventilators have the advantage of not having to convert their entire production lines. They can also produce more cost-efficiently.  But there is a catch: although some of these manufacturers have already increased their production by 30-50%, they cannot achieve a growth rate of 500 or 1,000% alone, which may be the level required.  They need support with their supply chains. I am not suggesting that the WHO should coordinate the entire production capacity and transport of ventilators.  But the producers and the supply chains of ventilators, large logistics companies, the national postal services and even the national military procurement agencies should work together. First, let’s map the supply chain for ventilators. In normal times it is enough to partner with reliable subcontractors, but in a crisis, manufacturers need to know what parts are needed and where they can be procured. Which components are the most scarce? Is the component necessary, or can a more readily available alternative be used instead?  Second, let’s streamline the pathways. Consider the best ways to get those parts to the manufacturer, and what it would take to expand capacity. Is there any overlap in supply chains between industries, for example, that could facilitate easier shipments? Could we establish global, rapid-response logistic networks through air traffic hubs? Third, let’s forecast demand. Plot where demand is growing, and where the next coronavirus epicentres are likely to be. Leading research centres such as Imperial College London are already contributing daily updates, and their analytics could be used to manage orders fairly and efficiently. Fourth, let’s recruit more help. Next, think about which companies, at each level of this supply chain, are best positioned to step up their capacity. In the United Kingdom a vacuum cleaner producer is ramping up production of a new device designed in house. Who else might have useful expertise? Fifth, let’s train the operators. One manufacturer said recently in Der Spiegel that the biggest challenge is to find enough trained people to operate the ventilators. Can the machine be simplified and made more user-friendly?  Does the documentation need to be improved or training simplified or digitalized? Could we start training health care workers now to run the ventilators that will arrive in the next few months? Sixth, let’s look for alternatives. The above tasks should take priority, but during this global crisis, we must also look for substitute products. Many ambulances have respirators as part of their standard equipment. For the duration of the emergency, reserve mobile respirators could be re-purposed.  Could lower-tech solutions, such as hand pumps, which saved lives in Copenhagen during a 1952 polio epidemic, play a role in some countries?   Finally, we must not lose sight of this global, strategic view throughout the entire duration of the emergency. If we want to solve the health problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic effectively and efficiently, we must adopt a broad, systemic perspective. The virus doesn’t worry about boundaries – and nor should we.

2020-04-09;Sixteen Swiss hospitals take part in coronavirus global Solidarity trial;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/search-for-a-cure_sixteen-swiss-hospitals-take-part-in-coronavirus-global-solidarity-trial/45681134;Some 1,000 patients in Switzerland are expected to participate in trials of experimental treatments for Covid-19 as part of the WHO global Solidarity trial. Launched in March under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, the Solidarity trialExternal link aims to generate reliable data on the effectiveness and side effects of potential treatments. While randomized clinical trials normally take years to design and conduct, the Solidarity trial is expected to reduce the time by 80% by enrolling patients in one single randomized trial. This will overcome the risk of multiple small trials not generating strong enough evidence. The WHO has selected four therapies for testing based on laboratory, animal and clinical studies evidence of their potential to treat Covid-19. This includes remdesivir, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir, and interferon-beta. Novartis recently announced it was donating up to 130 million doses of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine in part to advance clinical trials. Switzerland is one of some 70 countries participating in the effort along with France, Spain, South Africa and Canada. The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) has provided CHF1.6 million to the global trial and is working closely with the Federal Office of Public Health. Lausanne University Hospital CHUV is coordinating Switzerland’s participation in the tiral. The sixteen hospital centres are the university hospitals of Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Basel, the hospital networks of Valais and Neuchâtel, along with several cantonal hospitals. The hospitals are expected to recruit up to 1,000 patients to take part in the study according to a statementExternal link from CHUV. The trial in Switzerland is expected to last from three months to one year but will depend in part on the evolution of the epidemic. The study may include up to 1,000 adult hospitalized patients who have not yet received treatment with Covid-19. According to the WHOExternal link, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and who have consented to be part of the study will be randomly selected to receive either local standard care alone or local standard care and one of a list of study drugs. SNSF also announced that it has received 284 grant applicationsExternal link for its special call for coronavirus research issued in March.

2020-04-09;How far will companies go to save themselves in the coronavirus crisis?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eye-on-the-multinationals_how-far-will-companies-go-to-save-themselves-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-/45680936;Companies are reaching deep into their own and government pockets to save themselves in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. But, how far are they willing to go and when is it too far? The health and safety of employees is our top priority, espouse companies. The phrase has taken on new meaning in a scenario that few companies expected nor prepared for – one in which, heart-wrenching decisions are being made about who receives a test, ventilator or mask. Sure, there are many firms that will come out of this stronger and others that will at least, emerge unscathed. Drugmakers like Novartis and ventilator manufacturers like Hamilton Medical are ramping up production. Swiss fragrance company GivaudanExternal link and chemical company Clariant are dedicating production lines to making much-needed disinfectants. And commodity traders are hoping this proves their worth (and deflects some of the criticism) as the logistics arm for the world, bringing everything from pineapples to face masks from one continent to another. But many more are scraping the barrel for ideas to mitigate the damage. Global manufacturing company Georg Fischer had to partially or completely shut down various plantsExternal link in Europe. In Switzerland, it introduced short-time work at most of its locations including its headquarters in Schaffhausen. Roughly 20% of the Swiss workforce is in a similar bout. Nestlé has committed to pay hourly and salaried staff affected by temporary stoppages in full for a minimum of twelve weeks. Top executives at Swiss industrial giant ABB are taking a 10%External link pay cut as part of cost reduction and solidarity measures during the crisis. UBS executivesExternal link announced a similar move today. Not all moves have been as well-received though. As TagesAnzeiger reported, ABB also offered coronavirus testing to hundreds of employeesExternal link, even those without symptoms, at a time when testing materials have been in short supply in Switzerland. While this may have helped protect employees, the move didn’t sit well with everyone. The backlash against Adidas for skipping rental paymentsExternal link on some stores is also a cautionary tale for companies: even if something is legal it isn’t necessarily right in the eyes of the public. This is of course only the part of the story we see here. Some of the hardest hit hardly touched six figure salaries. More are concerned that companies are cancelling orders or refusing to pay for goods already produced, in effect passing the costsExternal link of this crisis on to vulnerable workers in their supply chains. If the brand goes belly up, there may be no orders at all. What are your views? Send me a message: jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch Some good news on the testing front as Swiss biotech firm Quotient says it will have an antibody screening test available by next week. The Financial Times reports that the MosaiQ machine has been adapted to test for coronavirus antibodies and can conduct about 3,000 tests per day at around $15-25 a pop. Experts say antibody screening that detects a person’s immunity to the virus will be critical to easing lockdowns and restarting economies. Other Swiss firmsExternal link have also been making advances on serological tests. Pharma companies are treading a fine line between hope, science and profits in the search for a coronavirus cure. Novartis is at the centre of the controversial debate over hydroxychloroquine because it is one of the biggest makers of the antimalarial drug. The Novartis CEO stuck his neck out by commenting on the drug’s potential against Covid-19, which led to many hopeful, but in some cases misleading, headlines. Hard to believe that a few months ago the company was about to sell its U.S. generics division that manufacturers the dr.ug. In the U.S., some media reportsExternal link raise questions about whether there are any ulterior motives or behind the scenes deals between pharma companies and governments propping up some drugs. But back here at the Geneva-based WHO, the discussion is focused on eliminating patent rightsExternal link for treatments and vaccines to Covid-19 to prevent a “free for all” that puts poor countries last in line for life-saving drugs, says public health expert Suerie Moon in an interview. It wouldn’t be Easter time in Switzerland without chocolate and a reminder of how far the cocoa industry still has to go to put the Easter Bunny at ease. Nestlé announced a couple weeks ago that it was excluding some 4,000 producers in West Africa from its supply chain because they were farming on protected land. As NGO Public Eye writes, child labour remains rampantExternal link nearly twenty years after a major international agreement to eliminate it. It’s hard to fathom the impact the coronavirus crisis and its consequences will have on thousands of cocoa farmers already living on the brink. For now, Swiss chocolatiers are trying to bring some holiday cheer to their Easter displays by slapping facemasks on their chocolate bunniesExternal link and chickens.

2020-04-09;Solution found for apprentice exams amid coronavirus interruptions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education_solution-found-for-apprentice-exams-amid-coronavirus-interruptions/45680444;Thousands of young apprentices will receive their final certificate and be able to enter the job market this summer despite the interruption to their training caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the government announced that a plan has been developed with the cantons to assess the practical and theoretical knowledge of apprentices in their final year of training. Those that receive enough marks to pass will obtain their federal certificate or diplomaExternal link and be able to apply for jobs this summer. Some 75,000 young people in Switzerland are expected to complete their initial vocational training by then. Some Swiss industry and employee organisations welcomed the agreement. It will prevent young people with an apprenticeship certificate from having to start their working life with a negative 'crisis stamp', writes the Swiss Trade Association in a press releaseExternal link. Around two thirds of Swiss school leavers opt for an apprenticeship, under the country’s dual system of vocational training. This combines learning on the job in a company – and being paid a learning wage – with one to two days of theory at school. + Swiss vocational training serves as a model for others Under the new arrangement, students will not sit for final exams. Instead, marks from course work and practical experience will be used to assess professional and general knowledge. The practical assessment, usually an exam or evaluation in the training company, will be maintained but various procedures are being developed to ensure compliance with current coronavirus health and safety standards put in place by the government. In addition, a steering body, which includes professional training partners has been set up to develop solutions for job recruitment and placement.In a statementExternal link, the government stressed that the coronavirus crisis should not weaken vocational training and appealed to training companies to continue to recruit apprentices. Schools in Switzerland are currently closed to April 26 and even longer in some cantons. On April 2, the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Education Ministers announced that the schoolyear will not be extended, and secondary students will receive their diplomas despite the school closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. As part of this, Students in their final year of general or vocational schooling will also receive their diploma provided they pass their courses.

2020-04-09;Federal court blocks Lauber’s attempt to rejoin FIFA case;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/corruption-in-football_federal-court-blocks-lauber-s-attempt-to-rejoin-fifa-case/45680212;Switzerland’s top court has rejected Attorney General Michael Lauber’s bid to rejoin investigations of corruption in football. The court upheld a previous ruling that Lauber’s closed-door meetings with FIFA’s head had raised the appearance of bias. In a verdict released on Thursday, the Federal Court upheld the Federal Criminal Court’s order last June that Lauber recuse himself from the federal prosecutors’ probe. Lauber has denied wrongdoing and said “conspiracy theories” over his meetings with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and presumptions of dishonesty were harming prosecutorial integrity. Lauber had been investigating several cases of suspected corruption involving FIFA, based in Zurich, dating back to 2014 and the presidency of Sepp Blatter. He had acknowledged two meetings with Infantino in 2016, saying they were intended to help coordinate the investigation. He later acknowledged a third meeting in 2017 after media reports of the encounter emerged. Lauber had his pay cut for a year after a watchdog found last month he repeatedly told falsehoods and broke a prosecutors’ code of conduct in handling the probe. A fraud trial of three former senior German football officials and one Swiss over a suspect payment linked to the 2006 World Cup hosted by Germany has already started, but looks on the verge of collapse amid a coronavirus-mandated trial halt as a statute of limitation looms. Separately, the organisers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have strongly denied allegations from the U.S. Department of Justice that bribes were paid to secure votes for the hosting rights to the tournament.

2020-04-09;Swiss banks bow to pressure to delay half of dividend payments;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-economy_swiss-banks-bow-to-pressure-to-delay-half-of-dividend-payments/45680096;Switzerland’s two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have asked shareholders to accept a delay of several months for half of their dividend payments this year. The move follows a request from the financial regulator to hold on to more cash during the coronavirus pandemic. Both banks now want to split the distribution of dividends, each worth hundreds of millions of francs, into two tranches – the first batch to be paid out in a few weeks and the second in the autumn. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at their respective annual general meetings later this month. A release of the second batch of payments would be subject to another vote at planned extraordinary general meetings to be held later this year. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) welcomed the newsExternal link that “fits into a united and internationally coordinated effort by all concerned to meet the challenges of the Covid-19 crisis.” Finma wants the banks to hold on to cash reserves both as an enhanced buffer against possible losses and to have a greater stock of loans to issue to businesses struggling to keep afloat during the coronavirus-enforced shut down. Switzerland is not the only country asking banks to hold back. Several banks in Britain have stopped dividend payments altogether under pressure from the Bank of England. The European Central Bank and regulators in European countries have also demanded restraint. Credit Suisse said it wants to split its intended CHF678 millionExternal link ($698 million) dividend payment into two installments, each worth CHF0.1388 per share. UBS also divided its proposed CHF0.73 per share payment into two equal tranches worth CHF0.365 per shareExternal link. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

She's been working for the ‘Ärztefon’ for two years now, and has witnessed the increasing worry among people about the coronavirus pandemic. ‘Ärztefon’ is canton Zürich’s medical helpline that operates 24/7. The coronavirus pandemic has meant that the number of phone calls it receives has increased massively - reaching 1,200 calls a day. Some callers want to have their symptoms assessed, while others just need to be reassured that they haven’t been exposed to the virus.  “What I like about my job is that I can help people,” says Claudia Baur. “I’m a very communicative person, therefore I like working over the phone. I’m happy to listen and to be there for people. And I try to take everyone who calls seriously, even when they just have trivial questions.”  The helpline is free to call and there is no charge for professional advice. After a first assessment, if necessary or requested, medical assistants put callers in contact with a doctor or specialist. The service has been operating since January 2018.

2020-04-09;Hit hard by coronavirus, Swiss hotels weigh survival options;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economic-fallout_hit-hard-by-coronavirus--swiss-hotels-weigh-survival-options/45679800;"With ski resorts closed and travel effectively banned, hotel bookings in Switzerland dropped by 90% in April, leaving the sector in a difficult position. Under the government measures imposed in late March, hotels, in contrast to restaurants and non-essential shops, may still receive guests, provided they comply with rules on hygiene and social distancing. But bookings have dropped so dramatically that they have had to weigh up whether it is worth staying open. According to a survey of hotel owners by the Haute Ecole du Valais, 57% of establishments in the country have since closed and 21% have partially closed. The survey also found bookings fell by 69% in March, 90% in April and 73% in May. Hotel owners surveyed estimate their risk of bankruptcy to be about 23%. Frank Fleury, who manages some Ibis and Novotel hotels in the French-speaking part of the country, told the Keystone-SDA news agency that “a hotel costs money, since there are many annual contracts with suppliers. Closing would only be worthwhile if the occupancy rate fell below 5%.” He said this was not the case in March, although bookings were down 70%; they are also down 98% for April. Even with other cost cutting measures, including putting some employees on short-term work, “we lost several hundred thousand francs,” says Fleury. Another survey by the BAK Economics thinktank found that the hotel and restaurant sector is one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. It estimates that added value in the hotel and restaurant industry will drop by a fifth in 2020, compared with 2.5% for the economy as a whole. According to the research institute, hotels are likely to be harder hit than restaurants, since they are heavily affected by international travel, which may not benefit from an easing of measures locally. Another survey from late March estimated that the hotel sector could lose CHF2 billion between March and May. Andreas Züllig, President of the Swiss Hotel AssociationExternal link, told CNN Money Switzerland that he predicts 5% of Swiss hotels – from 200 to 250 – won’t survive the pandemic. Those with less than a dozen rooms face the most difficulties, he said. Hotels have different approaches to dealing with the wave of cancellations, according to the Valais survey. Fleury says that they have been reimbursing guests on a case by case basis. “Refunding all cancellations could have exposed us to cash flow problems,” he says. Sometimes bookings were pushed to another date, but this isn’t possible in all cases. At the Hotel Schweizerhof in Lucerne, all guests were required to pay the cancellation fee – according to conditions in the contract – but were refunded half of these charges in vouchers to be used for a hotel stay at a later point. When the cancellation is due to the cancellation of an event in connection with the government regulations, the hotel issued vouchers for the entire cost of the stay. “The legal issues surrounding cancellations are complex. You have to assess each individual case,” said Karin Sieber, spokesperson for Hôtellerie Suisse. She adds that it remains possible to charge a guest if they are able to arrive, and if the hotel is able to offer its services. If a guest decides to cancel a booking because a ski resort is closed, this may be an understandable but not a legally valid reason to receive reimbursement, according to Sieber. And in most cases, pandemic-related losses are not covered by insurance, she says. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-09;New debt relief measures on the horizon for struggling firms;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_new-debt-relief-measures-on-the-horizon-for-struggling-firms/45679164;The Swiss government is examining plans to stave off bankruptcies of companies struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus crisis. But regular debt collection procedures will resume on April 20. Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the aim was to stabilise the economy and to secure jobs. “It is key for the government to prevent or keep to a minimum job losses and bankruptcies,” she told a news conference on Thursday. The government will now consider the possibility of introducing a longer grace period for SMEs to pay off debts, or allowing businesses to hold off on filing for insolvency if they are threatened with coronavirus-related problems, provided there is a chance their debt problems can be resolved after the crisis. The specific measures will be announced by the government next week. Keller-Sutter made it clear that the measures were aimed at businesses who were in good financial health before the arrival of the coronavirus epidemic – that is, those whose problems are directly linked to the fallout from the crisis. The pausing of debt procedures initially came into effect on March 19, three days after all non-essential businesses in the country were ordered to close as part of nationwide restrictions. Keller-Sutter said the temporary suspension of debt procedures was not appropriate as long-term instruments, and would not be extended beyond April 20. Similar steps have been taken by other European countries, she said. Keller-Sutter also referred to a freeze at the beginning of the First World War in Switzerland, which had a negative impact on the general motivation of companies to meet their debts.   Civil and administrative courts, whose work was also paused over the past month, will also return to action on April 20.  In order to help them work through the current situation, new procedures including video- and tele-conferencing can be used, the justice ministry announcedExternal link. The announcement comes a day after the government extended all other emergency measures – the closure of businesses, schools, and non-essential activity – until April 26. After that date, it will examine how to begin easing measures. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-09;What are the long-term effects of school closures?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education_what-are-the-long-term-effects-of-school-closures-/45666358; Concerns have been raised that pupils, particularly those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, might fall behind in their learning due to the schools being in coronavirus shutdown. Inequality could rise, experts say. Schools in Switzerland are currently closed to April 26 and even longer in some cantons. The closure, decided by the federal government, was an unprecedented step for Switzerland (as cantons are usually in charge and make decisions on educational matters). + Read why the government finally took the decision to close schools The government has already indicated that could be a gradual loosening of some, as yet unspecified, corona restrictions at the end of the month. It is due to discuss which measures in its meeting of April 16.  + Here's what the government had to say on April 8External link Around one million pupils are affected by school closures. The aim is for them to be studying at home, using worksheets, online platforms and video conference lessons, as we have previously reported in our first story on schools coping with corona closures. But not all pupils benefit from the same level of support at home. For migrant families in particular, the situation can be challenging, as Swiss public television SRF has reportedExternal link. It profiled Ingrid from Langnau am Albis near Zurich, who came to Switzerland with her family from Colombia four years ago. The diligent pupil learns at home for four hours a day, but encounters problems when she doesn’t understand something. “For example, my father doesn’t understand much German, I try and translate for him, but when he still doesn’t understand, I write to my teacher,” Ingrid explained. Her mother, who is still going out to work as a cleaning lady, added that although she, her husband, and the teachers were doing their best to support Ingrid, she was still worried about her daughter’s future. Beat A. Schwendimann, board member of the German-speaking Federation of Swiss teachers (LCH),External link said that teachers across the country were doing their best to minimise the disruptive effects of the pandemic, “but remote learning cannot provide a comprehensive replacement for all aspects of school learning”. “Not all subjects can be remotely taught at the same standards of quality. Depending on their parents’ work situation as well as their level of education and language, students receive varying amounts of support at home. Also, not all students have current technological equipment available or a quiet place to work. This further contributes to already existing inequality among pupils.” The inequality issue in Switzerland pre-dates the corona pandemic. It has been flagged up by the OECDExternal link several times in its PISA global assessment of 15-year-old pupils. It is a well-known fact in Switzerland that children of academic parents are more likely to get into baccalaureate school, which prepares pupils for university, than those whose parents have a lower level of education (50.6% of pupils versus 12.2%, according to figures quoted by SRFExternal link.) + Foreigners suffer disadvantage in school career Also suffering from the school closures are pupils with special needs who no longer get the same support, like speech therapy, as they normally would under Switzerland’s inclusive schooling system. + Inclusive education proves a success “Teachers try to individually support students remotely,” Schwendimann said in email comments. “School social workers are in contact with families to provide support. However, it is difficult to provide adequate remote support for students with migrant backgrounds or special needs students. Politicians are tasked to develop fair solutions that take these extraordinary circumstances into account.” The problem is that no one knows yet just how long the nationwide closure will last. It may become clearer after the government's meeting of April 16.  + Read the latest on the coronavirus in Switzerland here, including the latest figures Some experts have previously suggested that schools could be closed until the summer. There has even been the suggestion, made in a newspaper interview by a leading teacher in canton Zurich, that pupils might have to repeat the year if this were to be the case – but not all educational experts agree with this. It should be possible to catch up their learning loss with teachers’ help, they argue. What is already clear is that the school year 2019/2020 will be counted as such and not be extended in any way, as the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Education Ministers (EDK) stated on April 2. Pupils will get the note “no classroom teaching, corona pandemic” in their school records and secondary students will receive their diplomas. Child protection representatives have been worrying about the mental and physical effects on children during the pandemic. “Children are the hidden victims of the pandemic,” said UNICEF Switzerland’s head Bettina Junker on SRFExternal link. Their rights to education, to meet up with other children, freedom and play are all being affected. The organisation Child Protection Switzerland has raised concerns of more domestic violence aimed at children as tensions rise during the lockdown. It and other organisations working in the field have called for schools to be reopened sooner rather than later, arguing that schools have a “control role” for flagging up at-risk children. A gradual opening of schools, starting with small groups of primary children could be a solution, it has been suggested. However, education experts say this would be hard to put into practice.

2020-04-08;Swiss government extends coronavirus measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-government-extends-coronavirus-measures/45677998;"The government has extended the anti-coronavirus restrictions in place for another week until April 26. But it said it plans to examine an easing of measures at the end of the month.  The Covid-19 epidemic has spread widely in Switzerland but the speed at which it is spreading has slowed significantly in recent days, the government said on Wednesday. The measures put in place to combat the virus are being followed well by the public and are having the desired effect, according to President Simonetta Sommaruga and Interior Minister Alain Berset. “After four weeks the situation has evolved favourably,” Berset told a news conference. “So, we’ve decided to extend the measures until April 26 and to proceed to the first loosening of some measures in some sectors.” We are on the right path, but we haven't reached the finishing line, Sommaruga added.  A decision on the specific areas and measures to be relaxed will be presented on April 16, the government said in a statementExternal link. For the successful phase-out, certain requirements must be fulfilled, Berset explained. These include a steady downward trend in number of new infections, hospitalisations and the death rate. The situation in neighbouring countries will also be an important factor, according to Berset. Switzerland remains one of the countries most affected by the coronavirus, with more than 22,500 positive tests and more than 850 deaths in a population of 8.5 million. Berset said virus case figures were still rising but in recent days there had been fewer daily infections and the number of people needing hospital treatment had stabilised. “We are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel, but discipline and patience is needed, especially during Easter when people must stay at home. We must continue on this path for the next few weeks,” he declared.  The interior minister stressed that the population must continue to respect social distancing and hygiene measures, which are being well implemented and are working. “We need to maintain these measures; this is the condition by which we will be able to return to normal progressively,” he said.  On March 16, the government declared the coronavirus pandemic an “extraordinary situation”, instituting a ban on all private and public events and ordering the closure of bars, restaurants, sports facilities and cultural spaces across the country.  Only businesses providing essential goods to the population – such as grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, banks and post offices – are allowed to remain open. On the education front, schools are also closed nationwide.  Switzerland could suffer its worst economic downturn on record, the government said on Wednesday, with the coronavirus epidemic shrinking the economy by as much as 10.4% this year. The scenario, far worse than the government's previous forecast of a 1.5% contraction, would occur if there was a prolonged shutdown in Switzerland and as well as abroad, triggering bankruptcies and job cuts. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said the economy had been shaken by the virus and restrictions introduced to keep it from spreading. He said nearly a third of the country's workforce was on short-time work and unemployed numbers were on the rise. The scenarios...are gloomy, he told a news conference. The health impact of the coronavirus has been a concern for the Swiss government, but so has the effect on the economy. It's important we all do everything so that people in this country can work, despite the virus. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-08;Swiss group says machines can conduct 30m virus antibody tests;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-breakthrough_swiss-group-says-machines-can-conduct-30m-virus-antibody-tests/45676482;A Swiss medical diagnostics company has said it is ready to ship high-capacity machines capable of more than 30m clinically accurate coronavirus antibody tests this year. Eysins-based Quotient said its tests were ready for immediate use thanks to years of work developing a new serological screening machine, which it had intended to launch this summer. They will now be available from next week. Over the past month Quotient has adapted the machines to test for coronavirus antibodies. Each machine can conduct 3,000 tests a day.  Experts say antibody testing will be a critical part of easing lockdowns around the world as countries seek to restart economies ravaged by the pandemic. Antibody screening identifies who has already been exposed to the virus and developed immunity — a group likely to include millions of asymptomatic individuals and mild sufferers of Covid-19.  Quotient chief executive Franz Walt warned that the world was facing major shortages of the critical components needed to make the tests, amid widespread supply chain disruption and government hoarding.  “Demand for antibody testing is going to be absolutely enormous in the next couple of months,” said Mr Walt. “I think we are a trailblazer here, but I really hope that more than one of us is moving on this because even we do not have the capacity to meet demand. “There is a real shortage of supply of secondary reagents, biomarkers, specialised spare parts [for testing machines] and their components from China . . . supply chains are badly disrupted.”  Even well-resourced companies will take months to ramp up antibody testing, he added.  Mr Walt was the managing director of the Singapore-based Roche laboratory that developed the first diagnostic case for Sars in 2003: “I hoped I would never see a similar virus again in my life, but here we are.” Two US companies have also said they have developed antibody tests for coronavirus, but have given no firm date as to when they will be available for use. New Jersey-based medical technology company BD has said it will make 1m antibody tests available in the coming months. Many governments had in recent days warned that accurate antibody testing could take weeks to develop, after several experimental antibody testing kits acquired in huge quantities by some in the early stages of the pandemic were found to be diagnostically useless. The UK government on Monday discarded 17.5m faulty tests for Sars-CoV-2 antibodies it bought in March.  Mr Walt said he was in discussions with health authorities in the US, the UK, Spain and Switzerland. Quotient will sell its testing machines, called MosaiQ, at cost from next week. Each test for the novel coronavirus will then cost between $15 and $25 to conduct. The machines are mainly designed to conduct multiple simultaneous screenings, said Mr Walt. Each can screen for up to 120 different pathogens or conditions simultaneously, using special cells that have had dozens of micro-doses of custom-chosen reagents printed on them. Mr Walt added that, based on Quotient’s capacity to manufacture the machines, it could conduct more than 30m tests this year. Rules around medical marketing forbid Quotient from disclosing its data on the diagnostic success of its Sars-CoV-2 test, but Mr Walt pointed to the company’s recent public field trials of syphilis and HIV tests — which diagnosed 100 per cent of infections and gave a false positive in only 0.3 per cent of cases — as evidence of the system’s reliability.

2020-04-08;How are Swiss schools and pupils coping with closures?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education-_how-are-schools-and-pupils-coping-with-closures-/45662396; It has been over three weeks since Swiss schools were closed nationwide to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Teachers, pupils and parents have had to adapt quickly to homeschooling. A challenge for all. The government’s unprecedented announcement on March 13 that all schools would close from the following Monday until April 19 - although mooted beforehand - still came as a shock. In some cantons the measure continues until the end of the month.  On April 8, the government said that the nationwide anti-coronavirus restrictions would be extended until April 26, but that there are plans for a gradual loosening of some measures from the end of the month. The government said it would discuss what would be covered by this during its next meeting on April 16. Interior Minister Alain Berset did say howeverExternal link that schools were in the middle of the list and that primary schools would be treated differently than universities. The goal is to exit as fast as possible without endangering the favourable development to health. In the meanwhile, around one million children and young people are currently affected by school closures. + More on why Switzerland changed its mind and closed schools here Teachers and schools have been working around the clock to find solutions for remote learning, as each school needs to provide an age-appropriate solution to deliver remote learning content and stay in touch with their students, explained Beat A. Schwendimann, board member of the German-speaking Federation of Swiss teachers (LCH).External link “Many teachers now hold daily videoconferences with their students, send material electronically or in the mail, and assign activities that students can do at home,” he told swissinfo.ch in email comments. “The current situation reveals that not all schools and teachers are equally well prepared for remote learning. While some schools already have been using technology-supported learning tools for some time, other schools have to catch up with building their infrastructure and training their teachers.” Over the past week, both public institutions and companies have started offering phone and online support and training for teachers, he added. The Schwyz University of Teacher Education, for example, has made a LernenTrotzCoronaExternal link (learning despite corona) platform in which experts have posted advice on topics such as how to structure school work during distance learning or ideas for projects. Demand has been high from teachers, parents and pupils. (250,000 accesses in 14 days). The Swiss union of French-speaking teachers has also pointed to helpful resourcesExternal link, while Rahel Tschopp, head of media education and computer science centre at the Zurich University of Teacher Education, has set up a free hotlineExternal link offering advice for teachers on lessons and managing home working. It has 15 people manning the phones and demand is also high, she told Swiss public television SRF. Another issue is the question of exams, which is especially important for students in their final year. A coordinated, political decision needs to be made soon regarding exams and graduations, added Schwendimann. Some cantons have decided to hold exams under the health authorities’ social distancing conditions, but not oral exams, for example. Parents report that their children are managing to get their allotted work done, but that there are challenges. Primary school pupils are getting worksheets to do via post or have been picking them up from the school (at staggered, allotted times to avoid other pupils). Some pupils are already using existing online tools. Kindergarten children are being allotted “homework”, such as regular exercises to do such as counting or learning songs. Teachers are remaining in contact via WhatsApp, email and phone. In general, parents have been impressed by the diligence of their teachers: for example, one parent reported that they had a communication from the school on the evening the closures were announced, saying that there would be remote lessons from the following Wednesday. The main challenges were the amount of supervision needed for younger children while learning and the difficulty of working parents fitting this in around their schedules. “It’s exhausting,” several parents agreed. Older pupils are quote often being given online lessons, which means logging in to a conference tool at a certain time (and being told off if you overslept!). Pupils say they have had to adapt pretty quickly to this new way of working. There have been reports of crashing software when everyone is online at the same time using the same tool, and a lot of time spent scanning and emailing in work. One pupil said she was spending less time learning overall though as she was more concentrated. In addition, many children are missing their friends and usual activities. “My children say they would prefer to be at school,” admitted one parent to swissinfo.ch. However, another parent reported that their child was learning more independently than before, which they feel is a useful skill for the world of work. Distance learning may well be something that parents, teachers and pupils will have to get used to - given that the coronavirus is still very much present in Switzerland. + Click here for all the latest figures and news on the coronavirus in Switzerland Silvia Steiner, head of education in Zurich and head of the cantonal conference of education directors - cantons are in charge of educational matters in Switzerland, which is why the government-ordered nationwide closure was so exceptional - has already mooted that closures could last longer – maybe as far as the summer. “We are planning to be ready if measures to be extended,” she told the NZZ am Sonntag in mid MarchExternal link. Scientists have pointed to 3-4 months for an easing of the pandemic, she said. Media reports had suggested there would be an announcementExternal link on schools before Easter, however no clear update has been made. More information could come after the government discusses relaxing certain anti-coronavirus measures in its next meeting of April 16. Experts have already raised the prospect of learning loss, due to lack of schooling. Another issue is that not all pupils have access to the right conditions and parental support for homeschooling (watch out for our article on this). In the meanwhile, it looks like digital learning will be here to stay after the coronavirus passes. Tschopp, of the teachers’ hotline, has observed something of a sea change in attitudes among teachers over digital learning and this may provide some impetus for the future. “Many are starting to really think: how can I do it differently than before?” Tschopp said.

2020-04-07;Swiss concern shifts to economic fallout of coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-monitor_swiss-concern-shifts-to-economic-fallout-of-coronavirus/45671640;Concerns over a Swiss health system crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic is giving way to worries about the economy, according to a nationwide opinion poll.  The latest survey commissioned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation also shows that a vast majority of the Swiss follow government measures, but they seem to become increasingly impatient.  “Respondents said they take the regulations about social distancing seriously,” says Michael Hermann, director of the Sotomo research instituteExternal link, which carried out the poll. “But with the immediate health threat gone, people begin to get itchy feet and even bored.” The survey, published on Tuesday, found that more than nine out of ten people left their homes  regularly defying government recommendations, but that figure is somewhat misleading, says Hermann.  A closer look reveals that elderly respondents refrained from going shopping and drastically reduced personal contact with friends and families. And there’s been a dramatic drop in the use of public transport in Switzerland.  The assessment of personal danger presented by the virus has remained largely unchanged compared with a previous poll presented two weeks ago.  But concerns about a collapse of the country’s health system appear to have eased. Nearly 70% of respondents are optimistic that Swiss hospitals can cope with the number of patients. This figure is up from just 25% in March.  Three weeks into a standstill of public life, including restrictions of personal freedoms, and a partial lockdown of the economy, an increasing number of people said they would like to see an easing of the strict rules.  A reopening of shops with non-essential goods is top of the list, ahead of calls for schools to resume classes.  However, the comprehensive survey found significant differences between Switzerland’s majority German and the minority French as well as the Italian-speaking regions.  “Overall the virtual divide between the regions has narrowed notably over the confidence in the Swiss government, but conflicts are looming about schools and shops reopening,” says Hermann.  In the first online poll in March, respondents from the French and the Italians-speaking regions were a lot more critical of the government over its allegedly slow and inadequate response to the spreading epidemic.  More than 40% of respondents, notably in the German-speaking part of the country want the government to ease restrictions after April 19 – five weeks after they were imposed as part of the government’s special powers.  Only 13% came out in favour of tightening the measures and 37% of respondents said the current curbs should stay in place.  The regions hardest hit by the epidemic – Ticino, which borders northern Italy, and western Switzerland, with cultural ties to neighbouring France – both favour a harsher policy, notably limiting access to certain tourist hotspots during the coming Easter holidays.  What’s more surprising is the fact that younger respondents also agree with a strong-hand approach of the government, while the older generation hopes for more liberal regulations.  “It appears that older people begin to lose their inner calm and poise,” says Hermann. “They want their freedom back. This will add pressure on the government to respond.”  Similar differences can be found over a proposal to make face masks mandatory for people in shops.  The issue of face masks has been controversial since the Covid-19 pandemic reached Switzerland at the end of February. While the health authorities continue to doubt the practical effects of wearing masks in public, scientist are divided amid persistent rumors of a shortage of medical material.  Besides the issue of masks, two out of three survey respondents said they were willing to use a contact tracing app to help stem the spread of Covid-19.  The result is encouraging, says Hermann, but admits that the government will still have some way to go to convince a big enough number of citizens to take part in a voluntary project.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-07;Swiss economy could lose up to CHF35 billion to pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-cost_swiss-economy-could-lose-up-to-chf35-billion-to-pandemic/45674726;Coronavirus will cost the Swiss economy CHF22 billion ($22.7 billion) in lost productivity in the best-case scenario, economists have warned. Losses could easily mount up to CHF35 billion between March and June. A nationwide lockdown of non-essential high street shops and services has been accompanied by partial closures of industrial plants in some cantons. The KOF Swiss Economic InstituteExternal link calculates a productivity shortfall of CHF1.2 billion per week. The retail, transport and hospitality sectors in particular are suffering from the consequences of the pandemic. Much of the cost is being caused by the closure of companies and the effects of workers getting ill or being in quarantine, says KOF. But 44%-71% of the negative economic consequences of Covid-19 are likely to be caused by disruptions in trade with other countries. “Even if the current strategy is successfully implemented, the economic costs for Switzerland will be largely determined by the international environment,” said Jan-Egbert Sturm, director of KOF. “Unless the crisis is contained globally, the economic problems in Switzerland will remain severe.” The Swiss lockdown which began on March 17 will continue until at least April 19. But on Tuesday top Swiss health official Daniel Koch warned that “we are only halfway there, maximum.” KOF has previously called on the government to do more to protect the economy during the pandemic. The government has so far set aside more than CHF60 billion to cover lost wages, issue emergency loans to companies and inject emergency funding into specific sectors.

2020-04-07;Donations to Covid-19 fundraiser top CHF15 million;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-solidarity_donations-to-covid-19-fundraiser-top-chf15-million/45673748;The humanitarian charity Swiss Solidarity has raised CHF15 million ($15.3 million) in the first two weeks of a campaign to help vulnerable sections of society during the coronavirus pandemic. The humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation had launched its latest campaign on March 23. It is calling for financial help to support the elderly and the homeless, as well as people in need who struggle to cope with dramatic income losses due to the restrictions ordered by the government. Despite the success of the campaign so far, Swiss Solidarity said more money is still needed as demand from vulnerable sections of society continues to build up. The money is being distributed to those in need by social partners such as Caritas, Pro Senectute and the Swiss section of the Red Cross. “There are 630,000 people living in poverty in Switzerland,” Caritas director Hugo Fasel told Swiss public broadcaster SRFExternal link. Caritas provides food vouchers and distributes up to CHF1,000 in direct aid from Swiss Solidarity donations. The charity appealed for continued community efforts and contributions via their website or their postal payment account 10-15000-6, using the reference “Coronavirus”. Since it was established 74 years ago, Swiss Solidarity has collected more than CHF1.8 billion in public donations to fund projects both in Switzerland and abroad, including CHF34.7 million last year.

2020-04-07;Italy ‘steals’ hand gel destined for Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-disinfectant_italy--steals--hand-gel-destined-for-switzerland/45673608;Italy has blocked a lorry at its border and confiscated disinfectant en route to Switzerland. The Swiss commercial transport association is talking of “state theft”, and Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis has reportedly intervened.  Swiss company Victory Switzerland imports items from all over the world. Since last week, however, Italy has been holding a lorry with its paid-for products at the Swiss-Italian border at Domodossola.  Victory Switzerland’s managing director, Daniel Gerber, told swissinfo.ch that the lorry was carrying disinfectant hand gel, which Italian customs officials confiscated “on the spot”.  The Italian customs authorities justified the seizure on the authority of a special coronavirus emergency decree. According to the document they have given to hauliers, the goods are delivered to the civil defence unit based in Domodossola, which distributes them to hospitals and municipalities as needed.  Victory Switzerland had ordered the products from German company Gifts & Beauty Handels and paid more than CHF30,000 ($30,800) for them three weeks ago. However, they were manufactured in Italy.  According to the Italian authorities, the manufacturers or sellers of the confiscated products would be compensated. Gerber hopes it can claim the CHF30,000 back from the German company. However, he said he would have to write off the costs for the transport that hadn’t been completed plus lost profits.  Victory Switzerland had experienced the same problem in Hamburg at the beginning of March, when the German authorities held back 314,000 protective masks on their way to Switzerland from China. Following Swiss intervention, the German government released the shipment two days later.  The problem with Italy has become a top priority for the Swiss commercial transport association, ASTAG. Its president, Adrian Amstutz, a former senior member of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, has personally taken up the cause of the Swiss companies affected and has used his direct line to the federal parliament.  “The Italian-speaking foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, who is responsible for this, is now taking care of the matter,” he told swissinfo.ch.  Amstutz said he was outraged by his neighbour’s “high-handed seizure of medical products ordered and paid for by Switzerland”.  “This is state theft,” he said, taking the opportunity to rail against Switzerland’s bilateral accords with the European Union.  “This shows the value of these highly praised agreements with the EU. Like Schengen/Dublin they are fair-weather constructs that don’t work, especially in times of crisis when it really matters.”  Amstutz explained that hauliers were obviously interested in having borders that are as open as possible for freight traffic, but for this to happen, the countries concerned would have to talk directly to each other – as is now becoming clear – and not via Brussels.  The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) confirmed to swissinfo.ch that it was aware of the case and was in contact with the Italian authorities.

2020-04-07;Balancing hope and science in the search for a coronavirus cure;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/hydroxychloroquine_balancing-hope-and-science-in-search-for-covid-19-cure/45671352;The controversy surrounding the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine epitomises the challenges faced by corporates in balancing politicians’ desires to offer hope on the one hand and scientific realities on the other. Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan recently told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper that, of its portfolio, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine offered the best hope in the fight against Covid-19. “Pre-clinical studies in animals as well as the first data from clinical studies show that hydroxychloroquine kills the coronavirus,” Narasimhan said. As Novartis’ Sandoz division is one of the largest makers of the drug, the statement naturally created some buzz amid a mad search for a treatment for the virus that has infected more than one million people worldwide. Big pharma has been treading a fine line between giving hope and ensuring safety, recognising that in normal times, much more rigorous scientific testing would be required before companies would put anything on the market. But these are anything but normal times. As patients run out of options, some doctors are turning to hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, and reporting some positive results. This has led to enthusiastic remarks by US President Donald Trump that have left some epidemiologists uneasy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the drug emergency use authorisationExternal link for Covid-19 patients, but European authorities have been much more reticentExternal link to encourage use of the drug. The Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases has included hydroxychloroquine as one of the antiviral treatmentsExternal link for consideration in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. This paved the way for Novartis to make Switzerland the second countryExternal link, after the US, to receive part of the 130 million doses its subsidiary Sandoz has committed to donate as part of its coronavirus response. Another Switzerland-based company, Mepha, the generics arm of Teva pharmaceuticals, also announced on Friday a donation of 90,000 dosesExternal link to Swiss hospitals for “seriously ill and hospitalised patients . Hydroxychloroquine (along with chloroquine) is one of four drugs that are being studied in World Health Organization Solidarity clinical trials. One key advantage of the drug is that it’s cheap, readily available and familiar. HydroxychloroquineExternal link was approved for use by the US FDA in 1955 and has been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The trouble is that the evidence of its benefits against Covid-19 is still patchy. A Novartis spokesperson told swissinfo.ch that “although there is no approved treatment for Covid-19 today, hydroxychloroquine has shown promise in early studies in vitro”, citing a studyExternal link out of China from early February. But success in a petri dish doesn’t necessarily spell success in humans, as researchers learned when they tested chloroquine during the 2002-03 SARS outbreakExternal link and against other viruses such as dengueExternal link. Much of the excitement and hope in the drug this time around has come from limited studiesExternal link and anecdotal evidenceExternal link from doctors and patients. Small clinical studiesExternal link, some with randomised control groupExternal links, are emerging, particularly in France and China, with mixed results in how quickly patients recovered and how the disease progressed. David Reddy, CEO of Medicines for Malaria Venture, a Geneva-based research foundation that has developed over 10 antimalarial drugs to date, says there is still a lot we don’t know. “We still have more questions than answers about the drug’s effectiveness against the virus today,” Reddy, the former leader of Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche’s Influenza Pandemic Taskforce, told swissinfo.ch. “The moves people are making are pragmatic. We need to learn as we go because we don’t have a full picture yet.” Some Swiss hospitalsExternal link in the University Hospital in Geneva have started using hydroxychloroquine for certain patientsExternal link. Chloroquine holds well-known risks, particularly for anyone with a heart condition. What Reddy worries about most is this turning into the wild West with the medicine being used off-label without scientific evidence of its safety and efficacy against Covid-19. It’s important to understand the dose at which the drug could be effective, safe and lower the chance of drug resistance, he says. Chloroquine resistanceExternal link has diminished its use to treat some types of malaria such as P. falciparum. However, the drug remains critical for the treatment of P. vivax, relapsing malaria, and for malaria prevention. There are other knock-on effects that concern Reddy. There have been reports of people self-medicating and then overdosingExternal link. Fake packagesExternal link of the drug have also started popping up in places. There are already reportsExternal link of more requests from hospitals and hoarding by doctors, creating shortages for patients who take the medicine on a regular basis. Both the lupus and rheumatoid arthritis leagues in Switzerland have reported bottlenecksExternal link in the supply of Plaquenil, the brand name version of the drug. They say they are working with cantonal medical services to ensure adequate supply.  Reddy cautions that even if the drug shows promise it is still a prescription medicine that must be used under medical supervision. Self-medicating with chloroquine may do more harm than good. In addition, he says there are patients who take these drugs every day for chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. “To take this vital drug away from people who need it, that’s inappropriate.” The drug also poses more practical challenges for companies like Novartis, one of which is manufacturing capacity. As with many older drugs, such as antibiotics, manufacturing has moved to cheaper locations such as India, which recently announced restrictionsExternal link on the export of hydroxychloroquine. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) production is highly concentrated in Asia among a very small group of suppliers, particularly for chloroquine. Any disruptions in production could create problems in sourcing for finished drug production. Novartis told swissinfo.ch last week that its hydroxychloroquine manufacturing takes place in the US and is now working 24/7 to increase capacity. “We are also exploring further scaling of capacity to increase supply should the medicine prove effective.” The company added that it had enough API, which it sources from a third party, to produce all the 130 million doses it plans to donate. While the company is honouring existing commercial orders in the US, it is not accepting new commercial orders. All remaining quantities are earmarked for donation. Companies also take a risk ramping up production without clear evidence of the drug’s effectiveness. Outside of the US, this medicine is available for donation only. As of Monday, Novartis had submitted approval applications to the authorities in around ten other European countries.The company recently scrapped a deal to sell offExternal link its US generics division, that would have included hydroxychloroquine, amid greater investment in innovative, potentially more profitable medicines. But the real balancing act for companies is their communication. Governments are desperate to find a silver bullet, and any hint from pharmaceutical companies that they may be on to something can easily get swooped up. Companies know they have an important role and responsibility in this pandemic, Reddy says. “The biggest enemy right now is the hype.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-07;Has Switzerland got enough hospital beds? ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis-_has-switzerland-got-enough-hospital-beds--/45671704;"In many countries the number of hospital beds has decreased in recent years. This could be problematic during the coronavirus crisis. Here’s an overview of the situation in Switzerland. Because of Covid-19, healthcare facilities worldwide are under severe pressure. Many countries are struggling to stop the spread of the virus to prevent hospitals from being overloaded. Switzerland has one of the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases per capita. Hospitals therefore face a major challenge. As the above chart shows, the number of hospital beds available per 100,000 inhabitants in acute care has fallen steadily in recent years. One reason is that the total number of this type of hospital bed is decreasing slightly every year. On the other hand, the constantly growing resident population in Switzerland plays a role. Even if the absolute number of beds remained the same, fewer and fewer beds would be available per resident.  Switzerland is not alone in this downward trend. Hospital beds are being cut throughout Europe. Outside Europe, too, there are only a few exceptions in this trend of eliminating hospital beds. The most striking example is South Korea, which now has considerably more beds in acute care than it did ten years ago. Looking at the latest available figures for the OECD countries, Switzerland falls in the middle in terms of the number of hospital beds per capita – similar to Estonia, Greece or Luxembourg. Japan and South Korea have considerably more capacity; in these countries, more than twice as many beds per inhabitant are available in hospitals.  Many questions currently revolve around the capacity of intensive care units. This data is more difficult to obtain and the figures probably vary greatly depending on the situation. Nevertheless, a group of scientists has taken the trouble to collect these figures for Europe in 2012. They are shown in the following graph. In 2012, the number of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) in Switzerland was slightly below the European average. The front-runner was Germany, with over 2.5 times as many beds per person as Switzerland. Portugal and Sweden came in last. Both have less than half as many intensive care beds as Switzerland. The figures have certainly changed since 2012. However, they are roughly in line with the figures announced by individual governments at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. The proportions are therefore likely to apply roughly to the period before the outbreak of the pandemic. However, many countries are in the process of upgrading their ICUs in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Switzerland is receiving support from the military. In addition, a Swiss manufacturer has supplied 900 ventilators. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-07;Swiss job market shows first signs of Covid-19 pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/unemployment-figures_swiss-job-market-shows-first-signs-of-covid-19-pandemic/45673082;The Swiss labour market in March felt the first effects of coronavirus. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) put the unemployment rate at 2.9%, up from 2.5% in February.  Adjusted for seasonal factors, the rate was 2.8%, SECO said on TuesdayExternal link. Economists interviewed by news agency AWP had expected such figures.  At the end of March a total of 135,624 people were registered as unemployed with regional employment centres. This was 17,802 more than in the previous month.  The latest figures on short-time working had also been eagerly awaited, but currently only the data for January are available. According to SECO, 3,717 people were affected in January, an increase of 13% over the previous month of December.  The number of companies affected was 178, some 26 more than in December. The number of working hours lost is reported at 189,157 – 34,622 (22.4%) more than in December.  Meanwhile, at the end of March the head of the SECO labour unit, Boris Zürcher, said applications for short-time work were rocketing: 570,000 applications from 42,000 companies. This corresponds to about 11% of the workforce. Just one day later Economics Minister Guy Parmelin put the figures at 51,000 companies and around 656,000 employees.  I believe unemployment will clearly increase, Zürcher said.  The longer this situation lasts, the harder it is to get out. If it continues like this for another three or four months, it will also affect solvent companies. The unemployment rate among foreigners rose in March to 5.2% (up from 4.6%) and among Swiss nationals to 2.1% (1.8%).  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Another flight arrived in Geneva and more are expected in the coming days. The personal protective gear arrived at Zurich Airport on Sunday evening from Shanghai. The supplies will be distributed to 34 healthcare institutions in the cantons of Zurich and Schwyz. Another flight landed on Monday in Geneva  carrying 92 tonnes of protective medical equipment including masks made in China, Reuters reported. That flight contained 2.5 million surgical masks, 10 million gloves as well as goggles and thermometers. The equipment will be distributed to 13 Swiss hospitals and pharmaceutical associations. Additional protective materials such as masks, gloves and safety glasses are expected to arrive in the coming days, according to SWISS International Airlines. With coronavirus continuing to spread in Switzerland, doctors have warned of a pending lack of protective gear for medical staff, especially masks. Switzerland recently introduced temporary restrictions on the export of protective equipment to head off shortages among medical staff and others fighting the coronavirus outbreak.  Last month, Brussels instructed the European Union member states to stop blocking exports of protective equipment to Switzerland and the other countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

2020-04-06;Can expat Swiss get Covid-19 financial aid?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-abroad-businesses--_can-expat-swiss-get-covid-19-financial-aid-/45670508;Many of the 770,000 Swiss citizens living around the world, especially those with businesses, face a difficult financial situation owing to the coronavirus pandemic. There are question marks over whether they are entitled to state support. The pandemic has forced many people to close their businesses, depriving them of income. While expats are still trying to get financial help from the Swiss authorities or from the governments of their countries of residence, others have decided to return home. From a legal perspective, there seems to be little hope that expatriates can claim loans from the Swiss government, which approved relief packages to the tune of CHF62 billion ($63.4 billion) since March 20 to help companies and employees cope with the crisis. “The ordinance (….) is aimed at granting timely financial aid to single-person ventures, limited partnership companies or legal entities based in Switzerland,” the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) wrote in answer to an email by Patrick Schneider. The 42-year-old Swiss emigrated with his partner to Colombia in 2018, where they opened a nail studio and a tattoo parlour in the city of Cartagena. Both ventures with nine employees have been shut but the fixed costs remain. “We don’t know what to do as our revenue has dropped to zero,” says Schneider. The SECO statement appears to confirm assumptions by the Organisation of the Swiss Abroad (OSA) that expatriates are in principle not eligible for financial aid from the Swiss government relief package. However, the OSA said it was told that requests by Swiss Abroad citizens for social benefits can be made at local embassies until the end of April, provided there are no other options.  Another open question is whether all expatriate business owners coming home can apply for loans or whether such aid is restricted to Swiss citizens returning from abroad for good. A senior SECO official indicated that temporary returnees have no legal right to the Covid-19 relief aid. The number of expatriate Swiss immigrants appears to be very limited, experts say. But the situation might change if the economic downturn forces more members of the Swiss Abroad community to reconsider their options. As for Colombia-based Schneider, he has returned to Switzerland and has taken on a temporary job. He says he’ll try to get by without financial aid from the state before he goes back to Latin America. He hopes he will be able to weather the crisis by making enough money in Switzerland to send some back to his employees in Colombia and to reopen his studios soon. Schneider, a former sports journalist and art director, is also mulling new ideas. He plans to go back to Colombia but with the idea of running an independent business that is not tied to a specific location.

2020-04-06;Can coronavirus help the environment?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-and-the-climate_can-covid-19-help-the-environment-/45670634;​​​​​​​ Less smog over China, clearer canals in Venice, better air quality in parts of Switzerland – how much is due to coronavirus measures, and can the climate benefit in the long run? In Switzerland, everything deemed non-essential has been cancelled or closed. Public transport is running at a minimum, and office workers are telecommuting whenever possible. “In urban areas we can see an effect of the lockdown measures – specifically in a reduction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2),” says Christoph Hüglin, who researches air pollution at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)External link. “But in rural areas, we don’t see an effect. The weather has been such that we already have exceptionally good air quality.” To get a sense of how the lockdown measures affected the concentrations of NO2 in March, Empa researchers compared the observed levels to predictions based on business-as-usual and meteorology. The data came from monitoring sites around the nation. In places like Bern and Lugano, there was considerably less NO2 in the air than what would have been expected. But in rural Beromünster near Lucerne, the observed level of NO2 seemed far higher than predicted. The researchers attribute this to the sensor’s relatively large distance from road traffic, the very low overall concentrations in this rural area, and the uncertainty of the model and measurements at such low values. “Aerosol levels might actually increase if people stay home. People want comfort on difficult days, so they might light wood fires, and that creates emissions,” points out Urs Baltensperger, head of the atmospheric chemistry lab at the Paul Scherrer InstituteExternal link – a part of the Swiss federal technology institutes. In addition, there was an influx of Sahara dust that blew into Switzerland in late March. These particles, along with lower temperatures and a lack of wind, can result in more clouds as well as air pollution. In a draft report on the effect of Covid-19 on Swiss air quality, the researchers at Empa conclude that nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations “have decreased in most traffic-related sites in Switzerland by up to 50% due to the lockdown measures”. They state that ozone concentrations were low but have “generally increased across Switzerland due to the inverse relationship this pollutant [ozone] has with NOx”. This shows how hard it is to draw accurate conclusions. Baltensperger says compared to NO2 observations, it’s much harder to get a sense of how the lockdown has affected the concentration of aerosols. Without a detailed analysis of a longer time period, “it’s like reading tea leaves!” If you look at satellite images showing Switzerland over the past two months, the air appears far clearer post-lockdown measures. “Nearly all of that is due to a very special weather situation. We've never had such a warm winter here,” says Lukas Emmenegger, head of Empa’s laboratory for air pollution and environmental technology. However, he and his team will be studying the satellite images more closely this month as more data on the period following the lockdown becomes available. But no matter what they discover, Switzerland could never get such impressive results as production powerhouse China – where emissions dropped dramatically during the crisis and are now on the rise again. Meanwhile, Swiss air quality has profited from Covid-19 measures taken over the border in northern Italy. This is especially true in the southern canton of Ticino, as the Federal Office for the Environment recently told Swiss public broadcaster, SRFExternal link. The decline in production as well as road and air traffic has optimists hoping that the climate can benefit once Covid-19 is under control. Greenpeace SwitzerlandExternal link, for example, has launched a petition calling for coronavirus-related economic aid to go towards a Swiss Green New Deal. “Maybe the situation that we have right now will help speed up action in areas that often have an effect on greenhouse gas emissions,” Hüglin, though he and Emmenegger worry that it will take longer than desired. On the other hand, the pandemic has pushed global warming to the back burner for many decision-makers. The longer the crisis lasts, the worse it’ll be for the environment, according to Martin Grosjean, director of the Oeschger Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bern. “For the climate it would be best if Covid-19 had never happened. Then we could have concentrated on implementing the Paris Convention,” said Grosjean in an interview with news website WatsonExternal link. The UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) – scheduled for November in Scotland – has been postponed. What do you think?

2020-04-06;Government urged to do more to help companies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economic-relief_government-urged-to-do-more-to-help-companies/45670544;The Swiss government should scale up its efforts to help businesses overcome the coronavirus crisis, according to the director of the KOF Swiss Economic InstituteExternal link. Transport companies are also calling for more assistance. “If many companies are over-indebted after the crisis, they will not invest for years,” says Jan-Egbert Sturm. Then there will be no more resources for innovation and the economy will grow less strongly. The measures taken so far to support the economy, such as shorter work hours and loans, will not be enough, he argues in an interview published on Monday by CH Media newspapersExternal link. The government should further lighten the burden on companies by, for example, covering the costs of rents or interest payments, he says. “This would be a kind of partial unemployment scheme for capital,” Sturm says. The state would not have to pay for everything, but a certain amount would be appropriate. Companies, their owners and lenders also have obligations, he adds.  “Anything we don’t do now will cost us more later,” Sturm warns. The unemployment rate in Switzerland, for example, could rise sharply. In addition, hardly any jobs are being created during the crisis and even afterwards companies will remain cautious at first. According to Sturm, Switzerland can make such a non-repayable financial contribution without exceeding the CHF100 billion ($102 billion) threshold for support measures. + Swiss finance bosses warn recession unavoidable  Public transport companies are already requesting additional subsidies from the federal government and cantonal authorities due to the heavy financial losses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, reports the Swiss news agency Keystone-SDA. In a letter to cabinet minister Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the transport portfolio, the Swiss Public Transport Association bemoans losses to the tune of several hundred million francs. These losses cannot be offset by emergency aid, short-time work compensation and the suspension of investment plans, according to the letter, dated March 26, which was published in the SonntagsZeitungExternal link newspaper. The transport association complains that most of the revenue from individual tickets is lost due to the measures taken against the pandemic. At the same time, the railways must continue to provide a basic service. In addition, season ticket holders are asking for refunds. And several transport companies are still paying full wages to employees despite shorter working hours. The association says it is impossible to calculate the additional costs and losses associated with the situation. In normal times, almost CHF500 million a month is collected through the sale of tickets and season tickets by transport companies, according to the association’s director Ueli Stückelberger, quoted in the SonntagsZeitung. Since the imposition of semi-confinement, 60-80% of this revenue has been lost, he says. On April 3, the Swiss government doubled its coronavirus emergency loan scheme to CHF40 billion after being flooded by requests for help by businesses. More than 76,000 agreements have been made. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-06;Will the United Nations soon be obsolete? ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/multilateralism-in-crisis-_will-the-united-nations-soon-be-obsolete--/45666060;"Is the international order capable of meeting the enormous challenges facing states and societies around the world? We look at the four main challenges facing International Geneva.  As the European headquarters of the United Nations, Geneva is helping mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN and 100 years since the formation of the League of Nations (LoN). Geneva is one of the two most important global centres of multilateral diplomacy together with New York. In Geneva, the challenges facing the entire planet are debated and negotiated before being sent to New York, where the states decide which options to respond to.   This organisational model for relations between states is more precious than ever; the Geneva authorities have named the celebrations #Multilateralism100. It is an unequivocal call for action at a time when the world’s policeman – the United States – continues its slide towards unilateralism, a desire for power without regard for the sovereignty of other states or for international law that governs relations. Peace: This was the raison d’être for the creation of the LoN, as it is for the UN, two organisations born from the ashes of two world wars that ravaged Europe and Asia. Each time, the victors of these two international conflicts wanted to establish a judicial framework based on man’s right to self-determination. The aim was to ensure that peace would not rest solely on the balance of power between the major powers but would take account of the interests of all member states and their citizens.   It is an objective which is far from being achieved, according to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.    “Today, a wind of madness is sweeping the globe. From Libya to Yemen to Syria and beyond – escalation is back. Arms are flowing. Offensives are increasing. […] Meanwhile, Security Council resolutions are being disrespected before the ink is even dry,” warned Guterres on February 4, 2020.   So, in terms of collective security, is the UN on the verge of becoming obsolete, as happened to the LoN at the end of the 1930s?  If the UN’s executive branch – the Security Council – is paralysed, other international bodies help pacify societies. The UN is based on three pillars:  peace and security, development and human rights. As pointed out by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan in 2005, these three areas are interdependent.   “There cannot be security without development nor development without security. And one and the other each depend on the respect of human rights and the state of law,” Annan said.    But for at least a decade, civil liberties have been eroded even at the heart of liberal democracies such as the US, but also in Europe.   At the same time, authoritarian regimes like China are taking advantage of western weaknesses to tout an alternative model of economic success that excludes complete respect for civil and political rights. The heart of modern democratic regimes, human rights, are being questioned even within the international bodies that are supposed to defend them. In Geneva, the UN Human Rights Council is the main focus of this battle which has global implications.   If confirmed, the backsliding of democracies could influence the way the world responds to the two major issues of the 21st century: the climate and environmental crisis, and the digital transition of the economy and of society.    The coronavirus SRAS-CoV-2 pandemic is the black swan of 2020 – the unpredictable event shaking the world. With the World Health Organization (WHO) on the frontline, the UN can demonstrate the importance of its role as a coordinator of international health and national policies.   The pandemic which surprised many states was extremely predictable. Following epidemics like Aids in the 1980s and SARS in 2002, WHO member states revised international health regulations in 2005 to assist countries to work together to contain such viruses.  However, as this international instrument has not been properly applied, coronavirus has spread worldwide. It remains to be seen whether the shock of Covid-19 and its multiple consequences will give the UN a new legitimacy or render it meaningless, like the League of Nations a century ago.   In relation to the climate, Guterres reiterates that there can only be collective solutions which engage all UN member states. Could this existential threat to humanity as a whole cause the international community to split, as happened in the wake of the two world wars last century?   At the same time, the world is engaged in an industrial revolution that is larger and more profound than those which took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. The digital transition is radically transforming the economic and financial world, as well as the functioning of societies and the democratic rights designed to govern them. The individual and collective rights contained in the UN Charter are therefore under serious threat.  The UN is attempting to regain control over this issue, notably from Geneva, by establishing legal norms to guide the digital transition so that it benefits everyone while respecting their fundamental rights.     This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-06;Swiss face shortage of ethanol for disinfectant after abandoning stockpile;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-face-shortage-of-ethanol-for-disinfectant-after-abandoning-stockpile/45670470;Switzerland risks a shortage of the raw material needed to make disinfectant to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reportedExternal link on Monday. The country abandoned its emergency reserve of 10,000 tonnes of ethanol two years ago. Switzerland keeps emergency stockpiles of everything from coffee, wheat and rice to cooking oil. But in 2018, the country ended its long-standing practice of stocking ethanol as part of efforts to privatise the country’s alcohol market, according to the German-language paper. The decision has contributed to shortages of disinfectant products such as hand sanitisers. They disappeared weeks ago from many store shelves as people stocked up – prompting distilleries, wineries and even beer brewers to begin making disinfectant. Some Swiss politicians are frustrated by what could have been an avoidable shortage.  “It just can’t be that an important raw material like alcohol is suddenly missing when a pandemic starts,” said Alois Gmür from the centrist Christian Democratic Party. Others said the issue must be addressed once the coronavirus crisis has subsided, with some members of the leftwing Social Democratic Party party saying Switzerland needed to invest in emergency reserves rather than the country’s planned CHF6 billion ($6.14 billion) purchase of new fighter jets. ​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-06;Recession is unavoidable, reckon Swiss finance bosses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_recession-is-unavoidable--reckon-swiss-finance-bosses/45670186;"The coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed the economic outlook for Switzerland within a very short period of time, with Swiss CFOs more pessimistic than ever before.  Neither during the euro crisis nor during the Swiss franc shock were chief financial officers as negative about economic prospects as they are today, according to the latest half-yearly surveyExternal link published on Monday by consultants Deloitte.   Although the surveys have been indicating a cooling off for almost two years, there has now been a real crash in confidence: 97% of the CFOs surveyed after mid-March expect the economy to develop negatively over the next 12 months – and 41% of them even foresee a strongly negative dynamic. In addition, two-thirds (67%) see a negative financial development for their company and only 15% see a positive one. Overall, 93% see their company’s future as less rosy than three months ago.  More than three-quarters (78%) expect a decline in sales, while more than half (52%) expect the number of employees to decline within a year.  However, the majority of Swiss CFOs are actively countering the crisis, the survey reported. For example, 91% of companies have taken measures to curb the weak growth; the most frequently cited measures were cost savings and revenue generation.  The really successful companies were already looking at the post-crisis period, said Alessandro Miolo, responsible for the CFO study at Deloitte.  “They are examining possible purchases or sales of parts of the company and implementing necessary internal changes in a targeted manner. I expect a major push in digitisation as a result of the [coronavirus] crisis,” says Miolo.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-06;Swiss lead way with crisis loans to small businesses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-lead-way-with-crisis-loans-to-small-businesses/45670144;It took Matthias Knauer only a minute or two to complete and scan the single-page form for a liquidity lifeline from the Swiss government. About 30 minutes after sending it, the money was in his company’s account. The comparison with his computer hardware support company’s UK subsidiary, based in the North Yorkshire town of Ilkley, could not be starker. Mr Knauer has 80 staff in Ilkley and is the town’s second-biggest employer.  After days of confusing phone calls to UK authorities, the company’s application for an emergency loan, part of a multibillion pound package of funding pledged by the government to support small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, was denied. The story has been the same for his other subsidiaries in Europe, he said: “The Brits are still trying to work out what to do, in Germany the system got completely overloaded and broke apart and the French are stuck in paperwork. “The backbone of all these economies are SMEs and they need money now. I don’t think politicians are aware of the magnitude of this.” Switzerland unveiled its CHF20 billion ($20billion) package of emergency loans to support small businesses on March 25. In its first week of operating, it disbursed more than CHF15 billion to 76,034 businesses. On Friday, Bern announced that it would double the facility to CHF40 billion. Its success is drawing attention elsewhere in Europe, with Swiss banks and the government in contact with European counterparts in recent days over how the scheme is structured.  In the UK, the Treasury is now considering a sweeping overhaul of its coronavirus lending scheme, barely a fortnight after it was launched. It has had 130,000 inquiries but by Thursday last week said it had granted only 983 loans. In Germany, Europe’s largest emergency loan scheme has had patchy success: communication has been poor, uptake low, and some companies report their banks telling them that money may take days, if not weeks, to arrive. In Italy, politicians last week spoke in parliament and urged their government to follow Switzerland’s model. Even Swiss people accustomed to the relative efficiency of their country have been surprised at the speed of its economic coronavirus counterattack.  “I’ve never experienced anything like it,” Alberto Belloli, head of Belloli, a family engineering business in the canton of Graubunden, told the Financial Times. “I applied on Friday afternoon and we had the money on Monday morning. It was a one-page form.” The money, when it arrived, meant that Mr Belloli could pay his staff and has time to put measures in place to protect his business.  “The co-operation between the banking system and federal government was brilliant,” he said. “Speed is everything here to secure jobs.”  Getting the correct support for smaller businesses will be the litmus test of how the world’s biggest economies are handling the economic fallout of Covid-19, say economists.  SMEs are at the frontline of the crisis, said Hans Gersbach, professor of macroeconomics at the Swiss federal institute of technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) and an adviser to the German ministry of economic affairs: “If [smaller business] cannot survive with sufficient health and with the possibility to invest in their businesses again the other side of this health crisis, then the economy will be in very great trouble.” The Swiss scheme has two elements. Under the first, businesses can apply for an immediate loan, worth up to 10% of their annual revenue, capped at CHF500,000. The loan is interest free and provided by Swiss banks, which are underwritten with a full credit guarantee on the amount by the Swiss government. A simple declaration is all that is needed.  The second facility lends up to CHF20 million, also provided by the banking system. Bern guarantees 85 per cent of the loan, charged at 0.5% interest. The bank assumes risk of the last 15 per cent, charged at a competitive rate.  Because it is run through the existing banking network and its customer relationships, the authorities were able to roll out the scheme almost overnight. Barely any new infrastructure was needed and banks already had the necessary credit history and data on their clients.  Switzerland’s small, clubbable world of business and political elites, often chided for its insularity, has been seen as a crucial factor in getting the programme rapidly off the ground. The plan started as an idea of Thomas Gottstein, the chief executive of Credit Suisse, as he watched the flow of negative economic data crossing his desk turn into a torrent. After phone conversations with finance minister Ueli Maurer in Bern, SNB chief Thomas Jordan and Mark Branson, head of market regulator Finma, a task force was set up to bring other banks on board. Four days later the plan was ready to go.  “The key thing was for the process to be conducted in a rapid and straightforward manner, so that the money is transferred to the company’s account as quickly as possible,” Mr Gottstein said. In total, 121 Swiss banks are participating. UBS is Switzerland’s largest lender to small enterprises and has become the biggest channel. “We covered more than 10,000 requests in the first two days,” said Axel Lehmann, president of UBS Switzerland.  UBS has delegated 300 extra employees to handle the programme, he said. It is also using 100 “robots” — algorithms that automatically scan and process applications — to process requests swiftly. But the success of the scheme addresses only one element of the economic challenge, experts warn. The harder task will be preventing a liquidity crisis evolving into an insolvency crisis, said Prof Gersbach. “That carries much more of a financial burden for governments and more risk,” he said. “What Switzerland has done [so far] has been efficient economically — it has done very well. But ultimately it still might only hold off insolvencies for a few weeks.”  Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020 This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-05;Swiss hospitals reportedly running out of money;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/under-pressure_swiss-hospitals-reportedly-running-out-of-money/45669458;Cash-strapped Swiss hospitals, in the front line of the fight against coronavirus, are calling for financial help and an end to the ban on non-emergency procedures which has sapped revenue, reports the SonntagsZeitung newspaper. It quotes the director of Valais Hospital Hugo Burgener as saying “we need liquidity to pay salaries”, and writes that the Graubünden cantonal hospital will also have to raise an additional CHF20 million ($20 million) in the next few days. Other clinics with empty coffers are reporting to the H+ Swiss HospitalsExternal link association, to which 220 Swiss hospitals are affiliated, according to the paper. The federal government’s ban on scheduled non-emergency procedures during the crisis has led to considerable losses in earnings, which in turn have an impact on liquidity, says H+ spokeswoman Dorit Djelid. We are clarifying with the Federal Office of Public Health whether a gradual relaxation can be envisaged, she told the paper, which says this is likely to depend on when the peak of the pandemic is reached. Revenue has also been lost because the ski resorts are closed and so no skiing accident victims are reporting to emergency wards. At the same time, hospital spending has risen sharply to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.  Intensive care units have had to increase the number of beds with ventilators, requiring new walls to be built and rooms adapted, while the cost of protective material has exploded. Cantons have started to support their hospitals with bridging loans, according to the paper. Meanwhile, the federal government, cantons and hospitals are discussing how the coronavirus services will be paid for.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Other addiction counselling centres agree, saying the pandemic represents this additional risk for people who are alone and addicted, writes the paper.  “When there is no social control, consumption is more easily considered as a way to solve one’s problems,” says Meury.  Sales of alcohol, tobacco and legal cannabis have risen since the beginning of the crisis, writes the SonntagsBlick. This is according to a survey carried out by the paper among producers and vendors. It points out, however, that it is difficult to know if increased volumes are being consumed or if they are just being hoarded, as seen with toilet paper.  Even more than these substances, experts are worried about increased addictions to the Internet during coronavirus confinement, such as online gambling, videos, pornography and shopping, writes the paper.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

In the western French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, an average one third of people who have died after catching the coronavirus were residents of nursing homes for the elderly (EMS), report Le Matin Dimanche and its sister newspaper Sonntagszeitung. However, not all cantons are affected in the same way. Residents of homes for the elderly account for almost half the victims in the cantons of Vaud (60 out of 123 deaths) and Neuchâtel (11 out of 23 deaths), while in Geneva they represent about a fifth of the deaths (19 out of 45). In the canton of Bern, this rate is around 10% (3 out of 28 deaths). More and more people are becoming infected in these homes, write the two newspapers. In the canton of Geneva, 22 out of 54 homes are already reporting infected residents. In Bern, 20 of the 67 residents and 9 employees of one nursing home alone have become infected. Because the sick and elderly are the most vulnerable, these homes are shut to the outside world to protect the residents, but once there is infection it spreads fast, writes Le Matin Dimanche. The confined residents find the situation very hard and often do not follow the rules, while staff often lack proper protective gear. Some staff have been trying to protect themselves with plastic bags and ski goggles, while masks are often re-used instead of being thrown away. Proper protective clothing is vital since nursing staff work in close contact with residents to wash, feed, move and care for them. Stocks of this gear now seem to be improving, Le Matin writes.

2020-04-05;Pressure growing for confinement exit strategy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_pressure-growing-for-confinement-exit-strategy/45669032;Pressure to gradually reopen the economy is increasing, but Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset has told a Sunday newspaper a rapid end to coronavirus restrictions is not realistic.  In an interview with the SonntagsZeitung, Berset warned that if public adherence to the restrictions over Easter fell, the government might even tighten them and impose a curfew.  He said the government would discuss on Wednesday scenarios for ending confinement but a decision was not yet expected. “It is only when the number of infected people and admissions to hospital are clearly falling that we will be able to consider softening the rules,” he told the paper.  However, there is growing pressure to gradually reopen the economy. In an interview with the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper, Petra Gössi, head of the centre-right Radical Liberal Party, calls for the reopening of all shops that can comply with government safety measures, i.e. two-metre distancing between all persons in the shop and all hygiene regulations. If we don't do this, we risk unnecessarily undermining public understanding of the government measures, she told the paper.  Faced with the devastating effects of the pandemic on employment, the heads of the Swiss employers' association Swissmem and the Swiss Trade Union Federation (USS) are both calling for the government to present exit scenarios, writes the SonntagsZeitung. The Federal Council must now develop a strategy in which economic and social risks also play a role, USS President Pierre-Yves Maillard told the paper.    And the Social Democrat Party is calling notably for a cap on health insurance premiums to relieve household budgets, its parliamentary group chairman Roger Nordmann told the SonntagsBlick newspaper.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-05;Greetings from my home office in the Swiss Alps;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/letter-from-the-alps_greetings-from-my-home-office-in-the-swiss-alps/45668888;There are certainly worse places to work from. I know I am very privileged in this regard, especially since the authorities have appealed to residents not to abandon towns and cities for the mountains. I have been compensating for the physical activity I usually get during my daily commute to Bern with a peaceful morning walk along the lakeshore and an early evening cycle in the mountain valleys behind my house. The temptation for many Swiss to enjoy the same benefits is very real, since a lot of them own chalets or apartments in the mountains that are within a relatively short drive or train journey from their urban homes. But the powers that be have warned against such travel for fear the coronavirus will spread to small alpine communities which lack the medical facilities to deal with an outbreak. The municipality of Onsernone in the southern canton of Ticino is one example. According to reports, nearly half of the population of about 700 souls is over 65 years of age. They are served by only one local doctor. Yet the population often swells at Easter and in summer because many of the houses in the picturesque valley are holiday residences owned by Swiss living just a few hours away by car. Wishing to avoid the worst, the municipality sent a letter in late March to all owners of second homes asking them to stay away, warning that the police would only allow access to those who needed to be there on urgent grounds. The announcement was also published about a week later in Zurich’s Tages-Anzeiger newspaperExternal link, since the Easter school break normally sees convoys of German-speaking families from north of the Alps head south to the warmer clime of Ticino. Communities like Onsernone have had to take matters into their own hands since the federal government has not banned travel between communities or cantons outright, only recommending that residents curtail their movements. Hotels and non-hotel accommodation have been allowed to stay open, which has sent mixed messages to the population at large.  But with restaurants, bars, and ski lifts closed, bookings have been rare. A survey carried out in late March by the tourism research institute of the HES-SO university of applied sciences found that hotels were forecasting a 90% loss in revenue for April and a 73% drop in May. Hotels, like most businesses, have been thrown a lifeline by the government. They can apply for bridging loans and credits to see them through the crisis. However, at the time of writing, it was unclear if financial aid would also be extended to so-called gig workers in the tourism sector, who have also been hit hard by the crisis. A self-employed tour guide contacted us, saying 90% of his bookings between February and July have been cancelled. And an owner of apartments advertised on Airbnb wrote to say he’s always done everything above board – declaring his income and making sure his clients pay the local tourist tax – but was worried he would not be eligible for assistance. Both wrote in after reading my story about Angela McMillan, an owner of a bed and breakfast in Leysin, a mountain resort in the Vaudoise Alps. I’m used to conducting such interviews in person, but I had to hook up with Angela by video. I asked her to walk her Macbook around the chalet to give me a virtual feel of her rental property. I captured screenshots as she went. She said the mood in the village was somber. Even communication with other locals was largely taking place over Facebook and online messaging services. If you’d like to read about Angela’s situation, and likely thousands of others like her, here’s the link to the storyExternal link. The upcoming Easter weekend normally heralds the end of the Swiss ski season, but the coronavirus shut it down a month early this year, leaving skiers with only nostalgia for glorious spring skiing of years past. If you missed our photo gallery from early March highlighting what it was like in the Swiss Alps in skiing’s heyday, here’s another chanceExternal link.

2020-04-04;Too early to relax coronavirus measures, says top health official;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_too-early-to-relax-coronavirus-measures--says-top-health-official/45667926;The peak of coronavirus infections has not yet been reached in Switzerland and it is far too early to relax restrictions, says top public health official Daniel Koch. Meanwhile nearly a quarter of the population is on short time work. Koch, who is head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), reminded people at a press conference on Saturday that the government measures were aimed at flattening the curve of infections and protecting vulnerable groups, notably people over 65 and/ or with existing health problems. These are the people who put a strain on our hospitals and the health system and who have to fear for their lives, said Koch. He stressed that it is “everyone’s responsibility” to protect the vulnerable”, urging people to “stay home” this weekend and only go out “alone for a short walk” or exercise in the garden. The number of Covid-19 infections detected in Switzerland has now climbed to some 20,000, while the number of deaths is over 600. The number of people under artificial respiration on Saturday was 435, according to Koch. He said the age range of the deceased was 32 to 101 years, and the average age was 83. Only 6 percent of them were under 65 years old. 97 percent of the dead had suffered from at least one previous illness, with the three most frequently mentioned being high blood pressure (69 percent), cardiovascular diseases (55 percent) and diabetes (29 percent). The total number of coronavirus tests carried out to date is around 153,440, of which the result was positive in 15 percent of cases, according to the FOPH. Almost a quarter of the Swiss working population (1.3 million people) is on short-time work, Director of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch told the press conference on Saturday. In the southern canton of Ticino, where around 8,000 applications for short-time work are submitted every week, the rate is as high as 40%, she said. Despite government measures including CHF60 billion in economic aid, she reiterated that the Swiss economy will not emerge from the crisis without damage. For the authorities, the important thing for the time being is to ensure the salaries of employees and to avoid business bankruptcies. It is very difficult to say today how and when the recovery will take place, she admitted. The authorities are preparing for a way out of the crisis, with SECO and the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) studying various scenarios.  SECO is monitoring the situation closely, she said, citing the example of a teleconference she had this week with the tourism sector. We will maintain regular contacts, so that we can best prepare what will be necessary when the time comes, Ineichen-Fleisch told the press conference. Army and civil protection deployed About 5,000 civil protection personnel are currently mobilized in the fight against the coronavirus, said Christoph FluryExternal link, Deputy Director of the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS). Of these, 2900 are deployed in French-speaking Switzerland. The western canton of Vaud, one of the worst affected by the epidemic, has been allocated 1,200 civil protection personnel, while another 200 were sent to Geneva over the weekend. However, he said these figures could vary greatly from week to week. Their main mission is support to hospitals, but also increasingly hospices and old people’s homes, Flury told the press conference. There they relieve the medical staff in routine and disinfection work. They are also supporting the law enforcement agencies to ensure that the population complies with federal measures such as social distancing. These civilian service militia have been deployed alongside the army. Brigadier Raynald Droz, Chief of Staff of the DDPS Operations Command said that on Saturday, the 20th day of the army's engagement, 4,900 soldiers are mobilised, including 4,000 medical personnel. One thousand army medical personnel could still be called up if necessary, he told the press conference. On March 16, the Swiss government announced that it was mobilising up to 8,000 members of the military to help the cantons fight the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Covid-19.  This radical measure, taken during what is described as an exceptional emergency, is the largest military mobilisation in Switzerland since the Second World War.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-04;Giacometti’s lost works reappear at Paris show ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sculpture--_giacometti-s-lost-works-reappear-at-paris-show-/45665112;"Famed Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti destroyed many of his own works and lost countless others. Using photos of his mythical Parisian studio, his namesake institute has reconstructed some of these forgotten and little-known sculptures.  The room where Giacometti set up home with his brother Diego in 1926 is miniscule. A mere 24m2 on the ground floor of a house on rue Hippolyte-Maindron in Paris, it had no toilet or running water. Water had had to be fetched from outside. Alberto slept on a small bed at the back of the room, while the younger Diego made do with the mezzanine.  In 1948, Swiss photographer Ernst Scheidegger paid the artist a visit.  “Alberto’s cramped and crowded studio […] where he had been working for 20 years, had no comforts, but every object, every inch of wall space carried signs of his work,” Scheidegger wrote in his book, Traces of a Friendship. “If Alberto was away […] he was usually in one of two cafés located at the intersection of Rue Didot and Rue d’Alésia, where bank branches stand today. There he would eat hard-boiled eggs and ham and read the newspapers.”  The studio disappeared after Giacometti’s death in 1966. But in 2018 the Giacometti InstituteExternal link in Paris recreated it in the same neighbourhood in Montparnasse.  Visitors can picture the artist going from one creation to another, reading the Gazette littéraire on his mattress, smoking, sketching a face on the walls, then working some more.  But where to store all these works? There simply wasn’t enough space. So Giacometti “sometimes moved, threw away or destroyed older works to make room for new ones,  says Christian Alandete, artistic director of the Giacometti Institute. The artist stored pieces at friends' houses, in galleries and sometimes would forget to retrieve them.  “Distrutto” and “perduto” are words that appear in his journals. Was the genius artist Giacometti a lousy curator, incorrigibly absent-minded, or someone who was never satisfied – someone for whom the work was never finished?    In truth, the Swiss was not against documenting the body of his work, since he invited photographers, including Man Ray, to immortalize his studio.  It is thanks to these photos that today curators can take stock of Giacometti’s lost works. One image taken by Man Ray at a surrealism exhibition in 1933 shows a woman whose upper body is a violin. This work is now lost. At the time Giacometti was still largely unknown; the magazine Vu had just published an image of “The Bird Silence”  with a bird flapping its wings inside a cage. This creation, like so many others that were documented in photographs or the artist’s journals, has also disappeared.  Intrigued by the mystery of these lost creations, the Giacometti Foundation, caretaker of the artist’s works, began looking into disappeared works dated 1920-1935.   “Back then, Giacometti was more interested in artistic research than in preserving his work,” says Alandete. The artist kept journals and even drew up a list of his works for his first major exhibition in New York.   But this inventory is “riddled with errors”, says Michèle Kieffer, curator of the show “In search of lost works”.  In short, Giacometti was a genius but also a “negligent archivist”, as the newspaper Le Monde puts it. The artist lost track of some of his creations. He destroyed many others, before reconstructing them. Some works were also damaged, like his “Composition” in clay from 1927.   “His financial difficulties may have prevented him from always seeking out a moulder” to make a plaster version, says Kieffer. And clay is highly breakable.  The sculptor was not afraid to throw out damaged pieces, like the piece titled “Little Man”, which was inspired by African art and was pictured with its creator in a photo from the 1920s.   “Broken and destroyed long ago, and I regret it, I think sometimes of redoing it – it was my first piece,” he wrote later in a letter to gallery owner Pierre Matisse.  Did Giacometti’s rise to fame in the 1930s inspire jealousy or destructive fury? In 1932 the artist together with the filmmaker Luis Bunuel created a life-sized giraffe that featured hidden erotic texts. The two surrealist artists placed it on the grounds of the villa of patrons Marie-Laure and Charles de Noailles in Hyères, in the south of France, before heading out for dinner.   “After we’d had our coffee, I came back to the garden with Giacometti,” Bunuel wrote in his memoirs. “No giraffe. It was gone, without explanation.”  “Was it deemed too scandalous after the scandal of the Golden Age?” wondered Bunuel, referring to his first feature-length film.  For fans of the famous creator of “The Walking Man”, regret and mystery abound. The photographs and scribbles in Giacometti’s journals give them an idea of what works have been lost. But the Giacometti Institute wanted to go further by reconstructing some of the sculptures in three dimensions. In this way “The Mannequin”, shot by Man Ray, and “The Bird Silence” come to life, unsigned – of course – by the artist.  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the show “In search of lost works” at the Giacometti Institute in Paris has been closed until further notice.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-04;Coronavirus is a nightmare for domestic violence victims;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/abuse_coronavirus-is-a-nightmare-for-domestic-violence-victims/45666140;What happens when the doors to the house are locked? If the hope of stopping the Covid-19 pandemic lies in the confinement of populations, isolation also leaves more leeway for violent spouses. Swiss victim support organisations are concerned.     Stay home! The most important measure to combat the Covid-19 pandemic is being broadcast everywhere, in Switzerland as in many other countries. This injunction presupposes that the home is a safe and cosy place. But many people, especially women experience domestic violence, turning confinement into a nightmare.  We are in a contradictory situation: people are told to stay at home, but for victims of domestic violence staying at home is more dangerous than going out, says Myriame Zufferey, director of Solidarité Femmes for the Biel region. Since the government imposed restrictions on people’s movement to stem the spread of coronavirus, the phone of this help service for women victims of violence has been ringing less frequently.  What could be interpreted as a good sign is unfortunately not, according to its director. We believe that women confined with their aggressor no longer find the space to call for help, she says. In order to contact support services, which remain open, victims must be able to escape the control of their violent spouse.  It is feared that situations are likely to escalate because of confinement. Quarantine is a challenge for all families. It increases pressure on family systems and can increase dysfunction, says Zuffrey. In addition, the coronavirus crisis puts some families in a fragile financial situation, which further increases stress and the risk of conflict.  To avoid the worst, the key is daring to ask for help in time. Zuffrey calls on everyone to take responsibility. People likely to become violent can also seek help, especially from organisations that work with abusers, she says. Generally speaking, when things get too much, she advises people to go out and exercise or get some fresh air.  At national level, the figures do not yet show an increase in domestic violence. However, while calls in Biel have so far decreased, other victim support organisations are already reporting an increase. This is the case at the counselling centre co-run by Pia Alleman in Zurich. Anyone can be affected. However, the danger is greater for families with many children, who live in a small apartment and whose parents do not have a stable employment situation, she said in an interview with the news website WatsonExternal link.  Aware of the problem, the Swiss government has set up a task force headed by the Federal Office for Gender Equality (FOGE). The task force is responsible for regularly assessing the situation and considering measures that should be taken in the event of an increase in domestic violence. In a press releaseExternal link, it points out that the cantonal centres specializing in victim assistance are operational. Lessons learned from the coronavirus lockdown in China, which has now ended, are not encouraging on the domestic violence front. The quarantine only aggravated the problem, as an article in the Tribune de GenèveExternal link notes. In the Chinese press, testimonies of battered, abused or kidnapped women abound, the newspaper wrote. ItalyExternal link, where all citizens are subject to strict confinement, is also seeing an increase in violence within the home. Isolation can sometimes bring out the worst in a human being.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-03;Stay-at-home Swiss abide by coronavirus measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_stay-at-home-swiss-abide-by-coronavirus-measures/45666634;Visits to Swiss restaurants, shopping centres or museums plummeted by 81% in March, according to location data from users’ phones collected by Google.  Google’s analysis of billions of phones in 131 countries is the largest public dataset available to help health authorities assess whether people are obeying shelter-in-place and similar orders issued across the world to rein in the spread of Covid-19.   Its reports show charts that compare traffic from February 16 to March 29. These are broken down into segments such as restaurants, shopping centres and museums, retailers and chemists, parks, train stations, and workplaces and residential areas.  In Switzerland, in addition to visits in the restaurant, retail and leisure sectors, activity declined in all areas except residential areas. The food stores and chemists that were still open were 51% less frequented.  There were 41% fewer people strolling along rivers and in parks, 68% fewer on public transport and 46% fewer at work. On the other hand, 15% more people stayed at home. After March 16, when the government announced its emergency measures, the numbers in restaurants sank abruptly.  At the same time, the frequency of visits to food stores and chemists increased as people started stocking up. This curve later flattened out. In parks and public spaces, the number of visitors initially increased right after March 16.  Elsewhere, in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus, visits to retail and recreation locations, including restaurants and cinemas, plunged by 94% while visits to workplaces slid 63%. Reflecting the severity of the crisis there, grocery and pharmacy visits in Italy dropped 85% and park visits were down by 90%.  The data also underscore some challenges authorities have faced in keeping people apart. Food store visits surged in Singapore, Britain and elsewhere as travel restrictions were set to go into place. Visits to parks spiked in March in some San Francisco Bay Area counties, forcing them to later put the sites off limits.  By contrast in Japan, where authorities have been relatively relaxed in urging social distancing measures but where calls have been growing daily for a state of emergency, visits to retail and recreational places fell 26%. Visits to people’s workplaces dropped a mere 9%.  Data in Google’s reports came from users who enabled Google’s “Location History” feature on their devices. The company said it adopted technical measures to ensure that no individual could be identified through the new reports.

2020-04-03;Swiss government doubles company bailout fund to CHF40bn ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-fallout_swiss-set-to-double-company-bailout-fund-to-chf40bn-/45665824;The government has decided to double the amount of emergency loans available to struggling companies to CHF40 billion ($41 billion). The current fund of CHF20 billion is expected to be used up “in the next few days”. There is still a demand from companies for loans and the number of requests keeps rising, said Finance Minister Ueli Maurer at a news conference on Friday. The first CHF10 billion was being requested “as a matter of urgency”, he said. A parliamentary committee, due to meet next week, has therefore been asked to approve a significant increase in the amount of funds needed to prop up the economy during the coronavirus crisis.  This would raise the total amount of state funding to around CHF62 billion, with other tranches of money set aside to cover the wages of workers who have been put on short-time hours and other targeted measures. More than 75,000 credit agreements have already been approved to provide mainly small and medium-sized companies with some CHF14.3 billion in emergency cash to cover their immediate bills.  State-backed loans of up to CHF500,000 are interest free, while a rate of 0.5% is applied to larger credits of up to CHF20 million. Loans are limited to 10% of company revenues and are to be paid back within five years. Maurer said it was a mistake to assume that the state would provide coverage for every eventuality. For the moment the loans seem to be the adequate response. We're assessing the situation permanently and it's possible that we may adjust our policy, he said. The bridging loan scheme was introduced on March 26 after the government ordered non-essential shops and services to close their doors. Cantons were later given permission to shutter certain manufacturing activities to prevent the spread of the pandemic. While stating that the government is “assuming that the aid credits are not being abused”, Maurer said it wanted to tighten rules and procedures to prevent fraud. It's under control and we don't think there are massive attempts to abuse the system, he said.  The government wants to set up a central unit to weed out unwarranted or duplicate loan applications. Tax records will be analysed to make sure that companies are not inflating their sales figures to get larger loans than they are allowed, according to a government statementExternal link. The finance ministry is also looking into ways to beef up criminal sanctions to prosecute not just fraudulent firms but also company directors.

2020-04-03;‘Anti-malaria drug can kill coronavirus’: Novartis chief;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/quest-for-cure_-anti-malaria-drug-can-kill-coronavirus---novartis-chief/45653476;Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis believes the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine offers one of the best hopes to combat coronavirus and has donated 130 million doses as part of the pandemic response. “Pre-clinical studies in animals as well as the first data from clinical studies show that hydroxychloroquine kills the coronavirus,” Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan told the SonntagsZeitung newspaperExternal link on March 29. On April 3, Novartis said it was donating a considerable amount of the drug to the Swiss authorities, which would organise distribution to hospitals. Switzerland is thus the first European country – and second country in the world after the US – to receive some doses. Hydroxychloroquine, produced by Novartis’s Sandoz division among other companies, is also used to treat lupus and arthritis. “We are working with Swiss hospitals on possible treatment protocols for the clinical use of this drug [against Covid-19], but it is too early to say anything definitive,” added Narasimhan. Hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of Covid-19.  Novartis had previously issued a pledgeExternal link to give away 130 million doses of the drug, including 50 million 200 gram doses it already has stockpiled. It has been reported that the United States has accepted 30 million doses. “Novartis will work with stakeholders including the World Health Organization to determine the best distribution of the medicine to ensure broad access to patients most in need of this medicine globally,” the company stated on March 20. Other Novartis drugs are also being explored as possible treatment for Covid-19 including the multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya and the cancer drug Jakavi, Narasimhan told the paper. Other pharmaceutical firms are also working on bringing potential coronavirus medicines to patients. Among them is Roche, which has launched a clinical trial of a potential new Covid-19 drug Actemra. The Swiss drugmaker said on March 20 it was working with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US government to initiate a phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety of the drug used to treat cytokine release syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, two inflammatory diseases.

On March 23, he called for an immediate global ceasefire to protect vulnerable civilians in conflict zones from the ravages of the pandemic. However, nations have largely disregarded his appeal.  The Security Council has twice previously addressed public health emergencies, first the HIV/AIDS pandemic and second the swiftly spreading Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, which it called a threat to international peace and security. However, this time the council has been conspicuously silent since the start of the pandemic, as the five permanent members (the US, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and France) are divided on reaching a resolution to support Guterres' appeal for international action.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-03;Tour de Suisse is cancelled for 2020;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-and-sports_tour-de-suisse-is-cancelled-for-2020/45665366;The Tour de Suisse will not take place this year. The organisers of the cycling race around Switzerland say the coronavirus pandemic has left them with little choice. The 84th edition of the Tour de SuisseExternal link should have started on June 7, with an individual time trial in Frauenfeld, northeastern Switzerland. One week later, the competition, which belongs to the World TourExternal link, would have ended in mountainous Andermatt and the Furka, Grimsel and Susten passes.  It is the first time in the 87-year history of the Tour de Suisse that it has had to be cancelled in peacetime. Only the events scheduled for 1940, 1943, 1944 and 1945 could not be held owing to the Second World War.  The organisers said that although the event had not been banned by the federal authorities they had decided not to postpone the tour until later in the racing calendar as this was not logistically and financially feasible.  “It was with a heavy heart that we have made this decision due to the corona pandemic. We are however convinced that it is the best solution to provide certainty and thus planning security for participants, fans and partners. For the Tour de Suisse, it is also an important step to ensure the continuation of this event in the future,” Olivier Senn, co-managing director of the Tour de Suisse organisation, said in a statement on Friday.   The aim is to hold the event in June 2021, although exact dates have not been fixed.  The Tour de Suisse is just one of many sporting events to have been cancelled or postponed around the world, including the Ice Hockey World Championship in Switzerland, the Summer Olympic Games, Euro 2020, Formula One races, the French Open and Wimbledon.

2020-04-03;Laid-off workers urged to help harvest crops;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/seasonal-shortage_laid-off-workers-urged-to-help-harvest-crops/45665220;Swiss farmers are asking people who have been temporarily laid off work in their normal jobs to help bring in the spring harvest. The usual supply of seasonal workers from abroad has dried up because of coronavirus lockdowns and border restrictions. Without replacement workers, seasonal crops such as asparagus could go to waste, farmers are warning. Their plea has been echoed by Economics Minister Guy Parmelin. “I call on anyone looking for work to go to the fields to help farmers. Spring vegetables must be harvested and it is difficult to get seasonal workers from abroad entry [into Switzerland],” he told Schweizer Illustrierte magazineExternal link. Thomas Wyssa, a spokesman for vegetable farmers in northwestern Switzerland, told Swiss public broadcaster, SRFExternal link, that hotel or catering staff who have been told to stay at home during the pandemic by their employers could come to work in the fields. “This is a precarious situation that will be difficult to solve in such a short space of available time,” he said. ‘People want to help’ Temporary workers from countries including Portugal, Spain, Poland and Romania are usually relied upon to plant the next batch of crops for harvesting later in the year. Mathias Grünig from the Bernese Farmers Association said laid-off Swiss workers were starting to respond to appeals for help from the agricultural industry. “This has never happened before and it shows that people want to help,” he told SRF. However, he warned that the work could often be strenuous and open to the elements while wages were not high. Parmelin said that there were other ways Swiss people could help farmers. “I appeal to consumers to drink Swiss wine and eat Swiss products.” The Swiss farmers association has created a websiteExternal link with information about open positions in the agriculture sector during the coronavirus pandemic.

2020-04-02;B&B chalet has room with alpine view, but no takers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/gig-economy_b-b-chalet-has-room-with-alpine-view--but-no-takers/45662254;Angela McMillan would love to have guests in her chalet in the mountain resort of Leysin. Her bed and breakfast is open for business, yet bookings have dried up due to the coronavirus lockdown. “We are really worried. For a lot of owners of holiday flats and B&Bs, this will be the end,” McMillan says, during a video call with swissinfo.ch. McMillan, an expat from the United Kingdom who has lived in Switzerland on and off for the past four decades, opened her B&B three years ago. She lives from the income generated from renting out three roomsExternal link in her rustic chalet. She contacted swissinfo.ch earlier this week to raise awareness of her plight, and – she thinks – that of thousands of others like her, who are not eligible for loans or credit promised by the Swiss government to soften the blow from the health crisis: “In a very short time, I will not be able to pay my bills or cover my expenses,” she wrote. McMillan is self-employed and says she declares and pays taxes on her small business’s income, yet she is not officially registered as an independent. According to the Swiss Social Insurance OfficeExternal link, this disqualifies her for financial assistance. It is difficult to know how many people like her contribute to the shadow tourist economy. The Federal Statistical OfficeExternal link counts 31,000 holiday apartments across the country, while Airbnb lists more than 35,000 houses, flats and rooms for Switzerland. Because the owners of vacation rentals often advertise their properties across multiple booking platforms, it is impossible to know the exact number. Nor is it known how many are registered businesses or – if they’re not listed – whether the owners are officially self-employed. Vacation rentals, whether entire houses, flats, or rooms, have become a popular alternative to traditional hotels thanks to the ease of booking or renting out rooms through Airbnb, booking.com and their competitors. McMillan says visitors often prefer chalets like hers to large hotels because they offer a more homely setting.  Her claim is supported by official statistics. For every five nights tourists or business travellers spend in Switzerland, one is in non-hotel accommodation. The figure is likely much higher, since the statistical office data only includes registered properties. At the moment however, McMillan is at a disadvantage, since she cannot apply for assistance to help her pay her bills or for regular maintenance and repairs, unlike hotels that are eligible for bridging loans to cover shortfalls in liquidity. “I have to keep smiling, but it’s difficult,” she says. “The government doesn’t talk about us, but there are a lot of us.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-02;Should all Swiss be wearing face masks?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_should-all-swiss-be-wearing-face-masks-/45663098;"“No,” say the Swiss government and the World Health Organization (WHO); “yes,” say some European governments and some Swiss politicians; “yes and no,” say many opinionated swissinfo.ch readers.  Since April 1, shoppers entering supermarkets in neighbouring Austria have been given a face mask which they must wear; the plan is to extend the measure to all food shops and chemists of a certain size by April 6. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia it’s compulsory to wear one anywhere in public, and in many parts of East Asia almost everyone wears a mask by default.  Although Switzerland has one of the highest number of coronavirus cases per million inhabitants in Europe, the Swiss authorities don’t think much of this.  “It hasn’t been proven that distributing masks to the public protects people,” said Daniel Koch, head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), at a press conference on March 17.  Koch has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the widespread wearing of protective masks in the population. In an interviewExternal link with Swiss public television, SRF, on March 27 he said that wearing a mask could even give people a false sense of security.  “It’s clear that, wearing a mask, you feel you are better protected. And that probably results in some people paying less attention to other precautionary measures – they wash their hands less, touch their mask and face more, don’t keep their distance,” he said.  Not everyone is happy with this. On March 22, the labour union Unia led a protestExternal link outside a Geneva branch of Migros, one of Switzerland’s largest supermarket chains, highlighting the unease of many employees who said they had been prevented by Migros from wearing masks or gloves.  “These are the measures recommended by the Federal Office of Public Health,” Migros spokesman Tristan Cerf told Swiss public televisionExternal link, RTS. “It may appear surprising not to have masks or gloves, but those measures aren’t effective.”  Koch’s comments do indeed reflect the official Swiss positionExternal link: surgical or respirator masks should be worn only by people examining or caring for people who have tested positive for Covid-19, who have symptoms or who are in a risk group.  The FOPH explicitly saysExternal link that “healthy people should not wear hygiene masks (surgical masks) in public. If you are in good health, they do not protect you effectively from infection with respiratory viruses”.  This echoes the position of the WHOExternal link, which stresses that “if you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill, then you are wasting a mask”. It provides further advice on when and how to use masksExternal link.  However, several Swiss politicians across the political spectrum think the government has got it wrong.  “If there were enough masks, it would make sense to make it temporarily obligatory to wear a mask – for example when going shopping or using public transport,” said Bastien Girod from the left-wing Green Party.  Girod accuses the FOPH of not being transparent enough in its communication. “Since masks are in short supply, the health office is informing people strategically. If masks didn’t help, hospital staff wouldn’t use them.”  Verena Herzog from the right-wing Swiss People’s Party said it was “incomprehensible” that the health office repeatedly questioned the effectiveness of hygiene masks.  “This is a pure white lie because the compulsory stockpiles are not filled,” she said. “Hygiene masks hold back viruses and are logically a huge help, even if there’s no 100% protection,” she said.  The FOPH itself explainsExternal link that one of the means of transmission of the novel coronavirus is droplet infection. “If one person sneezes or coughs, the virus can be transported directly to the mucous membranes in the nose, mouth or eyes of other people.”  Koch himself has admitted that the government doesn’t have enough masks to impose a Slovakia-style compulsory wearing of masks, but he insists that Switzerland has enough for professional health workers. “The government has about 17 million and more are always being bought,” he told SRF. “But we currently need about two million a day.”  Andreas Glarner from the People’s Party said he was aware that wearing a mask was not reliable protection against Covid-19, “but if everyone who is possibly infected had had to wear a mask from the beginning, we surely could have prevented some infections”. He said that if there had been enough masks, this would have been the government strategy.  Many – but certainly not all – swissinfo.ch readers agree with Glarner. “Simply foolish and bad management not to enforce the wearing of masks in these times of high risk, it would slow down the infection rate greatly,” said RR.  Wearing a mask “is no more than some sort of attempt at virtue signalling. If you are already infected and are wearing it to protect others, then you should be in isolation. Masks are designed to protect others from your germs and not vice versa”, reckoned Suze.  “Regards shortage of masks, let’s be clear. This is due to the lack of anticipation and prevention of the governmental authorities. People who wear them are just reasonable and socially responsible,” said Common Sense.  “It’s pretty selfish for healthy people to be taking them away from people who actually need them,” countered Sam.  “Mr Koch knows [wearing a mask] works but does not admit it while we have not enough masks to go around, and therefore we are being lied to as to why they do not help,” concluded Huttuman.  What do you think?

In this second collection of answers to readers’ questions, we explore whether there is such a thing as an optimal testing rate. Testing has become one of the most hotly debated topics of the pandemic. Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for comprehensive testingExternal link, not all countries have deployed tests on a large scale.  Switzerland has gradually ramped up its rate of testing since the first cases of coronavirus were announced. But it continues to prioritise the most vulnerable and those in need of hospitalization. This approach has prompted many questions from swissinfo.ch readers about who can and cannot get tested. Some experts in the country have also questioned the targeted strategy of public health officials. A number of leading epidemiologists, led by Marcel Salathé from the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, are urging the Swiss government to do more testing.  “It is incredibly difficult to manage a crisis without knowing the extent of the problem,” Salathé and his colleagues wrote in a recent articleExternal link. Switzerland’s testing approach has evolved over the last two months, as the pandemic has spread and domestic cases have begun emerging.  In early March, the federal government said that some 2,500 tests were being carried out per day. By March 22, around 7,000 tests per day were being conducted throughout the country. Switzerland’s head of infectious diseases, Daniel Koch, announced in a press conference on Wednesday that 16,000 tests were conducted the day before. By April 1, Switzerland had done a total of 130,700 testsExternal link, or over 15,000 tests per million inhabitants. This makes the country, according to the Financial TimesExternal link, among those that test the most per capita.   Some cantons have taken the initiative to offer more tests by creating mobile testing and drive-through testing centres. Cantonal authorities in BernExternal link, in partnership with the Swiss Red Cross, set up a drive-through testing centre on April 2 following delays in acquiring equipment. The pilot testing centre can do about 200-300 tests a day. In canton Lucerne, a drive-through testing facility that welcomes patients from at-risk groups referred by their doctors has performed around 20 tests a dayExternal link, even though the capacity is to complete 50 tests a day, according to public broadcaster RTS.  In short, the authorities are discouraging people with mild symptoms from getting tested. The public health officeExternal link continues to tell anyone with Covid-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, to stay at home. Those who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill or seeing their symptoms worsen should call their doctor, who will then decide whether a medical examination is necessary. Anyone who has come into contact with an infected person should also quarantine themselves. As swissinfo.ch has previously reported, people with mild symptoms have been refused tests because they are not considered high risk. There are some indications that the government may start testing a larger swath of the population. During a press conference on April 1, Koch stated that the public health office is looking at expanding the criteria for testing and will evaluate whether doing so makes sense. The new testing facility in Bern announced on April 2 is the first centre to offer testing without a doctor referral. People are asked to fill out an online questionnaireExternal link to determine if they should get tested based on their risk profile. In a move deemed sensible by federal health authorities, Canton Zurich announced on April 2 that it will start testing any newly admitted patients to hospitals even if they don't display any Covid-19 symptoms in order to protect healthcare workers. There are several reasons why public health authorities have chosen not to do comprehensive testing in Switzerland. The first is to reserve healthcare resources for the people who really need them. This includes those 65 and over as well as those with underlying medical conditions.  Another reason is that there have been shortages of personnel, protection equipment, and testing materialExternal link, such as reagents and swabs.  Severin Schwan, CEO of Basel-based Roche, which has developed one of the first commercial coronavirus tests, said at the end of March that demand far outstrips supply and that testing should be targeted at high-risk patients, because “broad-based testing at this stage is not feasible.” Roche and many other diagnostic test makers have ramped up production to meet demand.  The situation appears to have improved. During Wednesday’s press conference, Koch announced that there “is no longer a test bottleneck.” A day later, he indicated however that there remain problems in the supply of materials at an international level. The government argued early last month that the virus had reached the point that it wasn’t possible to catch every case. This has attracted criticism from experts, including Salathé and his colleagues, who say that slowing the spread requires “a liberal strategy of testing, contact tracing and subsequent self-isolation” of those who test positive. Without widespread testing, it is difficult to get an accurate picture of how pervasive the virus is in the population and how well measures to limit its spread are working. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said earlier this weekExternal link that we would certainly like to see countries testing at the level of ten negative tests to one positive, as a general benchmark of a system that's doing enough testing to pick up all cases . He added that if most of the cases are positive then countries aren’t testing enough. In countries that have extensive testingExternal link, fewer than 12% of their tests are positive. On April 1, 15% of Switzerland’s test results were positive. Salathé and his colleagues argue that “to bend the epidemic curve downwards, we must prevent 50−70% of possible transmissions.” The epidemiologists add that “while strict social distancing measures are necessary, nobody can imagine such measures being enforceable for extended periods of time.” By testing, health authorities can identify infected members of the population, which then allows contact tracing and self-isolation to take place. But testing the whole population and more frequently may not be realistic, given resource constraints. Guido Cozzi, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen, suggests using instead a representative sample to help develop a more accurate trajectory of the pandemic. “At the moment official data on Covid-19 is plagued with selection bias,” Cozzi told swissinfo.ch. “The average recovery rate is not estimated accurately if we only test the people with serious symptoms.”  For example, is the mortality rate in South Korea lower when compared to the United Kingdom because more testing is being done in the former, which reveals more cases? He argues that developing an accurate trajectory of the infection rate requires repeatedly testing representative samples of the total population, including the non-infected. He suggests that a carefully constructed sample of 3,000 people who have been tested would provide reliable information on the situation in Switzerland. The idea is also being promoted by some European economistsExternal link. While representative samples may not give the full picture of a country’s infection rate, Cozzi says that they are cheaper than testing the entire population and can be repeated easily. Another way to get a clearer sense of the outbreak without having to test large numbers of people is by collecting data from the infected and the non-infected.  One such project is the Covid-19 trackerExternal link, set up by a group of researchers and software developers, together with the health department of canton Bern. Thanks to an online questionnaire, which more than 160,000 people have filled out so far, the tracker is gathering information to help identify regions with a high number of potential cases, so authorities can respond with targeted measures. Swiss scientists are also participating in a pan-European digital platform that uses data from smartphone apps to pinpoint people who are at risk of infection and connect them with local health services. A number of Swiss university hospitals – in Zurich, Lausanne, Geneva and St Gallen – are preparing to carry out serological tests to detect the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in the blood.This would help to provide an estimate of the proportion of the population that has developed even partial immunity to the virus.  Our objective is to have an assessment of the proportion of people potentially resistant to a new infection to inform the health and political authorities about the next steps, Dr. Silvia Stringhini, head of population epidemiology at the Geneva University Hospital, told RTS.

On Thursday, the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Education Ministers adopted common principlesExternal link and measures to help harmonise solutions at a national level for education in primary and secondary school levels as well as teacher training. Cantons are usually responsible for educational matters in Switzerland which is why the nationwide closure of all schools by the government until at least April 19 was so unprecedented. + Read more about why the government changed its mind on school closures here Schools have been adapting to the nationwide closure, which is now in its third week, with a variety of tools including online instruction. The cantonal education ministers agreed that the 2019/2020 school year would be accepted despite lessons being carried remotely due to school closures. The schoolyear will not be extended and school calendars in each canton will remain valid. In addition, vacations will not be used for teaching.  Report cards will be issued by schools and include mention that there was no classroom teaching during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The measures also guarantee that all upper secondary students who pass their courses will be allowed to pursue further studies or a job placement this autumn. Students in their final year of general or vocational schooling will also receive their diploma provided they pass their courses. A decision on how the diplomas will be issued is expected in May. By the end of April, addition information will be provided on the pupils making the transition from primary to secondary and secondary to upper secondary school. An announcement on the future of school closures is expected by the government before Easter, reports say.External link This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-02;Swiss want to work from home more frequently after pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-impact_swiss-want-to-work-from-home-more-frequently-after-pandemic/45662434;Four out of five Swiss residents say they would like to work from home more regularly after the coronavirus pandemic is over, according to a survey.  In response to the pandemic, most countries have put in place restrictions on citizens' movements, as well as closed schools and certain businesses, forcing many people around the world to work from home. Many companies have also established work from home policies to limit the spread of the virus. This mass experiment in remote working has been a huge challenge and a strain on resources, human and technological, often causing many parents to simultaneously work from home and look after their children. Despite the challenges, a survey of 1,000 Swiss residents carried out by Colombus ConsultingExternal link published this week found that the majority of people questioned had so far found homeworking a positive experience.  Around 70% said remote working was an effective option and 65% said the Swiss education system was well prepared for distance learning or that it would adapt sufficiently. Working at home was just one aspect of the consulting firm’s Confidence Index opinion poll, which also looked at the impact of Covid-19 on consumer purchasing and investment, as well as individual perception of the crisis on their future. Around 43% of people said they remained confident despite the current wave of infections and deaths reported in Switzerland. Despite the high confidence levels, nearly half (44%) of the respondents said they planned to cancel all or part of their expenses or investments originally planned before the crisis, especially for luxury goods, leisure activities, personal vehicles and financial investments. The poll found that just over one-third (35%) of Swiss were ready to change their purchasing habits, notably more willing to buy locally, or via smaller outlets. The authors of the survey said the crisis had revealed a big shift online, with a greater willingness to use the internet for shopping, media, education and health. Two-thirds of Swiss people questioned said they would be prepared to do all transactions with banks and insurance companies via the internet in the future.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-02;Over 2,000 Swiss flown home in repatriation operation;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/repatriation_over-2-000-swiss-flown-home-in-repatriation-operation/45662014;Three flights from Peru, Tunisia and Cameroon arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday transporting Swiss nationals who had been stranded due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since March 24, over 2,000 Swiss have been repatriated on 13 flights organised by the Swiss foreign ministry. Those people who were flown home had been unable to organise their return themselves owing to travel restrictions caused by Covid-19, the ministry said on its website.  The historic repatriation campaign is being organised by the Swiss foreign ministry in cooperation with other countries. However, the tourists have to pay towards the chartered return flights and must stay in self-isolation at home for at least ten days upon arrival as a preventive measure.  According to the ministry, thousands of Swiss travellers are still stranded abroad. More flights are planned for the next few days. Two planes are expected on Thursday from Yangon (Myanmar) and Casablanca (Morocco). Flights from Phuket (Thailand), Quito (Ecuador) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) are scheduled to land in Zurich on Friday. On Sunday, a flight from Sydney is scheduled to arrive in Switzerland.  Around 1,000 people from other European countries have been able to join the repatriation flights organised by the Swiss foreign ministry. In exchange, an additional 700 Swiss nationals have benefited from repatriation flights coordinated by other governments.  This shows the tremendous solidarity right now, Johannes Matyassy, head of consular services at the foreign ministry, told Blick newspaper. The government last week called on all Swiss travellers to return. About 17,000 of them have registered with the authorities via the Travel Admin appExternal link.

2020-04-02;Start-up firms feel frozen out of coronavirus bailout funds;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/stifled-innovation_start-up-firms-feel-frozen-out-of-coronavirus-bailout-funds/45661794;A year after setting up, technology firm Microcaps is hotly tipped for success having developed a novel method of producing microparticles for the healthcare, cosmetics and food industries. However, coronavirus has thrown an almighty spanner in the works for Microcaps and other Swiss start-ups. Just like other companies, start-ups are faced with shrinking revenues, cancelled orders and mounting bills. But new entrants don’t have the cushion of a wide customer base, money in the bank and an established reputation. And neither, so it seems, do they have equal access to emergency bailout funds from the state. The CHF20 billion (around $20.6 billion) state-backed facility grants interest-free loans to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Loans are limited to 10% of a company’s revenues or a multiple of wage bills if they were incurred within the last year. But most start-ups take a few years to build up a meaningful revenue stream and cannot afford large salaries in their early stages. When start-up incubator VenturelabExternal link asked 438 young firms if the bailout would help, 70% said the loan system was of no use for them. In the start-up world, MicrocapsExternal link is in a relatively secure position. The spin-off enterprise from Zurich’s Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ), with eight employees, has enough funds to pay the bills until the autumn, says CEO and co-founder Alessandro Ofner. Expanding a customer base, however, will have to wait. Potential new clients are too busy keeping their own businesses afloat during the pandemic to see demonstrations of the new technology. Microcap’s long-term future relies on its ability to raise a fresh round of funding from investors – a process that had been earmarked for the summer. That might prove tricky, according to Swiss angel investor Daniel Gutenberg. “For new entrants, it will be all but impossible to raise funding in the next six months,” he told swissinfo.ch. “Even later stage start-ups might have difficulty.” The pandemic has caused investors, like Gutenberg, difficulties of their own. Wealth tied up in company stakes has taken a battering with share prices crashing in recent weeks. Putting money into start-ups in the current volatile environment means taking on more risk than usual. There may be some bargains to be had with young enterprises forced to offer a greater share of the company in exchange for funding. But Gutenberg says he needs to “keep his powder dry” to assist his current portfolio of start-ups should they run into financial difficulties. Gutenberg is also concerned about the fate of many Swiss start-ups. “The government is quick to shout about Switzerland’s record as the most innovative country in the world. But when the going gets tough it should not just be looking out for SMEs, it should look after start-ups too,” he said. Concerned parliamentarians have launched a taskforceExternal link to take up the case with the government. One argument calls for start-ups to count money contributed by investors as revenues. The government said it is looking for a solution for start-ups but it is also inundated with appeals from many other sections of the economy – from taxi drivers to airlines to the self-employed. In the meantime, several cantons have stepped in with extra funding, some of which is to cover companies that were rejected for federal loans. Olaf Hannemann of CV Labs, which supports blockchain start-ups, says innovation that will benefit the economy in the long run should be preserved in times of stress. “A significant number of start-ups are set to benefit from trends towards remote work, automation, online services and digital security. All are significant growth trends in their own right, which are likely to be further accelerated by the current uncertainty and long-term changes on the horizon.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Government plans to top up Covid-19 economic package;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_government-plans-to-top-up-covid-19-economic-package/45659558;The Swiss government is preparing an additional financial package to help the economy shaken by the coronavirus epidemic. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said the planned aid was aimed at supporting those small independent businesses that were ineligible for the first relief package of CHF20 billion (around 20.6 billion) presented two weeks ago. “The government is prepared to provide more financial aid,” he said at a press conference on Wednesday. “There is no question that the economy will suffer because of the crisis, but the government wants to minimise the damage.” Parmelin said the finance ministry would present a proposal for additional funds by next Friday. For its part, the economics ministry has been mandated to define the criteria for new beneficiaries within a week. The new package is destined for self-employed one-person ventures, including those in the cultural and the sports sector, as well as people working on demand. There are currently 330,000 people working as one-person ventures but 270,000 of them do not qualify for financial support, Parmelin said. By the end of March, credits worth CHF11 billion ($11.5 billion) have been granted and more than 86,000 businesses applied for unemployment benefits covering reduced working hours. This represents nearly 20% of the Swiss work force. “We are in the midst of a crisis – the worst to hit the Swiss economy since the Second world war,” said Parmelin. The government wants to ensure that those people in the labour market most affected by the current crisis can survive, he added. However, Parmelin again dismissed calls for tackling non-repayable loans and untargeted financial support. He said his ministry was considering measures to prevent abuses of the credits. He also indicated that the government is preparing different scenarios to crank up the Swiss economy, gradually easing certain restrictions on businesses.  Meanwhile, the government has decided to continue processing asylum applications rejecting calls by human rights organisations for a moratorium.  Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said it was important to remain within the rule of law despite the Covid-19 epidemic. Asylum requests will continue to be processed but adapted and deadlines will be extended, she said. She also stressed that the asylum centres will house fewer people than under normal conditions to take into account the official health measures on social distancing.

2020-04-01;MSF deploys Covid-19 teams in Geneva to help most vulnerable;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_msf-deploys-covid-19-teams-in-geneva-to-help-most-vulnerable/45660116;Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with arguably one of the best health systems, yet the scale of the coronavirus pandemic means that even the Swiss need humanitarian support. Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has 12 specialists in Geneva helping the main hospital as well as the homeless and other vulnerable residents.  “Today, in Europe some of the most advanced health systems in the world are buckling under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. Responding to epidemics is at the core of what we do – intervening when the system is overrun and where we can put our expertise in managing emergencies to good use,” said MSF International President Christos Christou on March 27. In recent weeks, the humanitarian agency, perhaps best-known for its work in conflict zones in countries such as Yemen or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has been scaling up its activities across Europe to Covid-19External link – in Italy, Belgium, Spain, France, Norway, Greece and Switzerland. As of April 1, the small Alpine nation has recorded over 17,000 positive tests and 464 deaths. Canton Geneva, in western Switzerland, is one of the worst-hit regions, with 2,700 confirmed cases of infection and 59 deaths.  “If you look at Europe, the situation in Italy, Spain and France is more worrying than in Switzerland. The health system here is organised to reply to the crisis. But it’s the first time that an epidemic of this size has hit Switzerland since the Spanish Flu of 1918 that killed 21,000 people. It’s the first time that Swiss doctors have had to face something so important,” said Patrick Wieland, head of mission for MSF Switzerland. “Our work in Switzerland is a sign of solidarity with the Swiss public, who support us for our activities worldwide. We need to be here and abroad, even if it’s a rich country. People need help. We bring an added value which is our experience learnt abroad.” At the request of the health authorities, two MSF doctors with experience of dealing with cholera and Ebola epidemics in Africa are supporting the main Geneva University Hospital (HUG) and sharing their expertise on how to handle large epidemic crises. The focus is on sharing advice on managing patients who have contracted Covid-19 and with the organisation of medical teams and services in the hospital. The Geneva authorities predict the peak of infections will arrive in about ten days.  “When there is a big influx of patients, they might not necessarily be used to seeing that kind of thing. They also need to take very strict measures to protect themselves and the patients. The doctors here know all that, but in theory – they’ve never really practised it for real. We can pass on this experience,” Wieland said. Under the coordination of the HUG, MSF has also set up a six-person mobile medical team to provide home-based care to the most vulnerable with Covid-19.  The caseload will include Covid-19 positive patients who don’t need to go to hospital but can stay at home, suspected cases that haven’t been tested and people who have been sent home from hospital but need to be monitored at home. Emergency cases will be referred to the hospital.  In collaboration with the Geneva city authorities, the agency has also given advice to local public and private mortuary services on procedures to avoid any post-mortem transmission of the disease. Around 3,000-5,000 vulnerable people are thought to live in particularly precarious conditions in Geneva. The pandemic has hit hard, disrupting local associations’ work with the homeless and migrants who live in overcrowded shelters, on the streets, or in poor housing. Many of these marginalised groups may already be in poor health and are excluded from the healthcare system. Finding food has become more complicated. The city of Geneva authorities and local associations were forced to urgently re-accommodate people in shelters to adjust to the new emergency sanitary rules introduced a couple of weeks ago. This week the quickly renovated Vernets military barracks opened for its first homeless tenants. The barracks and a refugee shelter will be able to house up to 530 people, mainly the homeless, currently staying in civil protection shelters and school gymnasiums. MSF passed on its advice for the new arrivals and staff in the temporary accommodation.  “We have put in place protection and infection procedures at the shelters in Geneva. This includes things like how to properly maintain distances between people, how to set up the showers and disinfect them, how to wash clothes and air the accommodation or transform certain things and prepare for a possible total confinement,” Wieland said.  The Geneva authorities’ strategy to accommodate the homeless together has been criticised by some people, who would have preferred the state to house them in individual unoccupied hotel rooms, as done elsewhere in Europe. But the city authorities have refused such a step. Meanwhile, MSF has also advised local associations and the authorities on the organisation of four distribution points which were set up in Geneva on March 28 to hand out vouchers for food and essential hygiene kits, nappies and soap for 1,300 families.  For the moment the medical charity has deployed 12 staff in Geneva, but its Swiss operations could expand. It recently carried out an evaluation in Lausanne on the situation of the most vulnerable and it plans to visit canton Ticino this week to see if there are any outstanding needs. ​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Swiss watch exports predicted to fall by 25% in 2020;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/troubling-time-_swiss-watch-exports-predicted-to-fall-by-25--in-2020/45660326;The closure of shops caused by the spread of the coronavirus worldwide will cost Swiss watch firms dear, but exports are expected to rebound next year.  “The Swiss watch industry will experience the largest decline in the past 50 years,” says a study published by private bank Vontobel on Wednesday. The projections are based on the assumption that stores will be open again in May or June.  The anticipated 25% drop in exports in 2020 is even “slightly larger than that recorded in 2009 (-22%) during the financial crisis”, said analyst René Weber.  Watch exports are expected to fall by more than 30% in March, following a 9.2% decline in February during which China, the origin of the pandemic, saw a decline of 50% compared with the previous year. For the second quarter of 2020, a 40% drop in the sector’s exports is expected.   Production is also an issue. Watch manufacturers such as Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe, Hublot and Tag Heuer have temporarily closed their production sites. Others like Swatch have resorted to reduced working hours.  With a possible resumption of activities in May or June, the second half of the year should show an improvement, according to the report.   Currently, stores have started to reopen in China even though the number of customers remains modest. Businesses began closing at the end of January, while in Europe and the US it was in mid-March.  According to the report, the watch industry should bounce back to post an increase of around 15% in 2021, as in 2010 (+22%).   The industry was enjoying good business until the coronavirus restrictions hit it. In 2019, the Swiss watch industry recorded an increase of 2.4% or CHF21.7 billion ($22.5 billion) in its exports.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Hail to the expert? Modern Direct democracy in times of crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/newsletter_hail-to-the-expert--modern-direct-democracy-in-times-of-crisis/45659428;"One of the new rituals in Switzerland is the almost daily Covid-19 press conference, where ministry officials in Bern line up to report on how the virus is affecting the country. Live-streamed by the national broadcaster, thousands of people (and not just journalists) tune in for guidance from the sudden and reluctant celebrities: Ms Ineichen-Fleisch from the economics department, Mr Lenz from foreign affairs, Mr Bock from customs, and – the superstar! – Mr Koch from health. It’s interesting to watch through a democratic lens: with parliament taking a breather and citizens confined to their houses, “democracy” in its most basic, participative form has taken a back seat, while the faces of authority are largely unelected, bureaucratic, highly competent experts. It’s also interesting to remember how we tend to view democracy and the role of experts during peace time, or whatever we call non-pandemic periods now. In January, at an event in Bern about the French “Gilets Jaunes” and direct democracy, ex-parliamentarian and law professor Suzette Sandoz gave a lucid overview of the challenges facing the Swiss system, including what she criticised as an over-reliance on experts. In a direct democracy, where citizens are sovereign, she said, there is a worrying tendency for decision-makers to hide behind the non-political and publicly unchecked advice of experts. A few years ago, during the Brexit campaign in the UK, cabinet minister Michael Gove made his now infamous “people in this country have had enough of experts” remark. And a few years before that, Plato was up to something similar in Greece, albeit on the other side of the argument, raising the idea of a “noocracy”, or a rule of the wise, to replace the rule of the fickle masses. Epistocracy (the rule of experts) versus the people: the debate isn’t new. But a crisis, it seems, can suddenly change the tone. In Switzerland, there have been some attempts to bring the voice of citizens into this pandemic. Most obviously, parliament has decided – despite scepticism about maintaining social distancing – to hold a special sitting in early May, to provide oversight on the government’s emergency decisions. “Democracy and the rule of law should not fall victims to the coronavirus,” warned Senate President Hans Stöckli. Others have raised the more idealistic notion of direct citizen deliberation: Professor Nenad Stojanović reckonsExternal link that “epistocracy is crap”, and that the eggheads themselves can’t agree on the best way to combat the virus. He says we’d be better off getting some quality testing done among a representative sample of the population, then letting citizens debate what to do next. But in such times, such calls seem like piddling into the wind. In Switzerland, the experts are in demand, and the authorities – so far – are trusted. A survey published earlier this week showed that just under 90% of the population think the Health Office is doing a good job; most Swiss citizens are doing what they have been told (stay at home! wash your hands!); and a reportExternal link released on Monday by Imperial College London cautiously suggested that the containment measures taken across many European countries (measures which were often based on statistical modelling, including by Imperial itself) are starting to be successful, in terms of saving lives. As for how long this will last, that will likely depend on how successful the advice and statistical modelling turns out to be in the longer term. Even here, experts are far from united, since science is not perfect, and (for the moment) neither are the data sources, as St Gallen economics professor Guido Cozzi told swissinfo.ch: “if data is badly collected, we will simulate wrong scenarios and policy-makers will make wrong decisions.” Let’s see if this is the start of a boffin renaissance, or whether we’ll go back to bashing them once democracy returns to normal. Internationally, there has also been plenty of expert commentary about the impact of the virus on democracy. Here’s Jan-Werner MüllerExternal link on the danger of governments or autocrats using such periods to grab more power; Cas MuddeExternal link on how the crisis will probably not lead to the demise of populism; Stojanović againExternal link (in Italian) on how such crises can be threats but also opportunities (e.g. the two world wars saw subsequent democratic advances for women in many countries). Overall, despite the optimism of swissinfo.ch’s Bruno Kaufmann, the message seems to be one of caution: when somebody – or a virus, as the case may be – punches you in the face, it’s an unfortunate but natural side effect that you’re unlikely to notice they’re also standing on your toe; beware viral power-grabs, as Müller says. And as Viktor Orbán’s successful move this week to expand his power to rule by decree shows, such fears are not abstract. Politico reportsExternal link that the new legislation in Hungary – which is indefinite – includes the rule that “individuals who publicise what are viewed as untrue or distorted facts – and which could interfere with the protection of the public or could alarm or agitate a large number of people – now face several years in jail”. It’s tempting to say that Orbán is hardly representative of Europe, or even the world at large. But in fact he is symbolic of the major finding of another recent publication, which was also nearly lost in the corona chaos: the 2020 Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) reportExternal link. The authors note that in 2019, for the first time in 20 years, more people lived in autocracies than in democracies – including the citizens of Hungary, which has become “the first non-democratic state” in the European Union. They also flag India and the US as major nations going in the wrong direction. “With the democracy report 2020, we issue an autocratisation alert,” they write. There is a more positive side: across the world, civil society is mobilising and demonstrating for democracy in larger numbers than ever – they cite Hong Kong, Tehran, Warsaw, and Santiago de Chile. Of course, if all the people are locked in their houses, they can’t demonstrate.  But at the end of the day, the ongoing slowdown of public and private life can hopefully teach us all a few lessons when it comes to being patient and committed to a common cause. And while the corona pandemic will be over at some point, the democratic journey is a never-ending one. Anything you’d like to hear more about in the world of (direct) democracy?

2020-04-01;Data tracking to tackle future pandemics via smartphones;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/pandemic-spread_data-tracking-to-tackle-future-pandemics-via-smartphones/45659818;Switzerland is contributing to a European digital platform that promises to combat the spread of pandemics by better identifying people at risk of viral infection. According to the scientists behind the platform, the system alerts anyone who has been in contact with an infected person without compromising the data privacy of individuals. Knowing who has tested positive for a virus is not enough to contain its spread. The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity TracingExternal link (PEPP-PT) system identifies who is most at risk of having picked it up without yet knowing that they too are contagious. Crunching data from a variety of smartphone apps, spread across multiple countries, the platform can pinpoint those at risk from infection and connect them with their local health services. It is being offered as an antidote to nationwide lockdowns imposed by governments that have no other means of controlling the spread of coronavirus. “We all know that as a society and as an economy we cannot go on like this for extended periods of time,” Marcel Salthé, an epidemiologist at Lausanne’s Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), told a media conference on Wednesday. “Instead of quarantining entire populations, we could focus on the very few people who need it.” Coronavirus has been so much harder to contain than the SARS virus because this time around people appear to be contagious before they show symptoms, Salthé explained. This intensifies the need to identify anyone who had been in contact with coronavirus victims before they even knew they were infected. PEPP-PT is set to go live as early as next week. Scientists from eight countries, including Switzerland, have been working on the system that will be incorporated in Switzerland as a non-profit entity. The system squares the circle of tracing people’s movements with privacy safeguards in place. Individuals can voluntarily download apps that encrypt their identities whilst tracking their movements. If they come into close proximity to a person who has later tested positive for a contagious virus, it will send an alert and connect them with the health authorities. Unlike other digital tracking systems that have been used to contain coronavirus around the world, the PEPP-PTT designers say their version will not simply pull data from telecommunications providers and hand it to governments. PEPP-PTT will also comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). “The idea is to make the technology available to as many countries, managers of infectious disease responses and developers as quickly and as easily as possible,” reads a statementExternal link. “The technical mechanisms and standards…fully protect privacy and leverage the possibilities and features of digital technology to maximise speed and real-time capability of any national pandemic response.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Swiss commodities sector grapples with Covid-19 turbulence;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-commodities-sector-grapples-with-covid-19-turbulence/45652956;The strategic importance of commodities and experience in handling fluctuations has helped commodity firms weather the coronavirus storm better than most. swissinfo.ch caught up with Florence Schurch, general secretary of The Swiss Trading and Shipping Association (STSA), to find out how the commodities sector is handling the crisis and what it means for Switzerland.  swissinfo.ch: How would you characterise the impact of the coronavirus health crisis on commodity trading and shipping activity in Switzerland? Florence Schurch: The global coronavirus outbreak has significantly impacted the global economy. Such impacts are inevitably felt in commodity trading and shipping activity given the global nature of commodity supply chains. Measures put in place by different countries to contain the spread of the coronavirus causes some disruption to the normal flow of the supply chain. However, the flow of goods is free from these restrictions so as not to break supply chains. The transport of goods therefore remains authorised. Certain arrangements and specific measures taken by the countries have a direct impact on freight capacities, the rates, the speed of processing operations, the delivery time. All ports at origin and destination are currently operating but activity has considerably decreased with none of them working at full capacity due to the restrictions and limitations. Delays will happen but cargo shall be released even if at a later stage.  swissinfo.ch: How are Swiss commodity traders and shipping companies adapting to this global health crisis?  F.S.: The need for the supply chain to keep moving becomes ever more compelling amid such global uncertainty in order to ensure that countries have the necessary stocks of their daily necessities. For instance, Swiss commodity trading companies work closely with the roasters and chocolate makers to ensure the supply of essential consumer goods for Switzerland, in accordance with the Swiss government policies to ensure the federal reserves of coffee and cocoa are maintained. In addition, some trading companies active in hard commodities [natural resources that must be mined or extracted] are now participating in efforts to produce ethanol, which can be used in hospitals for disinfection, and to make disinfectant gel. In addition, masks, syringes and plastic gloves are produced using petrochemicals. Sometimes traders are depicted as mean people making a lot of money on the shoulders of others. In reality, today, they are working hard to make sure that everybody can continue to live as normally as possible. And continue to drink coffee and eat pineapple or kiwi every morning. swissinfo.ch: What additional constraints are they having to deal with in terms of borders and bureaucracy? Are any commodity traders facing special challenges? F.S.: Well, it depends on the country. Honduras has implemented a complete lockdown as of 19 March, so trading companies cannot buy coffee or cocoa coming from there. Due to a shutdown in the country agriculture is at a standstill.  It seems that Peru is also thinking about doing a confinement quarantine but, as of today, they haven’t decided yet.  For oil trading companies - it is not just the coronavirus, it is also the oil war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. These two forces together have caused the market to respond in unusual ways. It depends on whether companies have sufficient cashflow to buy gas and oil when the market is down. It also depends on whether they have the means to stock it or not. Today the barrel is at its lowest price in the past 17 years. Oil trading companies are at the front and the market is unpredictable, the companies are the ones taking risks in this turbulence. If you think about day-to-day life, people now travel less so there is no need for plane fuel and lower demand for fuel for cars and public transport. swissinfo.ch:  Can we expect job losses in this sector? F.S.: I've had contact with traders of cocoa, coffee, cereals, oil, gas and electricity. Business has slowed down for all. They still have work, but it is difficult to say today what will happen at the end of the coronavirus crisis. For sure, it is not great. It is a shock but the sector is doing OK. Yet we can never be sure of anything. If it lasts for two months like in China, for instance, we don't know how small companies will be able to support that. It depends on how healthy the company was before the crisis. Among our over 180 members, we have a lot of small companies, not only big ones. In the small companies, cash flow is even more difficult. They will definitely need benefit from the different economical plans the Swiss government offers to SMEs [Small and medium-sized enterprises]. We really hope that no one will go into bankruptcy, but we never know. swissinfo.ch: Are we likely to see a lower contribution to Switzerland’s GDP growth from the commodity sector in 2020? F.S.: It is difficult to say. For sure, it will drop a little bit because trading activity is slowing down and it will take some time to go back to business as usual.  If you think about tourism, or restaurants, hotels and stores – they are closed for at least a month, maybe a bit more. Every sector's contribution to the GDP will drop a lot. Maybe the trading and commodities sector’s share of the GDP will make a huge leap because of this. That doesn't mean that we increased our business. It just means the others had a worse time than us. What policies can the Swiss government take to mitigate the economic fallout of this health crisis with regards to the commodities sector? F.S.: These are indeed disruptive and difficult times. However, the commodity trading and shipping sector is accustomed to dealing with turbulent markets and will remain resilient to fulfil its essential economic role. To ensure that the economic impacts are well managed and to provide support to the business community, the responses of the Swiss cantonal and federal authorities are crucial. STSA considers that measures related to taxation can become important to effectively mitigate the economic impacts and to support companies in having the necessary cash flows for their businesses. What would really help with liquidity is the ability to postpone the payment of VAT (value added tax) and social security and pension contributions for employees. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Businesses reach out to people at home ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/home-services_businesses-reach-out-to-people-at-home-/45659024;While most businesses have temporarily shut down, others are starting up or finding new ways to reach the public in their homes.  Some Swiss farm shops, like Thierry Miauton'sExternal link in Oleyres, canton Vaud, are delivering local produce to people’s doorsteps, so the clients don’t have to risk possible contact with virus-contaminated shoppers in supermarkets. The well-stocked farm shop can hardly keep up with demand and has taken on volunteers to help pack the produce. Sales have quadrupled since the government recommended that all citizens stay at home. Home food deliveries have been around for a while, but there are some new cultural services that can also be enjoyed by the public in their front rooms. For instance, now you can tap into a rich archive of films from different eras, thanks to the “Lichstspiel”cinematheque External linkassociation in Bern. The association maintains a unique collection of cinematographic material, which it is sharing with the public via livestream. The programme also includes live presentations from cultural experts. But if you’re more of a radio than a film buff, there’s a new online service called Radio 40External link, set up by two artists from Lausanne whose performances were cancelled because of the virus. Agathe Raboud and Semion Sidorenko wanted to create a platform for DJs and music performers. Listeners are invited to contribute to the featured artists, who are finding it hard to make a living in the current climate.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-04-01;Swiss Covid-19 fundraiser collects more than CHF10 million;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-solidarity_swiss-covid-19-fund-raiser-collects-more-than-chf10-million/45658638;The national charity, Swiss Solidarity, announced that it has raised more than CHF10 million ($10.4 million) to support vulnerable people affected by the coronavirus crisis. It began paying out money to several partner charities for urgent help, said the humanitarian arm of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) on Wednesday. The NGO had launched its latest campaign on March 23, calling for financial help to support the elderly and the homeless, as well as people in need who struggle to cope with dramatic income losses due to the restrictions ordered by the government. Besides the many loyal private donors, many local authorities and small companies pitched in, according to Swiss SolidarityExternal link. The charity appealed for continued community efforts and contributions via their website or their postal payment account 10-15000-6, using the reference “Coronavirus”. Since it was established 74 years ago, Swiss Solidarity has collected more than CHF1.8 billion in public donations to fund projects both in Switzerland and abroad, including CHF34.7 million last year.

2020-03-31;Swiss health official says virus infection wave may last to early summer;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-health-official-says-virus-infection-wave-may-last-to-early-summer/45657658;"The current wave of coronavirus infections sweeping across Switzerland should be over by early summer, a top Swiss health official said on Tuesday. We're counting on an epidemic wave that will have not only a swelling aspect, but also one that wanes, and will not last for years, but rather has a visible time horizon, Daniel Koch from the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told reporters in Lucerne on Tuesday. We're assuming that this wave will be over by early summer. As of March 31, 16,250 people in Switzerland have tested positive to the virus and 395 people have died, according to an aggregate of cantonal statistics. Ticino, Vaud, Geneva and Basel-City are the worst affected cantons. Switzerland has so far carried out 123,000 tests and has opened a drive-through testing facility in Lucerne which may be rolled out to other parts of the country. Health Minister Alain Berset warned that extraordinary measures to fight the virus would remain in force for some time, as vulnerable groups still need to be protected even once the number of infections began to fall. An “extraordinary situation” has been declared by the government, which has issued a recommendation to all citizens to stay at home, especially the sick and the elderly. It has announced a countrywide ban on gatherings of more than five people. A ban has been imposed on all private and public events and the closing of bars, restaurants, sports and cultural spaces; only businesses providing essential goods remain open. Schools are closed nationwide. The measures are in force until April 19. Berset said it was illusory to imagine that the situation would return to normal from April 20. He urged people to follow the government's advice, keep their distance, stay at home and remain “resilient” and “united”, despite the good Easter weather on the horizon. “The measures may be adapted at any moment. We have to remain flexible,” he said. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-31;EasyJet Switzerland seeks state aid as virus empties skies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_easyjet-switzerland-seeks-state-aid-as-virus-empties-skies/45657490;Airlines around the world are battling to survive the coronavirus pandemic. After grounding its fleet of planes on Monday, EasyJet Switzerland has confirmed that it is hoping to receive Swiss state aid.  EasyJet said on Monday that it had grounded its fleet of 344 planes and had no clear idea when it might resume flights. In Switzerland, the airline normally operates flights to Geneva, Basel-Mulhouse and Zurich airports. Owing to the global health crisis which has brought the European air travel to a standstill, the regional branch of EasyJet is requesting state support. An airline spokesman said on Tuesday: “As a Swiss airline employing around 1,000 people with local employment contracts, EasyJet’s regional subsidiary has established contacts with the working group responsible for aviation-specific support measures.” The German-language business weekly Handelszeitung earlier reported that EasyJet had submitted a request to the federal authorities for a cash injection. The Swiss authorities have set up an aviation working group to examine requests for support for the sector. Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) also hopes the Swiss state will step in to help it deal with the impact of the new coronavirus.  The Lufthansa subsidiary has reduced the frequency of its commercial flights by over 80%. Around two-thirds of its fleet has been withdrawn from service and numerous SWISS planes are parked at Dübendorf military airport, near Zurich. The skies over the small Alpine nation are largely emptyExternal link during the current lockdown. Flights across Switzerland’s airspace fell by almost 90% in March, the air navigation service Skyguide reported on Tuesday.  Global airlines will not start to recover from their worst-ever crisis until the last quarter of this year and any rebound will be short-lived if there is a new winter wave of coronavirus, the International Air Transport Association also warned. Many carriers, even those with strong finances, are struggling to survive. These are numbers beyond anything we have ever had in our industry, said Alexandre de Juniac, Director General of IATA, which urged governments to speed up bailouts for airlines facing estimated full-year revenue losses of $252 billion.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-31;On the frontline at a Swiss hospital battling Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/intensive-care-unit_on-the-frontline-at-a-swiss-hospital-battling-covid-19/45657348;Health workers at the University Hospital of canton Fribourg are doing their best amidst a general shortage of personnel, equipment and secure zones.  Fribourg is a rural canton close to the Swiss capital Bern with over 300,000 residents. Around 15% of the population is over 65 and therefore at high risk if infected with coronavirus. The cantonal hospital is currently scrambling to boost capacity to deal with a potential spike in new Covid-19 patients. The mission is to increase the number of beds and bump up the number of intensive care units to four. The hospital wards also have to be adapted to minimise the risk of infection.  “These are unsuitable for the current situation: they do not provide a sufficient level of isolation to protect the staff,” says chief physician Govind Sridharan on the hospital’s blog.   In addition to preparing secure zones, the hospital also has to source equipment, including ventilators. Another priority is training hospital staff on how to use the equipment, “because a ventilator is of little use without the skills required to operate it”, says clinical nurse Gilles Jegou.  To help train staff, the hospital has created explanatory videos on a variety of subjects. These include tutorials on wearing and removing protective equipment to avoid contamination, as well as on risky procedures like intubation where a breathing tube has to be inserted into the patient’s airway.   The hospital staff have also had time to learn from the experiences in Italy, as well as other parts of Switzerland. The doctors regularly check in with other hospitals to exchange experiences.   “Sometimes experts from other units give us their recommendations, so that we avoid making the same mistakes. It is very enriching,” says Jegou.   As far as the general population is concerned, Sridharan is clear about what needs to be done.   “Our care comes in when it's already too late, when the disease has already taken hold. Everyone can help prevent the disease: staying at home is a life-saving gesture!” he says.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-31;Swiss government launches Covid-19 scientific taskforce;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_swiss-government-launches-covid-19-scientific-taskforce/45656614;The federal authorities have set up a scientific taskforce to advise the Federal Council and to coordinate national research by universities into coronavirus.  The “Covid-19 taskforce” will be led by Matthias Egger, president of the national research council of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the government announcedExternal link on Tuesday.  The group will advise the government, interior ministry and other relevant federal and cantonal authorities. It will also identify areas of research and special measures or products that the Swiss scientific community could rapidly contribute to global efforts to fight the virus. “The Swiss scientific community offers huge potential to have a positive influence on the outcome of the crisis via research, training or knowledge transfer,” the interior ministry said.  It will aim to coordinate coronavirus research being done into diagnostic tests, healthcare, clinical research and contact-tracing via new digital applications, as well as related ethical and legal issues. The taskforce will build on a call by the SNSF on February 25 for proposals on research into coronaviruses “to tackle the current crisis and prepare for future likely epidemics”. A sum of CHF5 million ($5.2 million) has been earmarked for projects. The SNSF has received 270 applications, according to Swiss public radio, RTS, on Tuesday. The majority of projects were biomedical, including studies of viruses and infections, the immune response in humans and the spread of the disease.     The selected projects “will provide a basis for the subsequent industrial development of active agents”. The grants available are CHF50,000-CHF300,000 per project.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-31;Men are more susceptible to coronavirus than women;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_men-are-more-susceptible-to-coronavirus-than-women/45656194;Almost six out of ten people (58%) in Switzerland who are or have been hospitalised for coronavirus are men, according to Federal Office of Public Health figures. When it comes to deaths, men are even more affected than women at 60%.  It is not clear why men are more affected, Swiss public radio, SRF, said in an articleExternal link on Tuesday.  “Figures from China had already shown a similar picture and it was assumed that it could be related to smoking,” it said. “In China over 50% of men smoke but only a small percentage of women do. However, no clear results have yet been shown – more smokers have been affected, but the figure is not statistically significant.”  Among Swiss smokers the difference between the sexes is only a few percentage points, including older people. Although slightly more men smoke than women, this is unlikely to explain the 60:40 ratio in diseases and deaths.  Other factors must therefore also play a role, SRF said. Experts suggest the immune systems of women and men behave differently owing to the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone. “In women, the immune system often reacts stronger and faster.”  Other possible explanations are that women care more about hygiene than men. “However, it’s not clear whether this is also the case in times of coronavirus. But men go to the doctor less often than women and also later. It could be that men with Covid-19 tend to react too late and then become more seriously ill.” Switzerland is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, with almost 16,000 positive tests and more than 350 deaths as of March 31.

2020-03-31;Pandemic could cost Swiss tourism sector CHF6 billion;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_pandemic-could-cost-swiss-tourism-sector-chf6-billion/45656158;The coronavirus pandemic means Swiss ski resorts, hotels and restaurants are closed or at a standstill and jobs are at risk. This may cause a CHF6 billion ($6.2 billion) loss to the tourism industry this year, a study has revealed.  The survey External linkby the Valais University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HES-SO) found that tourism industry revenue could shrink by 18% in 2020.  The hotel sector alone could lose CHF2 billion between March and May. During a typical year it generates CHF10.2 billion in revenue. This loss is almost double an initial prediction by the head of the country’s tourism body, Switzerland Tourism, earlier this month.  On March 17, the Swiss government announced that all non-essential activities and businesses should close owing to the spread of the virus. Hotels are allowed to remain open, alongside grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, banks and post offices. But with the virus spreading worldwide and international travel impossible, tourism has come to a standstill. Canton Ticino in southern Switzerland and the cities of Zurich, Basel and Geneva will be the worst hit, the report predicts, owing to a dramatic fall in business travel, conferences and other international meetings. Turnover in this area is expected to plunge by 90% in April. The current crisis is different from previous events such as 9/11, the SARS epidemic or the crash of the euro, which had more regional impacts, the authors said. Some companies may be forced to close, especially in the Swiss hotel and restaurant sectors, which employ 250,000 people and generate annual turnover of CHF28.4 billion. In canton Graubünden in eastern Switzerland only 8% of hotels remain open, for example. A local hotel official says the virus could cause a CHF200 million loss in the southeastern region. HotellerieSuisse, which represents the hotel industry, said earlier this month that member companies expected revenues to drop by at least 45% for March and April.  The authors of the Valais university survey interviewed 2,000 people active in the Swiss tourism sector, including those working in hotels, restaurants, lift companies and other hotel-related services.

2020-03-31;What Swiss researchers are doing to beat Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/vaccines--drugs-and-immunity_what-swiss-researchers-are-doing-to-beat-covid-19/45655948;While Switzerland continues to be a hotspot for coronavirus cases, Swiss scientists and drug companies are playing an important role in the global effort to develop treatments or a vaccine for the virus.  “The scientific community has responded much more effectively to the Covid-19 outbreak than to the SARS outbreak,” Francesco Stellacci, professor at Lausanne’s Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) said.   Stellacci has been working on developing a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug for the past 10 years. In an interview published by EPFLExternal link, he said data had been shared very quickly and everyone has helped each other out.   “The scientific community truly grasped the importance of expanding the scope of research and sharing everything openly.”  The collaboration appears to be bearing fruit. Only three months have gone by since Chinese health officials first informed the World Health Organization about a cluster of 41 patients with a mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan on December 31. Despite the short time frame, there is a lot of progress to report on the research side.   The Department of Immunology at the University Hospital in Bern has been working on a vaccine since January. Initial sequences of the virus were quickly isolated. The vaccine has already been tested on animals.    Meanwhile, Peter Burkhard, an immunologist with a private laboratory in canton Basel City, has also developed a precursor of the Covid-19 vaccine, which has been tested on animals and he is now testing on himself. See the full report in this swissinfo.ch video .   There will soon be more research in the pipeline after the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) put out an emergency call for proposals on research into coronaviruses on February 25 “to tackle the current crisis and prepare for future likely epidemics”. A sum of CHF5 million ($5.2 million) has been earmarked for projects.    The first call of its kind ever organised by the SNSF received 220 applications. The majority of projects were biomedical, including studies of viruses and infections, the immune response in humans and the spread of the disease.    The selected projects “will provide a basis for the subsequent industrial development of active agents”. The grants available are between CHF50,000 and CHF300,000 per project.   The best defence against this virus is a vaccine, but since it is likely to take at least 18 months to develop one, a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug could buy us some time, according to Franceso Stellaccio.    While a miracle cure is still the dream of all those working hard in the lab, Stellaccio explains that a less effective drug would also be beneficial to society.   “Current data show that every person who catches the virus infects 2.6 other people on average. So a drug with an efficacy of 50% would reduce this figure to 1.3, and that would slow the virus’s spread considerably.”   It is often the case that a drug developed for one condition can turn out to be useful for other indications. In a promising development, Relief Therapeutics, headquartered in Zurich, is making progress with its erectile dysfunction drug Aviptadil, which has been found to be helpful in treating patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Sydrome (ARDS).    With the coronavirus, death is primarily caused by ARDS, in which severe inflammation causes the lungs to fill with fluid. Aviptadil is a patented formulation of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), a naturally occurring peptide hormone that is concentrated in the lungs.    Relief Therapeutics announced on March 26External link that it has filed an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in collaboration with an American drug development company, NeuroRx. The application is for a phase two trial of Aviptadil in the treatment of acute and moderate respiratory distress in patients infected by the coronavirus.    Also in the last week, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced it was launching a clinical trial of a potential new Covid-19 drug, another case of repurposing. Roche is working with the FDA and the US government to initiate a phase three trial to evaluate the safety of Actemra, a drug used to treat two inflammatory diseases. The drug is known as RoActemra outside the US. As reported on March 20, the study will enrol about 330 patients globally starting next month, including in the US. Actemra works by inhibiting the body’s immune response.   Meanwhile, a number of Swiss university hospitals – in Zurich, Lausanne, Geneva and St Gallen – are preparing to carry out serological tests to detect the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in the blood.    The aim is to estimate the proportion of the population that is already immune to the disease. The higher the proportion, the better the protection against a second wave of infections.    Today we know that we have a certain number of infected people but we don’t have the exact denominator, because only symptomatic people are being tested. It would be useful to have those numbers to better manage the crisis as a whole,” Gilbert Greub, senior physician at the Institute of Microbiology in Lausanne University Hospital told Swiss public television RTS.    Although many different avenues are being pursued simultaneously, there will be no quick fix to the immediate problem through a drug or vaccine. Professor Stellacci stressed the importance of managing the expectations of the public in this stressful time. “We have to be clearer about what we’re doing, the challenges we face and the time it will take. Otherwise we may be selling false hope.”   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Andreas Meyer, who leaves the job on Tuesday, hopes people will realise that alternatives exist to help alleviate packed rush-hour trains.  “During the crisis, citizens, companies and education centres have tested teleworking, and it’s not out of the question – I hope – that there will be lasting traces of it,” Andreas Meyer said in an interview with Le TempsExternal link. “This could, for example, be beneficial for a better distribution of travel between peak and off-peak times.”  Meyer, 58, explained that in response to the crisis, which he described in another interview with BlickExternal link as a “nightmare”, the Federal Railways had reduced its services by around 25% in three stages and the number of passengers has fallen by up to 90%, but the financial losses could not yet be quantified.   He warned in Le Temps that the hardest thing would be to restart once the crisis is over. “This will take time,” he said, as several projects have had to be interrupted to focus on priority maintenance work, which will have an impact on the schedule.  Pointing to the Ceneri Base Tunnel and Bombardier double-decker trains due to enter service in December, Meyer noted it would be a “big challenge” to keep on schedule.  He hoped, however, that people would now realise how many good options existed to avoid crowded trains at rush hour.  “You could get to work one or two hours later, for example, Or a high school could from now on offer certain services digitally.”  Looking back at his 13 years in charge, Meyer cited successes such as the 50% increase in passenger traffic, the development of the real estate sector, and the restructuring of the pension fund and goods transport branch.  However, he recognised that improvements were needed regarding punctuality. The problems “have been clearly identified and solutions are being implemented”, he said.  As for the criticism from staff and trade unions for having lost contact with them, he believes that “these feelings are linked to the digitisation of the company” and the establishment of a new dynamic.  “We were not always good at explaining to our staff what we were doing,” he admitted.  Meyer officially hands over to Vincent Ducrot, 57, on Wednesday.

2020-03-31;Swiss sailors’ amateur films inspire Zurich art show;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-a-ship-will-not-come-_swiss-sailors--amateur-films-inspire-zurich-art-show/45600620;" An active merchant marine may sound at odds with a landlocked nation such as Switzerland, but the country prides itself of its high-seas fleet. The discovery of film footage by Swiss sailors in the 1960s led to a Zurich exhibition that explores some of the most pressing contemporary issues related to the sea. The vast expanse of the sea its promise of freedom was what Ernst Christinger sought when, after barely reaching legal age, he left the Swiss village of Azmoos in the late 1950s to become a sailor.  During the following 15 years, he travelled the world aboard the MS Basilea, one of the most well-known trading ships flying the Swiss flag. Ernst and his fellow crew members documented their life at sea with Super 8 film cameras they had bought cheaply during a port call in Hong Kong. His son, Damian, found these films, along with a trove of other documents, postcards, photos after Ernst’s death. The sentimental affection was evident for Damian Chistinger as he scanned the material, shedding light on Ernst’s life before fatherhood. That landlocked Switzerland had a merchant marine might sound paradoxical. As a curator, Damian looked at these films and saw an opportunity to dive deeper into a not very well-known part of Swiss history. He teamed up with Roger Buergel, the director of of the Johann Jacobs Museum in Zurich, and the researcher Bettina Schuler, and together they expanded the scope of the material to develop what became the exhibition “A ship will not come.” Their collaboration turned into a reflection on some of the most pressing contemporary issues of life at sea at the Zurich museum. The project fell into very good hands. Buergel, the museum’s director, revamped the then Coffee Museum in Zurich (as the Jacobs Museum used to be known), transforming it into a sort of laboratory devoted to the exploration of trade routes and global issues through the interweaving of art, science and social research. The merchant marine used to stand high in the imaginary of restless youth like Ernst, explains Damian. They had limited prospects of careers and advancement beyond the rigid social life of their hometowns and valleys and found an alternative, freer life at sea.  But this exhibition is not a straightforward historical retrospection. It doesn’t show concern for official narratives. Still, the original footage, enhanced by the display of a carefully-curated show of artworks and videos by contemporary artists such as Adnan Softic and the Swiss-Brazilian duo Dias & RiedwegExternal link, brings to the fore the importance of Switzerland as a trading power over the last centuries.  The slave trade of the Americas, for one, used to be an activity to which Swiss companies, financiers and traders engaged wholeheartedly. Notwithstanding the Swiss political neutrality, some of its entrepreneurs profited immensely from business opportunities opened by the colonial powers, accumulating capital that still keeps the little Alpine nation as one of the leading players in the global economy.  Damian Christinger said he remembered seeing his father in tears only once: they had arrived at a beach in Greece for holidays. After a long time spent away from the sea, Ernst once again saw its vast expanse, and declared his “eternal love” for it.  But Buergel, the former artistic director of the prestigious documenta XII (2007)External link in Kassel, Germany, turned the footage unearthed by Christinger not into a sentimental display of times past but uses it as a tool to explore broader issues.  The curators wanted to contrast that romantic nostalgia with the experience of the millions of people who don’t experience the sea the way Ernst did, be they migrants or others whose lifeline at great peril depends on the sea.  It looks at the millions of refugees who brave the waters seeking an unknown haven away from murder, pillage or destitution; and the workers of huge shipyards at Indian and Pakistani ports, who at considerable personal risk disassemble ships for scrap metal. The title of the exhibition - “A ship will not come” - the title of the exhibition plays down the idea of a coming ship as the harbinger of hope; Instead, Buergel declares that the exhibition is devoted to the “sea voyage with an uncertain outcome – which is not to say that an uncertain outcome necessarily has to be catastrophic”.  Parallel to the exhibition itself, the museum has hosted a series of public talks. They explore human imagination related to the sea. It is a fertile ground to the invention of all sorts of sea monsters, tropes and metaphors for the awe and fears the high seas inspire. Cartographic designs tell real-life stories hidden in the diagrams and symbols. The Italian photographer and filmmaker Armin Linke reflects on the boredom and uneventfulness of essential matters, such as the development of an international legal code of the seas, where lawyers and lawmakers face the question of whether the sea itself – and any other non-human entity - deserves legal representation. He also looks at the legal, ecological and economic matters surrounding deep-sea mining. In another artistic depiction, the sheer scale of the sea vis-à-vis the human invisibility and voicelessness are explored, says Hannah Baader, a senior researcher at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, Italy, as she reflects how contemporary artists have explored the plight of contemporary migrants. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the exhibition and the planned public talks have all been cancelled until further notice. But the organisers said that the museum might extend the show beyond its scheduled closing date in May, and recommends that visitors check the Johann Jacobs Museum websiteExternal link for more.

2020-03-30;Swiss real estate market suffers fallout from epidemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_swiss-real-estate-market-suffers-fallout-from-epidemic/45654246;The Covid-19 crisis could spell an end to the previously rosy situation for Switzerland’s real estate investors. Investors in residential property look back on a successful 2019 both in terms of value increase and of returns. Forecasts for the current year were optimistic until recently, for both property owners and renters. The Swiss National Bank’s negative interest rate policy led to a surplus of apartments and other rented out office space, which in turn drove down rents.  Then the coronavirus crisis turned everything upside down.  “All the economic forecasts were wrong,” Donator Scognamiglio, chief executive of the Zurich-based real estate consulting firm, IAZIExternal link. So how will the property market in Switzerland market be able to cope amid largely uncharted territory?  Direct investments in the real estate sector have always remained extremely stable in past crises, notably when the so-called dotcom bubble burst in 2001 or during the 2008 global financial crisis. One reason for the stability of real estate investments is that rents continue to be paid even during a stock market crash, meaning any losses in value can be absorbed in times of crises. But can the the current situation be compared to past stock market crises? The looming economic difficulties are only one element of the whole raft of problems triggered by Covid-19, so events like the 2008 financial crisis are not a valid reference point for Scognamiglio and his firm. Instead, IAZI compares the current situation with the impact the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic had on the economy. There are “not enough forecasts or scenarios to gauge the economic and medical consequences of a disaster such as that flu epidemic,” the firm concludes. That also means rental income is no longer reliable. Most people will continue to live in their apartments and homes during the epidemic, but shops and offices also make up an significant share of tenants. And restrictions on social activities have put many such small businesses in financial difficulties. “We’ve never considered this aspect,” admits Scognamiglio. “What happens when the hairdresser shuts down? Or when the shopping centre is closed for business? And if the bakery suffers a drop in turnover?” The retail sector and restaurants in particular are expected to struggle with paying rent on their premises. But Scognamiglio remains optimistic about some aspects of the real estate market, which he assumes will ultimately recover as part of a yo-yo effect.  Although consumption is low at the moment as a result of the economic restrictions in place, some of the consumption will be made up for later, once restrictions are lifted.  Multi-family dwellings are still a safe investment, he says.  “Would I buy an apartment building in the next six months? Yes, of course! Can I consider myself lucky if I already own several apartment buildings? Yes, yes, yes!” emphasises the IAZI chief executive. But the situation for owners of single-family homes looking to sell is not quite as comfortable, he says. Many potential clients might feel unsettled by the economic situation and shy away from making major investments.  “Chances of a real estate crisis are very high, but it’s unlikely to be a big crash like the subprime mortgage crisis,” says Scognamiglio.  And he says a crisis can be avoided if there is no massive rise in interest rates at the same time.  Ultimately, Scognamiglio hopes that the measures ordered by the Swiss government, notably an economic relief package to the tune of CHF42 billion ($44.1 billion), will help stabilise the situation.

2020-03-30;Swiss firms rush to claim emergency coronavirus loans;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/heavy-demand_swiss-firms-rush-to-claim-emergency-coronavirus-loans/45654480;A third of a CHF20 billion ($21 billion) fund offering state guaranteed loans to small and medium sized Swiss companies has been used up just four days after being introduced. The loan facility has already promised CHF6.6 billion in funding of up to CHF500,000 to nearly 32,000 firms – an average of CHF207,000 per company. The speed at which loans have been claimed so far may justify estimates from economists that it will need to grow in size to fulfil its purpose of protecting SMEs from going under. “Of course, the issue of topping up is on the agenda,” Erik Jakob of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) told a news conference on Monday. “It is now perhaps becoming a faster topic than initially thought.” To help fund the bailout mechanism the Swiss government said it would double its issuance of short-term debt instrumentsExternal link to CHF12 billion. The planned volume of bonds will remain unchanged at CHF2.5 billion. But Switzerland will step up sales of own tranches that have not yet been placed as a further measure to support liquidity in Confederation bond trading. Another plank of the CHF42 billion bailout plan concerns some CHF14 billion to compensate employees for lost earnings when they are forced to work shortened hours. In less than a week, the shortened hours compensation scheme, which covers 80% of lost wages, recorded 70,000 applications from companies. In canton Ticino, which borders Italy and is one of the cantons hardest hit by coronavirus, some 40% of the workforce is on shortened hours. The Swiss average is 15.6%. But Jakob said he was satisfied that the scheme is saving jobs, pointing out that Switzerland’s unemployment rate of 2.9% remains virtually unchanged so far. Compensation has been extended to the self-employed, a luxury that freelance workers do not usually enjoy under the scheme. The authorities expect some 160,000 self-employed people to register, costing around CHF1.5 billion should economic restrictions continue for three months. Under the powers of the Epidemics Act, the government has shut down non-essential high street shops and services while some cantons have been allowed to order certain manufacturing and construction operations to close.

2020-03-30;Different continent, same virus: how families are coping;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-abroad_different-continent--same-virus--how-families-are-coping/45653720;Families separated by oceans are finding comfort in their shared experience under the strain of the coronavirus pandemic. Three mothers with a connection to Switzerland talk about the challenges of living far away from loves ones. You are only a flight away. The thought used to give Nicky Hueni comfort, living thousands of miles from her Swiss family. Nicky grew up in the small town of Wetzikon outside Zurich and now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her American husband and two young boys. “The hardest part is that if something does happen, I can’t travel to see family,” she tells swissinfo.ch. Her parents, grandparents and sister still live in Switzerland, but she worries most about her grandparents who are in their 80s. “I feel better knowing that my sister has forbidden them to leave the house,” she says. As airlines cancel flights and more countries shut their borders, Swiss families living on opposite sides of the planet feel both closer and farther away from loved ones than ever before. While families deal with the effects of the virus locally, they find comfort in the shared experiences with friends and family members across national borders. Families swap photos, anecdotes, fears and tips in group chats, video conferences and telephone calls. “We talk about what measures are in place where they are, what shops are open and how we’re all managing under the stress.” It provides some comfort to know that we’re in this together wherever we are in the world, Nicky says. Nicky was on a bus to work in San Francisco when she heard the news about California’s “shelter in placeExternal link” order. “I was so on edge that day. It started with news that the schools were closing, then it was the shelter in place order. It was a scramble after that.” As an accountant in the middle of tax season, Nicky had been putting in 50- to 60-hour weeks. This changed a couple weeks ago when the US government announced it was pushing back the tax-filing deadline by a couple of months. Nicky and her family drove to their house in Napa and she has barely left the house since. When Carmen Friedli returned from a two-week solo trip visiting family in Texas, she found a very different Switzerland from when she had left. “Everyone was living their day-to-day life in the US and two days after I got back, everything was shut down in Switzerland.” The American mother of two who lives just outside Bern caught one of the last flights back to Switzerland. “In the back of my mind I kept saying, ‘please make it home to my kids’. Later that evening President Trump announced he was cutting off travel with Europe.” On the same day that Switzerland shut schools so did many states in the US. But the sense of urgency hit much sooner in Switzerland than in her hometown in south Texas. People are still getting together for barbecues, she tells swissinfo. “I worry that people are not getting the full information there. In the US, people want to spin things into a positive, but in this case you can’t.” She adds that it isn’t until people are affected personally that they will realise the seriousness of the situation. Living in New York, which has seen cases skyrocket in the past few weeks, there is no way to downplay the crisis, says Jimena Färber. Jimena was born in Uruguay but grew up in Geneva where she met her husband. They moved to New York over a decade ago with their three kids. She remembers when things started to change. “Three weeks ago I started seeing people wearing surgical gloves holding on to the subway rails. Our doorman started wearing gloves and schools stopped allowing parents to go inside the school to pick up their kids.” Like parents everywhere, the real shock came when the schools closed. That’s when the family fled the Big Apple for Long Island, which is about one hour away, and have been there ever since. But it was what was going on back home in Geneva that really jolted her. A friend who works at a preschool there said she can’t leave because she has to make sure that there are enough people available to take care of the children of healthcare workers. “This brought me to tears thinking about how many people are trying to save our lives and how many people have to go to work to keep us safe,” Jimena says. What Nicky has found most challenging is telling her sons, aged one and four, that they can’t see friends and family, especially her father-in-law who lives close by. The other day her elder son told his grandfather via video chat that “we are staying away from you to keep you safe because of the coronavirus”. No matter where you are in the world, it’s challenging telling young children they can’t jump on the lap of or hug a loved one because of something they can’t touch or see. Carmen has arranged for her kids to play with one other family in the neighbourhood, but like many in Switzerland she is keeping the circle small. The kids learnt about the coronavirus in school, which included a very detailed demonstration of how to wash their hands. Keeping a routine and some sense of normality for her kids is most important. “We don’t want to make them panic if we don’t have to.” Jimena’s three sons are acutely aware of what is going on, although she makes a conscious decision not to watch the news with them. There was a case in their 14-storey building on the Upper Westside in New York. If the kids get too close to others when they are out walking or biking, people will tell them directly “make sure you keep your distance”. One of the biggest changes for all three families is shopping. “I’m not used to buying in bulk in Switzerland the way people do in the US. I usually just go to the store and pick up stuff whenever we need something,” says Carmen. This has changed as the family tries to limit trips outside the home. In New York state, shopping has become more complicated, Jimena remarks. “Two weeks ago the local store stopped letting people come inside. You have to call ahead of time and then pick up the food at the window.” Some restaurants have minimum orders for deliveries, so they don’t make a lot of small trips. Jimena explains that one place will deliver a minimum of 48 bagels so they order and split that up among neighbours.   All three mothers talk about the calm and quiet in a usually chaotic schedule with kids. The pace is already slower in Switzerland, Carmen says, but there is still this “quiet” without the sounds of cars and people everywhere. While in California and New York walks along the beach provide fresh air and a respite from the onslaught of coronavirus news, in Switzerland the forest is the refuge with young kids. Businesses and neighbours are also trying to support each other in any way they know how. In the Napa Valley wine country, which depends heavily on restaurants and tourism for business, residents are buying groceries from restaurants that are selling ingredients they can’t use. In New York, Jimena is supporting restauranteurs that have set up GoFundMe pages to help pay workers. Carmen is sharing tips and messages of support with parents and neighbours via group chats. But despite the common bond with her family in Switzerland, Jimena says she worries that a lot more people will suffer in the US. She knows her family are some of the lucky ones in a society where, as she explains, the health system has “two speeds” depending on your income and opportunities. “There’s no safety net in the US the way we have in Switzerland,” she says. “When I saw that in Geneva people were applauding health workers from their balconies, I thought we should be doing this here as well. As sad as this is, I hope something good comes out of it.” ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-30;Private Swiss initiative to import medical goods from China;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_private-swiss-initiative-to-import-medical-goods-from-china/45654230;A private, “citizen” initiative organised by business groups in Geneva is to transport almost 100 tonnes of medical equipment into the country next week. More flights are set to follow. The initiative is being organised by the local chapter of the Switzerland-China Chamber of Commerce as well as the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services (CGIG), who confirmed on Monday a story first published last week in the Le Temps newspaperExternal link. The groups were approached by nine cantonal hospitals and four pharmacy associations in French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland, who needed the material but were unable to find the right producers in China. After contacting the Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland, a supplier for the gloves, vests, glasses, thermometers and masks was found, and the first shipment of some 92 tonnes is currently ready to go, in storage near Shanghai airport. If export authorisations and customs procedures go to plan, said Vincent Subilia of the CGIG on Monday, the cargo will arrive in Geneva next week. Three other similar flights are set to follow. The total order, without transport costs, is worth CHF10 million. Cantonal and federal officials have given the go-ahead to the private initiative, which Subilia told Le Temps is complementary to the “remarkable” work of the authorities in combating the coronavirus.

2020-03-30;Covid-19 immunity testing to begin in some Swiss hospitals;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/gauging-the-crisis_covid-19-immunity-testing-to-begin-in-some-swiss-hospitals/45653466;Several Swiss hospitals are planning to roll out blood testing to evaluate how many people have already been infected by Covid-19 – including those who may have already built up immunity. The Lausanne University Hospital in canton Vaud – the Swiss region with most positive cases thus far – will conduct between 1,000 and 2,000 tests daily starting in about ten days, Swiss public media RTSExternal link writes. They will firstly be aimed at hospital staff and patients, as well as a sample of the population. Gilbert Greub of the hospital’s microbiology department told RTS that such testing would begin to offer a broader picture of the crisis, since currently only people with symptoms are currently being tested. Analysing a blood sample can reveal antibodies specific to the coronavirus, he said. A sample of 5,000 people, representative of the population, would be enough to draw broader conclusions. More knowledge on the number of people who have built up immunity would be essential for avoiding a second or third wave of infections once confinement measures are eased, he said. “Once a person has contracted the coronavirus, they are probably immune, and thus protected,” Greub said. “The question is how long this immunity lasts. […] The issue of mutation arises, and we could imagine that a slightly different virus would be able to re-infect such a person.” Greub said that some 70-80% of the population would need to be immune in order to stave off a new wave. No such test is currently planned on the national level, though hospitals in Zurich, St Gallen, and Geneva are planning them in their respective regions.

2020-03-30;Hopes rising that war criminals will be brought to court  ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-justice-_hopes-rising-that-war-criminals-will-be-brought-to-court--/45648912;With Switzerland’s first international war crimes trial in a non-military court expected to take place in coming months, Swiss NGO TRIAL International says such “universal jurisdiction” cases are on the rise around the world. Switzerland has several other cases under investigation but still needs to step up the pace, it says.  The long-awaited trial of former Liberian rebel leader Alieu Kosiah, originally scheduled to take place before Switzerland’s Federal Criminal Court in April, has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis, but is nevertheless expected to take place later in the year. Valérie Paulet, editor of TRIAL’s Universal Jurisdiction Annual ReviewExternal link published on Monday, hopes the trial will inject new life into Switzerland’s international crimes unit at the Office of the Attorney GeneralExternal link (OAG).  “I hope it will be public and there will be important media coverage on the subject. I hope it will motivate the unit to investigate and to send indictments,” she told swissinfo.ch. “We need to recognise it's amazing news that he's going to be tried, but it's been six years that he's been waiting for his trial, so it was high time.”   Kosiah, a former commander of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), is charged with war crimes committed during the first Liberian civil war (1989-1996), including acts of sexual violence, murders, cannibalism, recruitment of child soldiers and forcing civilians to work in cruel conditions. He was arrested in Switzerland in November 2014 and has been in pre-trial detention ever since, as Swiss authorities conducted investigations.    The case was brought by another Swiss NGO, Civitas MaximaExternal link, on behalf of Liberian victims, under a principle known as universal jurisdiction. Countries like Switzerland that have adopted this principle in national law can use it to try non-nationals for serious international crimes (genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity) committed anywhere in the world.   Former Gambian interior minister Ousman Sonko has also been in pre-trial detention in Switzerland since January 2017, while the OAG investigates him for alleged crimes against humanity and torture.  Human right lawyers and NGOs like TRIAL have been in the forefront of pushing universal jurisdiction cases to get accountability for serious crimes, especially where there is none in the country where the crimes were committed. Liberia, for example, has not so far held anyone to account for serious international crimes committed during its civil wars, although there are some cases also in other European countriesExternal link under the principle of universal jurisdiction.    The use of universal jurisdiction in countries around the world has grown “exponentially”, with an unprecedented number of cases, according to the TRIAL report. Based on 2019, 16 countries have ongoing prosecution, 11 accused persons are currently on trial and “over 200 suspects could soon be, too”, it says. The number of named suspects in universal jurisdiction cases around the world (207) was 40% up on 2018.   Paulet says the trend started in 2015 with the influx of refugees to Europe which “brought many witnesses, many victims and also many alleged perpetrators”. Now European countries are gaining expertise and even, like France and Germany, setting up joint units that work together on cases.   “Switzerland has some cases, quite a lot from TRIAL International,” says Paulet. “We do have six big cases ongoing, but I'm afraid they are not investigating that much. So Switzerland is not an example, clearly.”  NGOs and others have long accused the Office of the Attorney General of dragging its feet on international crimes cases. It is said to be under-resourced and there has also been concern about alleged political interference. In April 2018, the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture and on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers wrote to the Swiss government expressing concern about allegations that the Office of the Attorney General had submitted to political pressure, notably in cases against former Algerian defence minister Khaled Nezzar and Rifaat Al-Assad, uncle of the current Syrian president.  In a written replyExternal link, Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis refuted the allegations and asserted that “Switzerland attaches great importance to the fight against impunity, especially for crimes falling under international law”. But two years on, there has still been almost no progress on these cases, with only one witness heard in the Nezzar case, according to Paulet. In the Sonko case, which was also brought by TRIAL, she says they have “no idea” when it might come to trial.  The OAG declined to be interviewed by swissinfo.ch for this story but said in a written response that these investigations were “ongoing”. With regard to Sonko, it said that “the suspect is still in detention and the Swiss criminal proceedings are continuing. The OAG is closely following what is happening in situ and in other related jurisdictions”. A Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations CommissionExternal link is currently holding hearings in The Gambia and Sonko’s name has been mentioned frequently by victims, according to TRIAL, which says it has transmitted “materials, including testimonies before the TRRC, to the Swiss Prosecutor”.  The OAG declined to give details of its resources allocated to international crimes and whether they are adequate.   The TRIAL report also expresses concern about what it says is a growing trend for prosecutors around the world to charge suspects with terrorism, which is easier to prove, rather than international crimes. This is worrying, it says, because there is no international definition of terrorism, and victims are sidelined, since terrorism is a crime against the State rather than individuals. This is “a hard truth to accept for many survivors, for whom access to justice is a step towards closure,” says TRIAL.  The report cites the case of French Jihadists Mounir Diawara and Rodrigue Quenum, who were sentenced by a French court in December 2019 to 10 years in jail for terrorism. The accused had appeared in photos in combat fatigues in Syria, Kalashnikovs in hand. One of them was brandishing a severed head. TRIAL says the suspects “could have also been charged, in addition to the terrorism related charges, with outrages upon personal dignity, a war crime clearly defined by the Geneva Conventions”.   Paulet says that in Switzerland this is not so much the problem as the fact that the understaffed international crimes unit has merged with the terrorism unit. This is not a problem in itself, and has also happened in France. “It could be good to think that you have the unit on terrorism that works also on war crimes cases, because sometimes they are linked,” she told swissinfo.ch. “But the problem is when you don't have the human resources, you don't have the money and when you have a state that is putting political pressure. States want to prosecute terrorism cases because of public opinion.  Then it becomes problematic to have this union between terrorism and war crimes, because the terrorism crimes are going to take over.”        This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-29;How the mobile coronavirus test works;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/home-testing_how-the-mobile-coronavirus-test-works/45629058;In frustration at the government’s decision to check only high-risk groups, some Swiss cantons have started setting up their own coronavirus testing facilities. Basel Country and Bern are among them. They feel that without testing, cases cannot be isolated and so the chain of infection continues. They want to maintain the capacity of healthcare centres to help emergency cases, and not tie them up with testing. Basel Country became the first canton in Switzerland to carry out mobile coronavirus tests, with two teams checking people with symptoms at their homes. The primary care doctor must be contacted and request testing from the mobile team. Doctors in Basel can also send their patients to one of two testing stations set up in sports centres or halls.

2020-03-29;France drops blocks on face mask exports to Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_france-drops-blocks-on-face-mask-exports-to-switzerland/45652050;"After Germany, France has lifted restrictions on the delivery of hygienic face masks to Switzerland. Some two million masks are needed each day, according to the Federal Office for Public Health. The French embassy to Switzerland made the announcementExternal link on Saturday, paving the way for two shipments of FFP2 hygienic masks to go ahead from France to Switzerland. French authorities had initially taken precautionary measures to avoid speculation concerning sensitive products, the embassy wrote in a statement. However, the measures were not meant to block the export of such equipment to neighbouring countries also fighting the virus. “Solidarity is a permanent combat,” it said, adding that France and Switzerland are cooperating on various fronts to mitigate the effects of Covid-19. For example, borders between the two countries are closed to all but citizens, residents, cross-border workers, and goods; but authorities are cooperating to ensure flows of cross-border healthcare workers each day. Swiss hospitals have also accepted coronavirus patients from the Alsace region, to ease the crowding in some French hospitals. The latest such move on this score was also announced by the French Ambassador on Sunday, who said 20 patients would be transferred from France to hospitals in eight Swiss cantons, in both the north- and south-west of the country. The French announcement about the mask exports on Sunday comes after the director of the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said on Saturday that all blockages – including those from Germany – had been resolved. The European Union took the decision last weekend to authorize the export of medical equipment from its member states to the European Free Trade Area, of which Switzerland is a member. Bern has also decided to implement the decision in the other direction, and a licence is now needed to export masks, gloves, goggles and swabs as of March 26, the government said.  On Friday, Daniel Koch of the FOPH told Swiss public television SRF that the hygienic masks were especially important for those working in the healthcare sector, and that the country’s stocks would be reserved for this sector above all. The authorities currently have stocks of some 17 million masks, while two million are needed each day, Koch said. The French, meanwhile, are reportedly using 40 million masks per week, and have ordered some 1 billion, mostly from China, to boost their supplies.

2020-03-29;Swiss politicians divided over post-virus timeline;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-in-the-press_swiss-politicians-divided-over-post-virus-timeline/45652242;"As Switzerland prepares to enter week three of its coronavirus lockdown, some see the current situation stretching right into summer; others want a return to normality from April. Following the comments of Interior Minister Alain Berset on Saturday that the Covid-19 crisis “will not be over by mid-May”, the Sunday papers carry a range of reports on the timeline. Blick gets its hands onExternal link an internal report by the Zurich city security services, which reckons the “most likely situation” is a continuation of the pandemic, a further tightening of measures by the government, and a “massive extension” of the lockdown beyond the summer holidays. This would mean keeping the country in “standstill until at least the end of August”, the paper writes, a situation which authorities have up to now been reluctant to publicly envisage. Furthermore, Blick writes, the Zurich security forces document foresees two possibilities: the “most probable” would be a situation which in the coming days would see intensive-care units in the country overrun, and doctors forced to choose who should receive life-saving treatment. The second, “unfavourable”, scenario foresees an uncontrolled breakout leading to a “catastrophic” situation with widespread losses of life across all age groups. The SonntagsZeitung, meanwhile, carries a headline claiming that the right-wing People’s Party want shops in Switzerland to be back open again by mid-April. Citing concerns about economic damage, the party’s Thomas Aeschi said that all businesses like hairdressers, gardeners, butchers, electronic and do-it-yourself stores, and dentists should be allowed back to work from April 19. From a point of view of continuing to protect the vulnerable, Aeschi says, older and weaker people can still be protected if those coming into contact with them ensure they are wearing masks; he also says many more tests should be carried out to “more quickly isolate the sick”. And while on the other side of the spectrum, the newspaper writes, there is also a willingness to study scenarios on returning to normality, the timeline is more sober. Pierre-Yves Maillard, president of the Swiss Trade Union Federation, says that nothing can be decided until we know more about the extent of the virus and how many people have been infected. Social Democrat president Christian Levrat, meanwhile, criticises all such speculation as “dangerous charlatanry” – only health experts can make such judgements, he says. The NZZ am Sonntag mentions in its front-page story that one estimate puts the cost of each week of lockdown for Switzerland at some CHF4 billion ($3.38 billion). It also quotes Aeschi, and his idea that younger people, especially, might be allowed to progressively return to work as soon as the rate of new infections starts to slow; such concerns about getting the economy back moving again have also been raised by the centre-right Radical Liberal Party, the paper writes. Meanwhile, it continues, Professor Stefan Felder from the University of Basel has calculated the cost of saving each year of a human life, through current lockdown measures, at half a million Swiss Francs – “much more than we have been willing to spend on health until now,” he says. Morally and politically, the paper asks, faced with such calls and cost-benefit analyses, what are politicians supposed to do?   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-29;Parliament defends its ‘special session’ in May;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_parliament-defends-its--special-session--in-may/45651782;"After details were announced about the session to be held in Bern from May 4, the speakers of both chambers have defended the idea in the weekend press. In Le Matin Dimanche, Isabelle Moret of the House of Representatives rejected the criticism that the session represented a double standard at a time when most citizens are stuck at home. She also said the decision had nothing to do with parliamentary sour grapes over the decisive role currently being taken by the government in managing the Covid-19 crisis. “Parliament has a key constitutional role,” she said, adding that the gathering in Bern – to be held in the capacious Bernexpo exhibition centre – doesn’t contravene emergency measures that have banned public and private gatherings of more than five people. “The government has clearly indicated that parliament is not considered as such a gathering,” she said. Social distancing rules – maintaining more than two metres between people – will be respected, while parliamentarians that are either feeling unwell, or are part of an ‘at-risk’ health group, will be asked to stay away, she said. As for what will be debated, a key goal will be oversight of the executive decisions taken by government thus far. However, Moret said, parliament “also has the possibility to take emergency measures itself, like the government does.” On Saturday, Senate speaker Hans Stöckli made similar comments in an interview with newspapers from the Tamedia publishing group. Parliament is, even in a time of crisis, the highest authority in the country, he said. Although the executive branch is naturally more unified and capable of taking time-sensitive decisions, the constitution obliges parliament to oversee these decisions. Like Moret, Stöckli also mentioned the constitutional article giving parliament the power to enact emergency measures of its own; however, he said, in order to preserve government’s ability to act quickly and decisively, the chambers “would be well-advised to only deal with urgent gaps or very important issues” using such a mechanism. Only once before has parliament proposed such emergency measures, to clamp down on the activity of Al-Qaeda in 2011, Stöckli said. Government, on the other hand, has introduced emergency measures more often, for example after the 2001 Swissair collapse, or to bail out UBS during the financial crisis. Two weeks ago, the parliament – made up of the 200-seat House of Representatives and the 46-seat Senate – cut short its normal spring session as a result of the worsening coronavirus situation.

2020-03-29;How the Covid-19 crisis reveals cultural divide between Swiss language regions;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-impact_how-the-crisis-reveals-cultural-divide-between-swiss-language-regions/45647692;Switzerland’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has sharply exposed the so-called ‘Röstigraben’ – the imaginary cultural and social divide between Switzerland’s German, French and Italian speaking areas.  “A Röstigraben has appeared between French- and Italian-speaking governments determined to block everything to slow the spread of the disease and the more hesitant German-speaking cantons,” wrote the French-language Le Temps newspaper on March 17.  Christian Vitta, the combative president of the government in Italian-speaking canton Ticino, recently underscored these regional differences.  “The spread of the coronavirus is not the same in the different cantons. There are regions where the virus is more developed, such as Ticino. It's difficult to have a single solution for the whole of Switzerland. These measures must be modulated,” Vitta told Swiss public radio, RTS, on March 24.  In common with the rest of Switzerland, Ticino has already closed down non-essential high street shops and services. This was ordered by the federal authorities. But on March 22, the southern Swiss canton, which borders Italy, went further than other cantons by ordering factories and production lines to temporarily close.  With an eye on the spread of the virus in neighbouring countries, the federal government has had to tread very cautiously with the cantons, taking small steps to take control and impose a partial lockdown nationwide.  Different regional viewpoints on the level of threats and the Swiss response bubbled to the surface in a recent national opinion poll. It showed that almost half (49%) of all Swiss residents believe the federal government reacted too slowly to the spread of the virus. But criticism was most vocal in Ticino (68%) and in French-speaking Switzerland (64%), compared to German-speaking regions (42%). In all, 59% of French-speakers say the federal government’s measures don’t go far enough, compared to 38% in German-speaking regions, and 30% of Italian-speakers.  Trust in the authorities is split across the country. Around 70% of German-speakers say they have confidence in the leaders, compared to 45% in both Italian- and French-speaking regions.  Political analyst Michael Hermann, whose Sotomo agency carried out the survey, said the different levels of urgency in each region partly explains the different standpoints. But he added: “In French-speaking Switzerland, a majority is calling for additional restrictions for going outside, following the example of France. Cultural aspects may also be coming into play, such as the role of the state, or trust in individual responsibility, which is more noticeable in German-speaking Switzerland than in French-speaking Switzerland.” Hermann has another theory about the geographical spread of the disease: that Mediterranean countries are more tactile and are less used to social distancing than German-speaking countries.  Switzerland is a melting pot of cultures from northern and southern Europe, says Swiss historian Olivier Meuwly. In German culture it is assumed that individual responsibility will lead to collective responsibility, says the historian, which is a strange idea for cultures from southern Europe where “order is supposed to come from above”, he recently told Le Temps. Olivier Moeschler, a sociologist and associate researcher at the University of Lausanne, said he was not surprised by the poll results, which confirmed previous observations on cultural differences between Swiss language regions.  He said attitudes towards the state clearly diverged according to the language region: “French-speaking Switzerland refers more willingly to France and its centralist, state-driven model, while Swiss-German regions are closer to federal Germany… France is largely built on a top down model – a strong authority seen as a necessity, a structuring force, which may be feared, but where people have great expectations… while in Germany it’s more bottom up.” The notion of individual responsibility also appears to vary by region. In French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland there have been calls by scientists, in an online petitionExternal link and by local politicians for the authorities to impose a tighter lockdown. Meanwhile, in Swiss-German parts, politicians have mainly demanded the public respect the new confinement measures. Are Swiss Germans more self-disciplined and more willing to abide by the new rules regarding staying at home and social distancing, compared to French- and Italian speakers? This is hard to say. The government’s public health messages now seems to be better followed across the country. A survey in the tabloid Blick External linkof cantonal police forces across Switzerland reports this week that while patrols have been stepped up, few fines have been handed out and people appear to be staying at home. Deserted streets are the new norm in all regions.  An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Christian Vitta as the president of the Senate. This has now been corrected.

2020-03-28;How Covid-19 has hit democracy worldwide;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/-no-time-to-die-_how-covid-19-has-hit-democracy-worldwide/45650864;"The ongoing pandemic has put the entire world on hold. Public activities have been cancelled – even the release of the newest James Bond movie – while popular votes around the globe have been postponed. However, there is no reasons for autocrats, nationalists and populists to declare victory.    Things don’t look so good right now. Far from it, in fact. “Covid-19 threatens the whole of humanity”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a few days ago, referring to the pandemic which has put more than three billion people in lockdown, and which could unleash the worst economic recession in modern times. At this stage, nobody can fully gauge the extent and consequences of the crisis: “we have to understand that we are not the ones making the timeline; the virus makes the timeline”, said White House infectious diseases expert Anthony FauciExternal link after President Donald Trump had mooted a possible easing of coronavirus-related restrictions. In my own little town in Sweden I got a first sense of the urgency a few weeks ago when, after returning from a reportage trip to the Arctic, I saw the headline of my local paper announcing: “School referendum to be postponed”. The referendum in question would have been the first such popular voteExternal link initiated by citizens under a new lawExternal link adopted a few years ago. But this was just the first drop of a corona-related tsunami which has put participatory and direct democracy on hold in many places, including in my country of origin, Switzerland, where the forthcoming May 17 popular vote has been cancelled and ongoing signature- gathering campaigns for initiatives and referendums have been paused. It’s no different in other parts of the world. In the United States, where political attention has been on the run-up to the November 3 votes (on the presidency, but also thousands of other offices and issues), most signature gathering and campaigns have been suspendedExternal link. In Chile, where citizens last year triggered a comprehensive revision process of the Pinochet-era national constitution, the April 26 referendum on the issue has been suspended. Even in an electoral autocracy like Russia (which this year ranked 179th of 202 countries in the recently-published Varieties of DemocracyExternal link report), the pandemic has enabled Vladimir Putin to postpone an advisory ‘plebiscite’, planned for April 22, which would have put to the people a legal change allowing him to effectively become ‘President for Life’.External link​​​​​​​ And the democratic impact of the global crisis doesn’t end with suspended citizen activities and popular votes. Parliaments have also been bypassed in many countries, especially where the executive branch has declared states of emergency unseen since war times. Such cases include one of the frontrunners in the V-Dem report, Norway, where the minority government of Prime Minister Erna Solberg tried to bypass parliament by claiming unlimited powers through a “corona crisis legislation”. In Hungary, the National Assembly will vote on March 31External link to “indefinitely extend the current state of emergency”, which among other restrictions imposes “prison sentences on those deemed to be spreading false information” – false information in the view of Prime Minister Victor Orbán. But just as Daniel Craig reckons in the forthcoming James Bond movie – the release of which has been postponed until November 12 – this is “No Time to Die”External link for the most successful and human form of government in history – modern representative democracy. On the contrary. Just a few hundred kilometers off the shore of China, advanced and vibrant democratic nations like Korea and Taiwan have offered powerful examples of how to deal with the pandemic in a truly democratic way. While responding quickly and firmly to the threat of the virus, governments in SeoulExternal link and TaipeiExternal link also managed to uphold the fundamental democratic rights and freedoms of their people. In Korea, meanwhile, the forthcoming parliamentary elections on April 15External link will be held as planned – albeit with candidates campaigning under rather special conditionsExternal link. In Norway, parliament effectively fought backExternal link the government’s power-grab attempt, while in Switzerland, the two chambers of parliament agreed to hold a special session to scrutinize the comprehensive measures taken by government; even if, as it’s important to underline, the executive decisions taken by Bern have been fully in line with recently implemented legislationExternal link approved by a majority of citizens in a national referendum.    On the global level, in fact, there are very few reasons for autocrats, nationalists and populists to declare victory. On the contrary, the pandemic offers the world a powerful window into a future in which transnational cooperation, local autonomies and digital tools will play a much bigger role than today. Modern representative democracy will need to adapt to such a new global context in order to stay relevant and successful. That will mean a need to balance the current elitist, populist and autocratic features of many democracies with comprehensive reform agendas to further democratize at all political levels.  Back home in my small Swedish town, where the current situation will confine me for an unknown period, I will now have the time to assess the first local referendum process (and to make proposals for the postponed campaign) as well as to study all the documents related to the legal status of our river (as a member of the river council). In addition, like many of us, I will use the opportunity to learn to use the most modern tools for virtual meeting and collaboration. At the end of the day, the ongoing slowdown of public and private life can teach us all a few lessons when it comes to being patient and committed to a common cause. But while the corona pandemic will be over at some point, the journey towards (more) democracy is a never-ending one. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-28;Worst-case virus scenario hasn’t happened, official says;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_official-says-worst-case-virus-scenario-hasn-t-happened/45650562;Some 280 people are currently on respiratory support in Swiss hospitals, according to the latest update from federal authorities. But intensive care units are not yet overrun. Daniel Koch from the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told press on Saturday that the current scenario in the country is not as catastrophic as it might have been. “The worst-case scenarios which we forecasted a few weeks ago have not occurred,” he said. Ten days ago, Koch had declared that situation in the southern canton of Ticino, especially, was “dramatic”, and that the health system there risked being completely overwhelmed. Some 1,052 new cases of coronavirus were nevertheless reported by the FOPH on Saturday, bringing the nationwide total above 13,000. Its tally of fatalities stood at 235, slightly less than that calculatedExternal link – using regional aggregations – by some researchers and media. Koch also said that the 280 patients currently on respiratory support around the country signified “a huge number”, but that no intensive care unit was overrun, and that respirators remained available. As for whether the social distancing and lockdown measures introduced by the government on March 16 are having an effect, Koch declined to speculate. Not enough data is available and “it’s too early to draw conclusions,” he said. Health Minister Alain Berset, meanwhile, told La Liberté newspaperExternal link on Saturday that the corona crisis “will not be over by mid-May”. It’s wrong to assume that the epidemic will hit, pass, then disappear, he said. Experts say that the virus is going to stick around, and that the only solution will be to develop a vaccine – which will take time. He called for the Swiss response to remain “flexible” and “modest”. Berset also said that the possibility of a full lockdown and confinement of the population – like that in operation in France or Spain – is not completely off the table, should the situation worsen. “It’s a very tough measure, but has never been fully ruled out for Switzerland,” he said. However, “what counts are not the measures taken from above, but people’s behaviour.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-28;Swiss Post working overtime to cope with online shopping boom;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-post-working-overtime-to-cope-with-online-shopping-boom/45650298; With all but non-essential businesses and shops in the country closed, the postal service has seen its workload increase dramatically as housebound residents order online. “Two weeks ago, we noted an increase of some 15% compared with normal volumes,” Swiss Post boss Roberto Cirillo said on Friday in an interview with the CH-Media group. Since then, he added, volumes have been comparable to the period just before Christmas, while on Wednesday this week, numbers were similar to those of “Black Friday”. The demand comes as Covid-19 measures in Switzerland have led to the closure of all but “non-essential” shops and a recommendation that everyone “stay at home” as much as possible. Online shopping has thus become the method of choice for those in need of unavailable products, on the one hand, but also for those less keen to step outside. + What is an “essential” product or shop? For example, food deliveries have increased threefold, said Cirillo, which has put a strain on services and decreased the speed of deliveries. Swiss Post has begun sorting on Saturdays – something they usually only do during the Christmas period – and last week got the go-ahead from the government to also start delivering food packages on Sundays. However, Cirillo says, the social distancing measures introduced across the country have also meant that the number of employees in the sorting centres, and the conditions under which they work, have also been limited. Food and basic goods are not the only things in demand: Cirillo says oversized packages like bikes, sofas, and garden furniture have also been disproportionately in demand. Due to the difficulties of preparing such products under current conditions, the postal services are introducing a size limit as of next Monday: maximum dimensions will be capped at 150 x 80 x 60 cm. Max weight will remain as it is, at 30 kg. Other repercussions from the coronavirus pandemic and associated measures are an inability to guarantee next-day delivery for registered post, Cirillo said. Some post offices have also reduced opening hours, or closed completely, due to staffing or client shortages. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-28;Global cooperation needed to prevent Covid-19 drugs ‘free-for-all’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-pandemic_global-cooperation-needed-to-prevent-covid-19-drugs--free-for-all-/45648152;Nations must pool resources and agree on how information and technology is fairly shared in the global fight against coronavirus to prevent the situation spiralling out of control, warns Geneva-based public health expert Suerie Moon. Currently, more than 531,600 people have been infected by the virus in 203 countries and territories, and over 24,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally. Dr Suerie MoonExternal link is co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Geneva Graduate Institute and an expert in global health, governance and infectious diseases. swissinfo.ch: The World Health Organization (WHO) is facing immense scrutiny with the coronavirus pandemic. What’s your view on the UN agency’s leadership role? Suerie Moon: Overall, WHO has done an excellent job, especially given the limited tools it has available, whether legal, financial or other. If you compare the situation to the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic or the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic [also known as swine flu], it's really night and day. WHO has exhibited strong leadership and been consistently in front of the cameras, exhorting governments to do more and issuing guidance very quickly on a number of topics which are important for health workers and employers. They've worked tirelessly. Their work coordinating scientific research has also been essential.  We know that WHO's guidance is particularly relied upon in developing countries, where it is referred to as the Bible. So their advice and political leadership is going to be even more essential in the weeks and months to come as the epidemic becomes truly global. swissinfo.ch: But WHO has again been under fire, with critics saying it did not react quickly or strongly enough to the new coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year. What should it have done differently? S.M.: WHO has done many things very well under extremely difficult circumstances and amid huge uncertainty.  But some of their guidance has been puzzling. WHO's bread and butter is issuing guidance to healthcare workers. But here WHO is being asked to do something very different that is outside its comfort zone - issuing guidance on containment measures that have massive economic and social consequences. One of the critiques of WHO in the past and one that still holds water is that it's a very medical organisation. Its strengths are within the health sector but when crises spiral out of control and are not just about health – as is the case with coronavirus - the question is: “Who do we turn to then?” swissinfo.ch: On March 26, G20 leaders pledged to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy and do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic. On health, they committed to close the financing gap in the WHO's response plan and strengthen its mandate as well as expand manufacturing capacity of medical supplies, strengthen capacities to respond to infectious diseases, and share clinical data. Have leaders finally woken up for the need for global cooperation to fight the virus? S.M.: The G20 statementExternal link that came out on Thursday is a very encouraging sign going forward because so far international cooperation has been virtually absent.  I hope countries stop looking purely inwards and start paying attention to the deep and profound level of international cooperation that is needed to get this pandemic under control. The G20 statement really hit the nail on the head about the multiple areas where we need more robust and reliable cooperation than we've seen. At a very human level I understand why governments have been focused inwards as all the major countries we rely on to lead at the global level have been wrestling with domestic emergencies all at the same time. So it's understandable, but we cannot afford to ignore the international level and need to have international cooperation to put out this fire. I think the intention and the breadth of issues covered by the G20 statement is highly encouraging. But once things come down to money and information - where the rubber meets the road - and real resources and power, we'll have to see what pans out. swissinfo.ch: You have expressed concerns that looking ahead countries must reach global agreements to ensure that when effective drugs and faster diagnostics and vaccines are available,  they reach the people who need them most and first. S.M.: Before we even know which medicines we need, countries with manufacturing capacity are blocking exports and hoarding medicines. We've also seen this with masks and protective materials.  Imagine poor countries that don't have the diplomatic or financial muscle of a European country - they will be the last in line. Vaccines are coming down the pipeline in the next 12-18 months, but the drug issue is around the corner. We have small trials already reporting results and soon we'll have a clearer idea of what drugs, treatments and therapies are effective and when. We're going to see more data in the coming weeks and governments will have greater certainty as to what they need. The scramble to get those products is going to be unprecedented. It's going to be a free-for-all unless we can come up with a basic agreement on principles: products go to countries hardest hit first. This seems pretty basic but I don't think it’s going to happen. If we don't reach international agreement on how we share information and technology and pool resources quickly it's going to be chaos.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-27;How the virus puts the Swiss political system to test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/federalism-and-covid-19_how-the-virus-puts-the-swiss-political-system-to-test/45646244;News conferences and statements by politicians these days allow observers a privileged insight into the inner workings of the Swiss political system and the balance of power between the national and the regional (or cantonal) authorities. Ever since the national government began issuing orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus – gradually limiting the freedom of individuals, all but closing down public life – at the end of February, the differences of opinion between the Swiss government and several of the 26 cantons have become apparent. Be it the closure of constructions sites and factories, ski resorts, creches, the limitations on major public events and private gatherings (from a maximum of 1,000 at the end of February to five on March 20), a curfew for elderly people or easing the rules on unemployment benefits: Certainly, to an outside observer and notably the media, it came across as chaotic, prompting calls for strong leadership from the national authorities. “No, there’s no stalemate,” Interior Minister Alain Berset said at a news conference, dismissing the allegations that the national government and the authorities in canton Ticino had not been able to resolve their differences over the application of national regulations at a local level. Berset spent much time, trying to explain to journalists what policy principles the Swiss government applies and upholds. “We have to remain united in difficult times like now. Differences of opinion have to be discussed between the players at the table,” he said. “What we need now is plenty of good will and pragmatism to find a solid solution.” There is no shortage of experts who have expressed alarm over the apparent tensions between the various levels of government. Others have criticised how slow and cumbersome the federalist system and the search for a consensus are. Sociologist Katja Rust wants to speed up procedures by skipping the phase of consultations usually involving lengthy discussions, which would circumvent the traditional way of reaching a compromise. “This strategy does not work in times of crises,” she said in an interview with newspapers of the Tamedia publishing house. The question whether cantonal autonomy is a slowing down procedures is one thing, and the unanimous answer appears to be - yes, it does. But the real issue is whether the slow pace necessarily produces less favourable results than a centralist, top-down system. Both Andreas Ladner,External link political scientist at Lausanne University and political expert Claude LongchampExternal link, of  the GfS Bern research institute point out that central governments, notably in France and Britain, are not more efficient in handling crises. “Federalism produces adequate solutions, certainly in the long-term,” says Longchamp. “It is more flexible and innovative.” Ladner adds that it is crucial how the players adhere to the federalist system and how the cantons cooperate among themselves and with the national government. For Longchamp, federalism certainly has its downside. It makes strategic thinking very difficult, which is apparent in Switzerland’s troubled efforts to find a coherent policy on relations with the European Union, he argues. Ladner for his part, points out that tensions between the national and the cantonal autonomy are part and parcel of Swiss politics, but the tension between the two has become more visible now. Legislation on environmental issues or policy reforms of drugs, for instance, were introduced via trials at the local level as part of a national solution that overruled cantonal autonomy. Despite some hiccups, Switzerland’s federalism, guaranteeing regional diversity and the inclusion of minorities, has stood the test during the current Covid-19 crisis. No reason then for a major overhaul of the system, both experts agree. Longchamp says the current crisis by no means spells the end of cantonal autonomy, but it could lead to a growing awareness of national responsibilities. “Federalism will prevail because it is in Switzerland’s DNA,” he says, explaining federalism’s roots in the history of the cantons going back to the Middle Ages. It became a tenet of the political system of the modern Swiss state founded in 1848. Some experts even argue that it is as important if not more important than the principle of direct democracy – the possibility of citizens’ participation in the process of political decision making. There are sufficient examples to show that when the national government has moved to temporarily suspend or curb cantonal autonomy and parliament, it has not destroyed the federalist balance of power. A federal tax introduced during the First World War is a remnant of the federal government asserting its sovereignty, and the period of authoritarian rule introduced during the Second World War lasted beyond 1945. It took several years before centralised power was reined in and parliament regained its constitutional right. Pragmatism seems to have prevailed to a large extent in Swiss politics. It would therefore be no real surprise if the current tensions between cantons and the national government were to last. So far, all the disputes over inconsistent implementation or violation of a national Covid-19 regulation by a cantonal or local authority have been resolved. But there is no guarantee that differences will not emerge again. This is where another feature of Swiss politics comes in: consensus and compromise, albeit with a degree of political posturing during the search for an acceptable solution. Each side must be allowed to save face. The plea for goodwill, pragmatism and unity by Interior Minister Berset was hardly a coincidence.

2020-03-27;Swiss doctors call for better supplies of vaccines;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/continuous-shortfalls_swiss-doctors-call-for-better-supplies-of-vaccines/45649164;Swiss doctors are demanding improved access to vaccines following repeated shortfalls, not least during the coronavirus pandemic. Vaccine production has dwindled in Switzerland, leaving the country reliant on imports to meet its needs. Carlos Quinto, a board member of the Swiss Medical AssociationExternal link (FMH), told the Swiss public broadcaster SRFExternal link that stocks of Pneumovax, which helps patients with respiratory diseases or immune deficiencies to ward off pneumonia, have run out. “Patients are calling us and we then have to tell them that there is nothing left,” he said. The Covid-19 pandemic is not the only instance of the supply of vaccines falling short of demand, he added. National campaigns to fight against measles, mumps, rubella or the tick transmitted TBE have run out of vaccines before the end of the campaign. The main problem is finding secure supplies of vaccines, which are made in countries such as India and China but hardly any more in Switzerland. Vaccine production tailed off at Berna Biotech after it was taken over by Dutch biotechnology company Crucell and later Johnson & Johnson. Novartis sold most of its vaccine unit to GlaxoSmithKline in 2015. Switzerland applies different regulatory standards for vaccines than most of Europe, complained Quinto. In addition, it does not have the bargaining power of European purchasing chains. This makes it harder to get enough stocks of vaccines. “The government has to sit at a table with us to find solutions,” demands Quinto.

2020-03-27;Swiss cantons given permission to shut manufacturing activities;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-fallout_swiss-cantons-given-permission-to-shut-manufacturing-activities/45648390;Swiss cantons will be allowed to shut down industrial activities if they show a risk of spreading coronavirus, the government has announced. The ruling, which comes with strict conditions, follows a decision by canton Ticino to ban certain manufacturing production. On Sunday, Ticino, which borders Italy, ordered non-essential industries to cease production. This went further than a previous federal order for many high street shops and services to close their doors. The government had only authorised the closure of industries or construction sites that did not meet rules on separation of workers and hygiene. Ticino’s crackdown was condemned by one leading manufacturing association, Swissmem, which warned that production line closures could result in supply line bottlenecks throughout the country. Canton Uri had also been criticised for ordering people aged over-65 to remain at home, despite Swiss government measures falling short of curfews. On Friday the government said production line closures would be allowed if certain conditions are met. The health system of the affected canton must have reached saturation point, even after receiving support from other cantons. It must be shown that the industry cannot implement measures to prevent the spread of the virus and the shutdown must meet with the approval of “social partners”. Industrial curfews are not allowed to affect the manufacture and supply of essential goods, such as medicines and food, the government said. Failure to comply with the guidelines on the closure of manufacturing operations would disqualify workers from receiving financial aid from the state, the government said.

2020-03-27;Coronavirus brings existential threat to Swiss press, despite more readers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_despite-larger-readership-for-swiss-press--health-crisis-is-existential-threat/45647754;The Swiss media has seen a spike in readership and audiences due to the coronavirus pandemic, but at the same time, revenues from advertisers have shrunk. The drop in income has forced many private media companies to introduce short-time work for their staff, effectively lowering salaries by reducing working hours. This has led to newspapers cutting back on the number of sections produced - in some cases no longer publishing local news, while TV and radio stations are broadcasting limited programming. In French-speaking Switzerland, the Fribourg daily La Liberté is now only publishing two sections, instead of the usual four, while some radio stations in the western Jura region have implemented a reduced programming schedule usually reserved for the slow summer months. The Tamedia group, which owns numerous newspapers throughout the country, has also introduced short-time working. This measure is contested by journalists who feel that the conditions for short-time working are not being met since the workload has remained the same. Publishers have also been under pressure from journalists and politicians who have called on them to offer coronavirus-related news to the entire population free of charge, arguing that this is a public health issue: in order to fight the pandemic effectively, every inhabitant should have access to reliable, independent and quality information. Zurich-based Neue Zürcher ZeitungExternal link and Tages-AnzeigerExternal link (Tamedia group) have rejected this appeal, insisting that they must maintain their paywalls and subscription service at a time of drastically falling advertising revenues. But other newspapers, such as the German-language WOZExternal link, and Geneva daily Le TempsExternal link, as well as the French-language newspapers of the ESH GroupExternal link are offering unrestricted online access to their coronavirus-related articles. Both unions and media owners have demanded financial support. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-27;Intensive care beds could run out in a week, study predicts;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_intensive-care-beds-could-run-out-on-thursday--study-predicts/45647658;Switzerland will run out of intensive care beds on April 2 owing to the progression of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). Up to 1,000 additional beds may be needed throughout the country, it says.  Taking into account the current number of beds in intensive care units, estimated at 979, and the number of deaths linked to Covid-19, “our latest report suggests that the system is close to saturation, based on the available data”, said Thomas Van BoeckelExternal link from the department of environmental systems science at ETH Zurich and co-author of the report.  In addition to canton Ticino, bed capacity may already be exceeded in the cantons of Vaud, Geneva, Valais and Graubünden, he said on Friday in an interviewExternal link with La Liberté and partner newspapers. “According to our models, we will reach a [wider] shortage on April 2.”  From this date, if no action is taken, 86 beds could be lacking in Zurich, he said. “Shortages would also be felt in Bern and Solothurn. The situation could get much worse in Valais with more than 250 excess cases,” – or 1,000 in the whole of Switzerland, he added.  Van Boeckel stressed that this is an estimate, which is not based on the data that hospitals have been required to submit to the government since March 13.  The beds still available in the north, centre and east of Switzerland, as well as in the large hospitals in cities, could partially absorb the surplus of patients from cantons Vaud and Ticino, he reckoned.  The ETH Zurich researchers reconstructed the probable acute cases of Covid-19 to be expected, based on data from the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the number of deaths in canton Zurich and figures from www.corona-data.ch and by using differential equation models.  As of March 27, almost 12,000 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Switzerland and almost 200 people had died.

2020-03-27;Coping strategies: Indian students under Swiss lockdown;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-_coping-strategies--indian-students-under-swiss-lockdown/45642758;Unable to return home to India due to coronavirus-related flight restrictions, students studying in Switzerland are showing their resilience and inventiveness.   “Isolation is definitely not easy as a foreigner. It is not just your own well-being and the restrictions in Switzerland you have to worry about, but also back home, where you have elderly parents most of whom are suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure,” Rhythima Shinde, PhD student at the Zurich Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ), told swissinfo.ch.   Students like Shinde have to stay on top of Covid-19 information in two countries to ensure they are doing the right the thing.    “It can be very intimidating,” she says.   Newcomers can find it especially hard. Ninad Chitnis, a Masters student at ETHZ, has been in Switzerland for two years and is currently doing an internship at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.   I don’t know anyone here as I just moved to Geneva and I can’t make new acquaintances because of the coronavirus situation,” he says.   Compounding the situation, the pandemic hit Switzerland during the Indian festival of colours Holi, which is an important social event for the diaspora.   “From the student association's perspective, we had to cancel our Holi event which is disappointing but then again getting the epidemic under control is more important,” says Samarth Shukla, president of the Indian Students Association of Zurich (InSAZ).    Given the trying circumstances, the students swissinfo.ch contacted seem satisfied with how Swiss universities have responded. Many of the schools offer online courses and help students remotely by providing them licensed versions of video conferencing tools like Zoom.   “The transition was not very difficult. But this was easier for me personally as I work on simulations, and my work is not experimental,” says Shinde.   For those students performing experiments, access to labs has been restricted to urgent cases only. However, PhD students will still continue to be paid even if they are unable to perform lab work.    “According to the rector of ETHZ, the time where one cannot work on-site does not count as vacation. This means everyone will be paid their salaries and this non-working period won't count as a leave of absence,” says Shukla.     Some universities like ETHZ have also taken away some of the stress associated with exams. In normal circumstances a student can fail a course a maximum of two times. ETHZ has decided not to count exam failures in the summer semester of this year towards the two attempts limit.    Besides assistance from their universities Indian students have also been aided by the Indian missions in Switzerland. They intervened to help a few students board flights to India before the travel ban.    “There was confusion among airlines about cut off dates for entering India and we helped clarify the situation,” says Piyush Singh of the Indian embassy in Bern.    He says Indians in Switzerland are not panicking. Most of the enquiries are about finding out the earliest date they can visit India. Singh also praised the role played by Indian students in helping stranded Indian tourists by serving as their first point of contact until the embassy could intervene.  These trying times have also helped many Indian students to develop a sense of community. Shinde’s friends boost her morale through frequent video calls, watching Netflix movies together and playing online games.    She is also using her time in her home away from home to develop her culinary skills.   “I have not stocked up on groceries but I have a lot of dry food - mostly Indian stuff like poha, lentils, etc. - which is super helpful. I have definitely enjoyed cooking in these times,” she says.    Shukla loves to keep in shape but has had to adapt his exercise regime due to the restrictions in force in Switzerland.    “I'm used to playing sports and doing other outdoor activities. I'm not able to do some of this at the moment but still go out for a run or cycling,” he says.    Others are focusing on maintaining mental wellbeing through practices like meditation and breathwork like Shaili Gour, PhD student in neuroscience at the University of Zurich.

2020-03-26;Swiss scientists in a race to develop coronavirus vaccine ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/saving-lives-_swiss-scientists-in-a-race-to-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-/45644814;Swiss research teams are making headway in efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The Department of Immunology at the University Hospital in Bern has been working on a vaccine since January. Initial sequences of the virus were quickly isolated. The basis for the vaccine is a genetically manipulated virus that infects cucumbers and colours them yellow. It has already been tested on animals.  The head of the department, Martin Bachmann, is now calling for a simplified approval procedure to allow the vaccine to be produced as quickly as possible.  Meanwhile, Peter Burkhard, an immunologist with a private laboratory in canton Basel City, has also developed a precursor of the Covid-19 vaccine, which has been tested on animals and he is now testing on himself. He hopes this will speed up the certification process. His SAPN vaccine uses the same concept as for a malaria vaccine that his company has been working on over the last few years.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-26;Erosion of fundamental principles to protect civilians;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/10-years-war-in-syria_erosion-of-fundamental-principles-to-protect-civilians/45636412;The coronavirus pandemic is not the only news we should be paying attention to at the moment. This spring marks a truly grim milestone: the war in Syria enters its 10th year. How did the world allow this conflict to last so long? Were mistakes made, opportunities missed, or was there simply a lack of will? And did international Geneva, especially its humanitarian community, step up to the plate? My career now includes almost a decade of covering the UN’s efforts in Syria, from the attempts to deliver aid, to the Commission of InquiryExternal link (COI) set up by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. I remember when the COI’s first report came out. I struggled to find words to report the horrors I had read, and finally, live on air, said we were witnessing Syria’s “descent into barbarism”. There have been so many reports since then, and I am all out of words. It’s sometimes hard to remind ourselves that when those first demonstrations happened in Syria, in March 2011, they were greeted around the world as a sign of hope. “These were modernists, democrats, youth, who wanted to change the Arab world,” remembers Jan Egeland, who served for several years as chair of the UN’s humanitarian task force for Syria. “When it started, I must confess I was optimistic. I saw this as part of the long line of transitions from dictatorships, from authoritarian regimes, to more democratic, more human rights oriented societies.” But as Egeland watched, the demonstrations were violently repressed, the opposition became fragmented, and when he visited Syria in 2013 “it was clear that this was becoming a very polarized, very bitter, civil war.” In any conflict, the International Committee of the Red CrossExternal link is often the first aid agency to arrive, and the last to leave. When Syria’s conflict began, Fabrizio Carboni, now the ICRC’s director of operations for the Middle East, was beginning a new posting in Lebanon. He too admits to feeling optimistic for Syria at the beginning, and certainly had no inkling the conflict would last so long. “In the first months, no. But when I was in Lebanon, one night, we had 60,000 people who crossed into Lebanon from Syria. Just in their pyjamas. It was massive, abrupt, and violent. And I thought ‘OK, here, we are in something different’.” Listen to Imogen's interviews with Egeland and Carboni in our Inside Geneva podcastExternal link: How different, even the most experienced aid workers probably didn’t realise at the time. The struggle for Syria became, Egeland points out “a proxy war, where Saudi Arabia and Iran met, where Sunni and Shia met…foreigners were willing to fight each other to the last Syrian.” The consequent devastation, as Syrian forces and their backers fought Syrian opposition and their backers for every city in the country shocked Carboni. “I visited the souk of Aleppo,” he remembers. “This is the common history of humanity, with thousands of years of history. It was totally destroyed. I was there with my Syrian colleagues from Aleppo, and they were all crying.” “We reached the centre, the old spice market. And there was nothing left: just burnt stones, collapsed buildings. But there was still the smell of spices.” “It was something that characterized the war in Syria. There was no limit. To reach your objective you are ready to destroy your own history, who you are.” While Carboni and his colleagues struggled on the ground to bring relief to Syria’s besieged civilians, Egeland, as chair of the UN’s humanitarian task force, was in Geneva, trying to persuade the warring parties to show some mercy. In 2016, news came that people, including children, were starving to death in the besieged town of Madaya. “We were able to have some progress…because children had starved to death. Within 72 hours, convoys were rolling…but it wasn’t enough. “Besiegement is the middle ages. It means an army is starving out the opposition inside an urban area, and they seem to not care that they also starve women and children. That is a war crime.” Egeland, unsurprisingly, is hoping that there will be an international tribunal for Syria and that those who committed these violations will be brought to justice: “I don’t like anyone getting away with murder.” But, as a neutral, impartial humanitarian, he does not see himself as a witness in any war crimes trials. “Humanitarians have to try not to be part of a process that can be easily politicised. But I am glad that there are many documenting the war crimes, and I hope for accountability.” As the war ground on, the international community appeared to grow weary. “Too many started to treat it as if it was some kind of continuous natural disaster,” remembers Egeland. “This was manmade from A to Z.” Then, as ISIS fighters fleeing the fall of Mosul in Iraq joined up with rebel groups in Syria, the international community focused on Syria again. Not necessarily to end the war, but to defeat Islamist extremism. While the Syrian army backed by Russia pounded Aleppo, the US wing of the coalition pounded Raqqa. When the last ISIS-held territory finally fell, thousands of women and children, many the wives and children of foreign fighters, were detained in Al Hol camp. Conditions, aid agencies repeatedly warned, were dire: lack of shelter, food, water, and extreme cold meant many, including young children, were dying. Carboni was one of the first aid workers to get into Al Hol. “There was a mother, very weak, she was dying, and around here were six or seven children, watching her. And as a father, to see those children seeing their mother dying in front of them, it is something I will carry with me all my life.” The ICRC and other aid agencies were dismayed by the indifference of countries whose citizens, including children, were being held in Al Hol. True, their parents may have been allied with ISIS, but for states who had long promoted human rights to abandon children, possibly to die, in a squalid overcrowded camp was a shock. “It’s devastating,” says Carboni. “Let’s remember humanitarian values are the bare minimum: you can’t kill people out of combat, the wounded should be protected, and there is a special emphasis on children, on women. Nothing spectacular.” +Learn about protections guaranteed under the Geneva Conventions “For states who not only promoted those values for decades but lectured other states about those values, when they are affected by violence, to then say ‘yes, we did say children under 18 years old are victims…but in this case actually no.’ That is devastating for the credibility of the rules of war and the values we defend.” So the war in Syria, if it is finally approaching its end, has caused not just a devastating loss of life, but an erosion of those fundamental principles designed to protect civilians in war, the consequences of which may be felt for decades to come. Egeland remains frustrated that the international community, despite repeated attempts to agree a peace deal, or at least a ceasefire, failed. “Could it have ended earlier? Yes,” he says. “There was one seminal moment, the Kofi Annan plan in 2014. At that point, Russia, the United States, Iran, Turkey, the Gulf States should have said ‘we need to pull through this plan’. That was the lost opportunity and I will blame forever the leaders at that time.” So how does Egeland rate the performance of the UN’s humanitarian arm, with its headquarters in Geneva? “it was unsuccessful in the sense of being able to protect civilians from horrors. That is a horrific failure for all of us.” “But in terms of how many people got their daily bread, their health services, this humanitarian work was able to save millions. So let’s remember there were tens of thousands of humanitarian workers, mostly Syrians working for Syrians, but coordinated by humanitarians in Geneva. And I think we should be proud of that.”  You can follow Imogen Foulkes on twitter at @imogenfoulkes, and send her questions and suggestions for UN topics.

2020-03-26;Dirty laundry stretches Army Postal Service to the limit;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_dirty-washing-stretches-army-postal-service-to-the-limit/45646318;The mobilisation of the Swiss army to cope with the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in “more work than ever” for the army’s postmen and postwomen.  ​​​​​​​ Instead of the usual 1,000 parcels a day, they are processing more than 8,000 – on top of mountains of laundry.  “We’re noticing a massive increase in shipments – especially of laundry bags,” said Fritz Affolter, the army’s top postman. He added that the service was reaching its limit.  Soldiers and officers taking part in the historic call-up are not allowed to go home for at least three weeks. This means they are having to send their dirty clothes home to be washed.  For the 15,000 or so army personnel currently on duty, 80 members of the Army Postal ServiceExternal link are deployed throughout Switzerland, working in 28 army post offices.  The Army Postal Service has existed in Switzerland for 131 years.

2020-03-26;Who decides who gets access to the silver bullet to Covid-19?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eye-on-the-multinationals-newsletter_who-decides-who-gets-access-to-the-silver-bullet-to-covid-19-/45646102;In a panic, it is difficult to make rational decisions, but the effects can last far beyond today’s health emergency. There are some 70 drugsExternal link and experimental compounds that are being studied to treat the coronavirus and it seems that new diagnostic kits are popping up almost every other day. Amidst all this great innovation, is the burning question of who will get credit for it allExternal link and who will have access to the eventual solutions. Some NGOs are calling for affordability clausesExternal link and eliminating exclusive licensing to ensure that whatever silver bullet to Covid-19 is developed doesn't just land in the hands of those who can pay the highest price. But all of the uncertainty has led some governments to hoard promising drug candidates or restrict medicine exports, which some experts warn could do more harm than good. At a press conference in Switzerland, one reporter asked whether the Swiss government could demand that Roche, a Swiss company, set aside coronavirus testing kitsExternal link for Switzerland instead of sending them to the US. The same question could easily be posed to other industries from ventilators to food supplies. But multinational companies don’t usually have national loyalties in that way and as the Swiss head of infectious disease respondedExternal link, oftentimes one part is made in one country, and another part somewhere else. Many CEOs of “Swiss” companies not to mention employees, customers and business partners are from all over the world. Moreover, giving fast-track access to some countries over others based on arbitrary criteria flies in the face of some basic human rights principles. This pandemic is like nothing ever seen and it could rewrite the rulebook in the way multinationals operate, and if nationalism takes hold as many suspectExternal link, multinationals could be in for a rough ride.  What are your views? Send me a message: jessica.davis@swissinfo.chExternal link Some Swiss healthcare companies are coming off the sidelines in the race to contain the virus. This includes Roche, which received emergency approval for the first commercial testExternal link that offers results in less than 3.5 hours. Novartis also donated up to 130 million doses of generic hydroxychloroquine that is under evaluation as a potential treatment to Covid-19External link. The company also created a response fund offering $1 million in grants to support communities affected by the pandemic. Hamilton Medical, the Switzerland-based global market leader in the manufacture of ventilatorsExternal link, has ramped up production by 50% but is still struggling to meet demand. The crisis is also having ripple effects on other markets such as antibiotics. With more countries shutting borders, trade restrictions in India and manufacturing disruptions in China, there are concerns that potential shortagesExternal link and growing drug resistance could complicate treatment. This is especially true as the risk of hospital infections rise the longer people are in intensive care. The economic effects of the crisis go far beyond any best analyst’s guess at this point. It’s hard to believe that on February 19, the Swiss were celebrating another surplus External linkyear and just over a month later experts warn the economy is headed for a severe recessionExternal link. A survey of over 80 companies in Switzerland found that up to 85% of all export companies will be affected by supply bottlenecks within the next two months. A spokesperson from the Swiss industrial giant ABB told me that it isn’t possible to quantify the impact of the pandemic at the moment, but “ABB remains prepared for any scenario, including one in which we may be asked to again suspend production in line with government notices.” “Prepared for any scenario” seems to be the motto in such times of uncertainty.  Thanks for reading and stay safe.

2020-03-26;Chasing the numbers behind the virus in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_chasing-the-numbers-behind-the-virus-in-switzerland/45642814;"For those not on the frontline, the fight to rein in the spread of the coronavirus often boils down to watching an unfolding, sometimes confusing numbers game. And as swissinfo wrote last week, when it comes to pinning down the extent of the propagation, different reporting and testing approaches around the world mean that a completely accurate picture is hard to come by – even when it comes to numbers of deaths. Here is an overview of the situation, with data from various trusted regional, national, and international sources, current as of 26 March 2020. According to cantonal figures aggregatedExternal link by Bernese researcher Daniel Probst, the total number of positive cases on March 26 was over 11,000: canton Vaud had most, at over 2,000, while canton Appenzell Inner Rhodes (population 16,105) had the least, with fewer than 10. Per 10,000 inhabitants, meanwhile, the southern canton of Ticino on the Italian border – which has been a forerunner in Switzerland’s coronavirus crisis – is still the most affected, ahead of Geneva and Vaud. Note: the real-time figures presented by Probst’s corona-data.chExternal link open-source platform are slightly higher than those reported by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), which releases a daily update based on the data it receives from cantons. + More on the discrepancy between the figures here More than 160 people have so far died in Switzerland. When it comes to deaths per region, the south again bears the brunt. Ticino has recorded most deaths overall, as well as by far the most deaths per 10,000 people. Vaud and Geneva are next-most hit. Several cantons in central Switzerland have not recorded any fatalities at all. Older people, particularly men, are so far more likely to have tested positive in Switzerland; the elderly are also more likely to die as a result of Covid-19, with the average age of victims in the country so far being 85, according to the FOPH. Many of the victims had pre-existing medical conditions. In Italy, by comparison, according to data releasedExternal link on March 20, the mean age of a sample of 3,200 people who had died as a result of the virus was 78.5; almost four-fifths of the victims were male. This said, a March 24 survey of 30,000 Swiss by the Sotomo group found that younger people were more likely to say that the government should introduce stricter measures, while older generations were generally satisfied with the precautions taken thus far. In the same survey, meanwhile, French-speaking regions of the country were also marginally more likely to support tougher measures – perhaps reflecting the statistical fact that, so far, they have been more heavily affected by the virus than German-speaking regions in the north. In the graphic above, Switzerland is just behind Italy when it comes to the number of Covid-19 cases per million people. However, other sourcesExternal link, using the raw data supplied by cantons, reckon that Switzerland is in fact more heavily affected than any other country. Such comparisons are difficult, as many have pointed out, since different countries have not only different attitudes towards reporting cases, but also towards testing. More tests means more reported cases, but this is not necessarily a picture of the overall situation. Worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins UniversityExternal link, well over 400,000 cases of Covid-19 have been reported as of March 25. Almost 20,000 people have died. Around one-third of the global population is currently, in effect, living in conditions of lockdown. When it comes to deaths per one million people, Italy is by far the hardest-hit country. Opinions are divided as to why this is the case, with media reports raising various factors including the age of the population and the quality of the health service. Because of its status as the first European country to see a mass outbreak of the disease, Italy is also some one to two weeks ahead of many other nations. On March 24, speaking in Geneva, Health Minister Alain Berset claimed that Switzerland was now the global leader when it comes to the number of tests being carried out. This is reportedly due to many cantons boosting testing capabilities, including with so-called drive-thru systems, where patients can be tested while still sitting in their car. However, due to cantonal differences and difficulties gathering hospital data, exact statistics are again hard to come by. Some sources reckon Switzerland has boosted its capabilitiesExternal link to just below the level of Norway. The graph above, using data gathered by Cambridge University, presents the picture as of March 20. Since passing the bar of 10 fatalities, deaths in Switzerland have been on a trajectory similar to Italy, doubling every three to four days. It remains to be seen if the slight easing of the curve in recent days will continue. Authorities are still hoping social distancing measures introduced on March 16 will have an effect. At a time when life in many countries has been turned upside-down, various other graphs and data could be found to illustrate the effects of the pandemic: stock-markets have plunged, internet usage has spiked, and as the above stats show, international travel has dwindled.

2020-03-26;Coronavirus: Why staying home is merely a recommendation in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/q-a_coronavirus--why-staying-home-is-merely-a-recommendation-in-switzerland/45645252;Readers of swissinfo.ch have many questions about the way the Swiss are handling the pandemic. In this first collection of answers, we tackle social distancing measures and how the population is taking them onboard. Switzerland has progressively tightened measures aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19 across the country. The government has banned gatherings of more than five people in public places and advised everyone to stay at home. But as readers point out, the measures have left some room for interpretation. The government has urged all residents, especially those 65 and older or who are ill, to stay at home. But they can still leave the house to go to work – if telework is not possible – see the doctor, go to the pharmacy, buy groceries or help another person.  Federal authorities have stopped short of making confinement an obligation as neighbouring countries like France and Italy have done. People in France for example, need to carry a document attesting to their reasons for leaving the house or face hefty fines. “As we have seen in other countries, people do not comply well with decisions taken at the top that are deemed too harsh,” Alain Berset, interior minister responsible for health matters, told a press conference.  “This is a very Swiss approach,” he added. “The government doesn’t impose restrictions that people can’t understand.” Berset instead appealed to people’s spirit of citizenship and sense of responsibility to take the measures seriously.  In a survey carried out by the Sotomo institute and published on March 24, the vast majority of people polled said they had gone out in the previous week – though most said they had come into close contact with fewer than five people. Just a quarter of people 65 and older said they had adhered fully to the measures. Getting out for some fresh air is not forbidden. The head of infectious diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health, Daniel Koch, suggested that people go for a walk on their own or with members of the same household. Maintaining a distance of two metres from others is recommended. Parents can take their children out for a bicycle ride. But kids should not play in groups larger than five, the public health office advises. The elderly should avoid all contact with children. The federal government has ordered all schools to remain closed until at least April 19. But it has asked crèches to stay open or offer parents alternative group childcare solutions. This is partly to avoid a situation where people over 65 – who are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they are infected with the coronavirus – end up babysitting grandchildren. An additional consideration is parents working in essential services, such as healthcare, who cannot look after their kids at home. Some crèches have decided to prioritize places for these children. But the situation also varies across cantons. Some daycare centres have closed following decisions by municipal or cantonal authorities, or simply for lack of demand – many parents are choosing to keep their children at home. Crèches and other childcare facilities that remain open, like in canton BernExternal link, must limit groups of children, usually to a maximum of five.  The federal government is advising people over 65 or who are ill to stay at home. Daniel Koch of the public health office even suggested that the elderly should not be going to the supermarket but should instead seek help – from relatives or neighbours, for example – to get their groceries.  In canton Ticino, which has been especially hard-hit by the virus, retail giant Migros has said it will not allow people aged 65 or older to enter its supermarkets, according to media reportsExternal link. But the recommendation to avoid supermarkets does not mean people should not venture out. Pro SenectuteExternal link, Switzerland’s leading organization for the elderly, suggests to those living in rural areas to visit farmers’ stands, which it says tend to be less frequented than shops in the city.  Across the country, random acts of kindness as well as organized support groups have sprung up to help those who are especially at risk. Pro Senectute offers a meal-delivery service plus plenty of advice on how those confined at home can connect with people in their community, whether for help with errands or to maintain social contact virtually or by phone.  Facebook groups and apps such as Five upExternal link, partly financed by the Swiss Red Cross, let volunteers connect with people looking for help in their area. Simply posting a flyer on an apartment building notice board has also been a popular way for younger people to let their elderly neighbours know they can lend a helping hand.

2020-03-26;Companies across Switzerland contemplate bleak coronavirus outlook;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/survey-results_companies-contemplate-bleak-coronavirus-outlook/45645060;Swiss companies are reporting slumping sales, cashflow problems and bottlenecks in the supply of crucial materials as the coronavirus crisis hits the economy. However, a survey also found that three out of four firms are satisfied with a CHF42 billion ($43 billion) state bailout package. The 84 respondents to the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse) survey paint a grim picture of trading conditions. They expect the situation to get worse and last at least six months before seeing any signs of improvement. For example, textiles manufacturers are unable to sell their current inventories while the declining European automobile industry is hitting Swiss suppliers to the sector. Non-essential high street shops and services have been told to close their doors, while some cantons are clamping down on construction sites and canton Ticino, bordering Italy, has told some industrial production lines to cease operating. The government has announced a CHF42 billion emergency funding package, including CHF20 billion of cheap loans. Some economists expect the total bill to soar beyond CHF100 billion if the pandemic conditions do not ease until the end of the year. Respondents to the economiesuisse survey expect sales to slump by a third in the coming weeks. Several report that they are not being paid by companies that they supply. A third of firms are already experiencing cashflow problems, with that proportion expected to soon reach a half of all businesses. Companies also report delivery bottlenecks, particularly for flavors, vitamins, packaging materials, building materials, alcohol, glycerin, medical goods, rare earths and magnets. Economiesuisse expects that up to 85% of all export companies will be affected by supply bottlenecks within the next two months. Two-thirds of survey respondents are looking at reducing working hours for their staff and nearly a third are contemplating lay-offs among their workforce. But 75% of companies believe the government’s financial bailout will be sufficient to pull them out of the crisis. The number of positive responses rose from the 50% that were satisfied with a previous government pledge to provide CHF10 billion.

2020-03-26;Gold bars in short supply due to coronavirus disruption;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/market-turbulence_gold-bars-in-short-supply-due-to-coronavirus-disruption/45644826;Traders have reported a growing global shortage of gold bars, as the coronavirus outbreak both disrupts supply and stokes demand, with one business comparing the frenzied buying of the yellow metal with the consumer rush for toilet roll.  Retail investors in Europe and the US have bought up gold and silver bars and coins over the past two weeks in an effort to protect their money from the collapse in global stock prices and many currencies.  But Europe’s largest gold refineries have struggled to keep up because of the region’s widening shutdown. Valcambi, Pamp and Argor-Heraeus are all based in the Swiss region of Ticino, near the border with Italy. Local authorities announced in recent days that production in the area was to be temporarily halted. The gold price hit a seven-year high on March 9 of more than $1,700 (CHF1,650) a troy ounce as the deepening economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak sent investors scurrying for haven assets. But gold has since been swept up in the selling frenzy, with some investors needing to offload their holdings to free up cash, pushing the price down to about $1,530 on Monday afternoon. Most of the selling has been in gold futures or exchange traded funds backed by the metal. During the same period, retail demand for physical gold bars has surged. Retailers have already reported shortages and delays of up to 15 days on shipments. Markus Krall, chief executive of German precious metals retailer Degussa, said it was struggling to meet customer appetite for gold bars and coins and had to turn to the wholesale markets. Demand is running at up to five times the normal daily amount, he said.  “We are being creative to find new sources but what is driving it all are the measures by authorities to stop coronavirus. This is so unpredictable,” added Krall. ‘Quite extraordinary’ Rob Halliday-Stein, founder and managing director of Birmingham-based BullionbyPost, said the situation was unprecedented. “Basically we’re selling as soon as we get stock on location in secure vaults – but we’re restricted to what we can get hold of. It’s a bit like toilet roll.”  While London’s gold vaults are full of gold bars, they are of the 400-ounce variety traded by large banks such as HSBC and JPMorgan, not the smaller bars that retail customers buy, which tend to be 1kg (35 ounces) or lighter.  “I don’t think you will find a kilobar presently in Europe and the US for love nor money,” Ross Norman, a veteran gold trader, said. “It’s quite extraordinary.” Ken Lewis, chief executive of Apmex, a US precious-metals retailer, said in the past week that the “product has become increasingly difficult to source as the market becomes more volatile day by day”. The company said it had purchased more than one million ounces of silver grain and bars, more than 20,000 American Gold Eagles coins, thousands of gold bars, and “anything else we can find utilising our many partners and mint relationships”.  JM Bullion, another US-based precious metals retailer, said customer orders would be delayed by 15 days, and introduced a minimum order size.  BullionStar, a Singapore-based precious metals retailer, said it was paying a premium to buy back silver and gold coins from customers in an effort to replenish supplies, according to Ronan Manly, one of its analysts. “There’s a disconnect between prices in the physical gold market and the prices you see on your screen,” he said.

2020-03-26;Mobile phone data show Swiss are keeping their distance ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_mobile-phone-data-show-swiss-are-keeping-their-distance-/45644704;The analysis of anonymised data collected by Swisscom and given to the government has revealed that the Swiss population is behaving in a disciplined manner and is following the guidelines set out by the federal authorities to contain the spread of Covid-19. Health Minister Alain Berset confirmed on Wednesday that, at the government’s request, the country’s largest mobile operator was detecting crowds via mobile phones. The analysis of the data, which are anonymised and delivered with a 24-hour delay, is handed to the government for the specific purpose of limiting the coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland. Daniel KochExternal link, head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), stressed on Thursday that this was “not surveillance”. He said the live movements of phone users could not be traced. He explained it was a question of seeing whether there were patterns in the movements – and only in public spaces. “It’s a simple reflection of past mobility in public.” The measure is completely anonymous and completely safe in terms of data protection, Koch said. The Swiss government has banned gatherings of more than five people and has closed bars, schools, restaurants and other non-essential shops as part of “social distancing” measures to contain the virus that has infected more than 10,000 people in the country. Under the arrangement, Swisscom informs federal authorities when 20 mobile phones are found within an area of 10,000 square metres (100 metres by 100 metres) in public spaces. Residential areas and business premises are not analysed. In response to reports by French-language paper Le TempsExternal link, Swisscom spokesperson Christian Neuhaus told news agency Keystone-SDA that there is no live tracking of people but rather data from SIM cards are shared a day later. The use of technology to monitor those in quarantine and to track infections has raised concerns about possible privacy violations and raised the prospect of a state surveillance. The Chinese government reportedly used technology tools such as facial recognition and mobile tracking appsExternal link to monitor health status and movements of the population at the centre of the Covid-19 outbreak that some people considered excessively intrusive. At a press conference, Berset sought to assuage these concerns, confirming that there was no intention to carry out real-time monitoring of individuals. Only a few people at the Federal Office of Public Health have access to data and that the data made it possible to observe “the past in an anonymised and globalised manner”, Berset said. On Wednesday, an association of mobile operatorsExternal link announced that Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Orange and five other telecoms providers had agreed to share mobile phone location data with the European Commission to track the spread of the coronavirus. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-26;Who is Switzerland’s ‘Mr Coronavirus’?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_who-is-switzerland-s--mr-coronavirus--/45643236;"After years working as a Red Cross doctor in war zones around the world, Daniel Koch has become the face of the Swiss government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Koch has been thrust into the spotlight; his face is everywhere, on television screens and newspaper front pages across Switzerland. The head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has become a key figure, helping explain the spread of the virus in Switzerland to millions of residents confined in their homes. He is the man answering journalists’ difficult questions in Bern, stressing that the “situation is dramatic” and announcing the growing numbers of positive cases and fatalities.  Koch is the trusted civil servant on the frontline, every day defending the government’s coronavirus strategy, which entails a partial lockdown that relies on Swiss public spirit and individual responsibility to fight the virus. The strategy is not as strict as those in Italy and Spain, which have been particularly badly hit, or in neighbouring France and Austria. Koch’s calm demeanour has brought him praise in the German-speaking press.  “He’s an ascetic meditation guru who seems to be able to lower the collective pulse of the Swiss people to a bearable, healthy level,” said the Berner Zeitung.  The Luzerner Zeitung wrote: “Despite the dramatic nature of events, he doesn’t have any taste for blood, sweat or tears. He would never compare the virus to a war, as the French president did.” Koch’s long, eventful career has taught him how to stay calm during turbulent times.  “I have experienced many terrible things,” the 64-year-old doctor from canton Valais in southwestern Switzerland has said.  After completing his studies in medicine at Bern, Koch worked for 15 years for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). He became an ICRC medical coordinator and worked in Sierra Leone during the civil wars in 1991 and 2002.  “It was a particularly brutal war during which atrocities were committed. People had their hands cut off and child soldiers were instrumentalised,” he told newspaper Blick. He also carried out ICRC missions in Uganda, Rwanda, during the genocide in 1994, and South Africa.  Before becoming the face of the government’s response to coronavirus, Koch worked behind the scenes in the FOPH’s battles against the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 and bird flu.  “Having experience dealing with crises certainly helps you stay calm in this current situation,” he said recently.  Over the next few weeks or months, Koch will have to use his full experience and resources to manage this unprecedented crisis. He oversees a team of seven people who work day and night, seven days a week.  The crisis has meant the father of two has had no time for much else, like his hobby canicross, cross-country running with his two dogs.  “I sleep enough and I eat enough; I’ve always been thin,” he said recently to reassure about his pale and tired appearance. The pressure on the shoulders of Switzerland’s “Mr Coronavirus” is immense. While the media in German-speaking regions have praised his work, in French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland the strategy of the FOPH and the Swiss government has sparked criticism. There have been numerous calls for stricter confinement measures in French-speaking regions. Citizens even launched an online petition calling for a tougher line.  In Italian-speaking Ticino, which has been the worst-affected region, there have also been calls for strict isolation as in Italy. The Ascona government wrote to Koch saying some of his messages were unclear.  Switzerland’s strategy has also raised eyebrows abroad. In France, Haute-Savoie Senator Loïc Hervé urged his foreign minister to contact Switzerland to complain that the Swiss strategy was endangering the Ain and Haute-Savoie border regions, which are home to many cross-border workers. He called the Swiss approach “voluntarily lax” and a “dramatic incoherence”. The measures taken by the federal authorities in Bern have also revealed stark cultural differences across the country. While French- and Italian-speakers have called for tougher confinement measures, German-speakers appear happy with the rules imposed so far.  “In German culture, it is assumed that individual responsibility will lead to collective responsibility. This is a strange idea for cultures from southern Europe where order is supposed to come from above,” Swiss historian Olivier Meuwly told Le Temps.  In the face of criticism, Koch continues to explain tirelessly the government’s strategy. “We will perhaps toughen the measures a bit but the aim is not to impose total confinement,” he said.  “The measures that we are taking must match those of our culture, our society and democracy. We are not China and we don’t want to become a totalitarian regime.”  For the moment “Mr Coronavirus” seems to have reassured the Swiss public. In a recent public survey, 63% of respondents said they had confidence in the Swiss political leadership.  However, they were divided over the government’s coronavirus response: 54% of respondents agreed with the government’s current policy, while 42% wanted the authorities to limit personal freedom more strictly.  Will this be Koch’s swansong mission? The health official, who celebrates his 65th birthday on April 13, was due to retire, but he will probably have to put those plans on hold given the extent of the ongoing crisis and his key role.

2020-03-26;Novartis steps up coronavirus fight as part of new collaboration;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_novartis-steps-up-coronavirus-fight-as-part-of-new-collaboration/45644422;Several big pharmaceutical companies have joined forces with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to scale up solutions and support health systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, Basel-based pharmaceutical giant Novartis announced that CEO Vas Narasimhan would be the co-chair of a consortium of life science companies to speed up the development and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments for Covid-19 as well as other solutions. “We feel a deep shared responsibility to see if there are specific areas where collaboration across the life sciences industry and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation can accelerate solutions to this pandemic,” said Narasimhan in a statementExternal link. The consortium is intended to help ramp up solutions and tap the industry’s scientific knowledge and experience in delivering products at a scale of billions per day. As a first step, the 15 companies that are part of the consortium have agreed to share their proprietary libraries of molecular compounds with the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator launched by the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard two weeks ago. The accelerator will screen them for potential use against Covid-19 and if there are successful hits, the compounds would move rapidly into in vivo trials in as little as two months. Other companies that have teamed up in the consortium include GSK, Pfizer and Gilead. Gilead’s drug Remdesivir is an intravenous, antiviral medicine that is being studied in clinical trials as a treatment to Covid-19. Last week, Novartis announced it was donating up to 130 million doses of generic hydroxychloroquine, which along with a related drug, chloroquine, is currently under evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of Covid-19. The company has also created a Covid-19 Response FundExternal link providing $20 million (CHF 19 million) in grants to support public health initiatives for communities affected by the pandemic. Novartis is one of several big pharmaceutical companies that has moved out of the emerging infectious disease business. In 2014, the Swiss company sold its vaccine business to British pharma company GSK after operating at a loss for years. The company no longer has critical mass of expertise in virology, and no laboratories are working on antivirals or diagnostics.

2020-03-25;Swiss restrict exports of protective equipment as coronavirus hits;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-restrict-exports-of-protective-equipment-as-coronavirus-hits/45642960;Switzerland has introduced temporary restrictions on the export of protective equipment to head off shortages among medical staff and others fighting the coronavirus outbreak.  Licences will now be needed to export masks, gloves, goggles and swabs as of March 26, the government said on Wednesday.  Exceptions to the licensing requirement will apply to the European Union as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein as long as they treat Switzerland the same way, it added. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said the decision was in line with EU regulations. It is a precautionary measure and is not intended to create more problems, he said. It's the least we can do for the Swiss population to avoid a shortage of necessary medical equipment in an emergency situation. Parmelin confirmed that said deliveries of protective equipment to Switzerland were still blocked in France and Germany, despite a EU directive exempting the export of protective equipment to countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) from needing an export permit. There are apparently still administrative hurdles, he said at a news conference. Parmelin said he had spoken to an economics minister from an unspecified neighbouring country, pleading him to speed up procedures and show solidarity. Last weekend, Swiss hospitals agreed to take a number of coronavirus patients from France. Also on Wednesday, the Swiss government extended entry restrictions to all other 25 Schengen states. The measures previously applied to the neighbouring countries and Spain.   Citizens of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, people with a Swiss residence permit and people who have to travel to Switzerland for work-related reasons or because of an emergency will continue to be allowed to enter the country. Travellers may continue to transit through Switzerland and movements of goods are still permitted. In another development, the government also announced a raft of measures to cut red tape related to recruitment and short-time working to soften the impact of the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis. The measures are designed to make it easier to recruit medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural or logistics workers. We want to provide practical help and we are willing to adapt quickly if need be, he said. Last Friday, the government approved a financial package to the tune of CHF32 billion for the Swiss economy, notably for small and medium-sized businesses.

2020-03-25;Swiss companies to receive interest-free emergency loans;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/economic-measures_swiss-companies-to-receive-interest-free-emergency-loans/45643112;Switzerland has unveiled its “Covid-19 refinancing facility” (CRF), designed to provide cash-strapped companies with emergency loans to get through the coronavirus crisis. Loans of up to CHF500,000 ($510,000) will be interest free while firms will pay 0.5% on larger loans of up to CHF20 million. The facility will be up and running on Thursday, allowing companies to get access to cheap money to pay their immediate bills. All non-essential high street shops and services have been told to close their doors while some manufacturing activities have also been affected by the pandemic. Economists are warning of an inevitable recession as a result of the extraordinary measures. Last week, the government increased its emergency funding from CHF10 billion to CHF42 billion. Some CHF14 billion will pay the wages of employees on short-time work, with CHF20 billion being offered as guaranteed loans and more funds targeted at specific industries. The Swiss state will guarantee the entirety of loans of up to CHF500,000 and 85% of larger amounts, with commercial banks taking up the remaining 15% of risk. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will provide the cash that can be accessed by companies via an online application processExternal link. “Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF20 million,” the government statedExternal link. “Certain minimum criteria must be met. In particular, the company must declare that it is suffering substantial reductions in turnover because of the Covid-19 pandemic.”  The Swiss Business Federation welcomed the establishment of the loan facility, saying it would “prevent a negative chain reaction” of companies going bust. Credit Suisse issued a statement saying it does not want to earn income from this program. However, if this should be the case, we will donate any net profit generated to projects to support Swiss companies that are facing difficulties. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Ueli Maurer said he was confident that company owners would not abuse the cheap loan facility. But he warned of possible CHF100,000 fines for anyone who takes unfair advantage of the offer.  Maurer also said that further financial support will be contemplated for larger companies. The SNB has also recommended a temporary suspension of the countercyclical capital bufferExternal link that forces banks to set aside billions of francs against possible mortgage loan defaults. This is to allow banks to free up more capital to issue to the economy.  Credit Suisse bank issued a report on Wednesday that concluded that the “coronavirus crisis will not bring the Swiss property market to its knees”. This is largely because the government has vowed to cover a large portion of lost household earnings from the pandemic crisis. “While there will certainly be some damage, it will largely be confined to the commercial real estate segments, especially the market for retail space and the hotel industry,” the report stated.

2020-03-25;Switzerland extends border controls to all Schengen states;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_switzerland-extends-border-controls-to-all-schengen-states/45642706;The Swiss government has extended entry restrictions to all Schengen states. This will increase the protection given to the population against the coronavirus, it said on Wednesday.  Last week the Federal Council (executive body) imposed restrictions on entry by land and by air from Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Spain, and from all non-Schengen states.  “Since midnight, these stricter entry requirements have also applied to flights from all remaining Schengen statesExternal link with the exception of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The relevant authorities in the EU have been notified of the changes,” the government said in a statementExternal link.  With the extension of the stricter entry requirements to cover flights from all Schengen states and the checks being made on these entry requirements as part of border controls at airports, all flights from abroad are now subject to the same entry checks.  Citizens of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, people with a Swiss residence permit and people who have to travel to Switzerland for work-related reasons or because of an emergency will continue to be allowed to enter the country. Travellers may continue to transit through Switzerland and movements of goods are still permitted.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-25;Coronavirus: what is ‘essential’ in Switzerland?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus--what-is--essential--in-switzerland-/45642390;Switzerland has banned all non-essential activities to combat the spread of coronavirus. This provides an interesting opportunity for society to reflect on what is really important, says economist Sergio Rossi.  Shops, markets, restaurants, bars, museums, libraries, cinemas, concert halls, theatres, sports centres, swimming pools, hairdressers, beauty salons and ski resorts: from March 17 to April 19, all such businesses and facilities are closed in Switzerland. According to the authorities, these “non-essential” activities must be suspended during the pandemic to protect public health.  Only businesses providing essential goods to the population – such as grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, banks and post offices – are to remain open. If you put aside the economic consequences for employees and entrepreneurs, these measures are legitimate. How could a sports centre or theatre guarantee the health of visitors given the high risk of infection of the coronavirus? What is surprising, at first glance, is the list of activities that are still permitted and, implicitly, considered essential for society. While grocery stores and chemists undoubtedly need to stay open, it is more surprising to see takeaways, garages and newspaper kiosks on the list. These can remain open if they respect the government’s rules about hygiene and social distancing. Sergio Rossi, professor of economics at the University of Fribourg, External linkis also surprised by such differences.  “The definition of what is essential is subjective and depends on how human needs are classified, whether essential or voluntary,” he told swissinfo.ch. “Education is essential, but schools have been closed,” notes Rossi. “The current political choices primarily take into account people's physical health, turning a blind eye, for example, to kiosks and cigarettes. You could therefore argue that tobacco is an essential good, he added.  From an economic point of view the only truly essential activities are those that satisfy primary, vital needs, he goes on. Hence, food production, from the farmer to the retail store, and healthcare. In general, the definition of essential activities depends on how developed a society is over time and space, says Rossi.  “The current Swiss society is very different from that of a century ago. And it is not comparable with an African country, for example. With the advent of neoliberalism, the growth of the financial sector within the economy and globalization since the 1980s, essential needs have changed and are more numerous. Who could do without the internet?” he asks. When we reflect on what is really essential, we must also take into account the structure of society, he added. “There are young and old people, men and women, wealthy people and low-income classes. Healthcare is more important for the elderly, while education is more useful for children and young people. In a complex and evolving society, we need to find the right balance.”  When the Swiss government decided the coronavirus containment measures, these distinctions were not made, said Rossi.  “But rightly so, since the virus can affect everyone,” he said. The important thing is that society in general and each individual know what is really important, once the crisis has passed.  “This is the lesson we should draw from all this: to grasp what is really important and what is secondary in a person's life and in society as a whole.” As social creatures, he explains, we need each other. “This crisis also teaches us that the state is an essential socio-economic player. Society needs a strong state that is capable of responding to human needs at financial, health, cultural and relational levels,” says the Swiss economist.

While some people only need a laptop computer to continue to work, for others it’s a bit more complicated. Who said staying home was boring? If you’re creative enough – and have all the right equipment – you can turn your house into a gym. That’s what freestyle skier Andri Ragettli External linkdid in his home in Flims, canton Graubünden, in eastern Switzerland. The 21-year-old skier and seven times World Cup winner is used to sharing his crazy routine on social media. During the coronavirus epidemic, he has gone even further and launched an online appeal to fundraise for people affected by the virus. “For every like I get, I will donate 1 cent to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support the fight against Covid-19. We are in this together.” he wrote on Instagram. “Please don’t try this at home, it was only made to entertain you!” he added.

2020-03-25;How the Swiss food supply chain is coping with Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_how-the-swiss-food-supply-chain-is-coping-with-covid-19/45640386;"Running out of rice? Low on loo roll? In fact Switzerland has enough to last for months, but stockists are putting in serious overtime to meet the demand.  Like their peers in other parts of the world, shoppers in Switzerland began panic-buying in response to the threat of coronavirus. Images of empty shelves made the rounds on social media, with popular items selling out more quickly than the shops could replenish them – replenish being the key word.  “There is no reason to panic over food,” the government’s delegate for national economic supply, Werner Meier, told journalists last week. The Swiss Retail FederationExternal link took out a full-page newspaper ad assuring the public that there was no shortage of food, drinks, pet supplies or other necessities. It called on shoppers to be sensible: “Those who buy more than necessary may be leaving others empty-handed and our staff overworked – at a time that is already very challenging.”  So how are workers in retail coping with the extra demands of people who are now at home for every meal – some of them wary of extra trips to the grocery store or worried about self-quarantine?  At its main distribution warehouse, major supermarket chain Migros has added five extra shifts per week and is moving 10,000 pallets of wares on its busiest days; 5,500 would be the norm.  “The customers [were] practically unpacking the trucks for us. I’ve never experienced anything like it,” logistics manager Thomas Gasser told the weekly Migros customer magazine. “We have enough food – that wasn’t the problem.”  To compensate for the increase in demand, the central warehouse has been sending the stores at least a third more wares than they actually order to ward off bare shelves. Pasta, for example, needs to be restocked two to four times as often as usual. Retailers aren’t the only ones with ample supplies. Switzerland maintains emergency stockpiles of staples like flour, rice, sugar and oil. According to the Economic Supply Act, the nation must have enough to last for three to six months in the event of a crisis.  Switzerland produces about 60% of the food it needs to feed its population of 8.5 million. The rest is imported – for example, Italy and Spain are key partners for fruits and vegetables.  The supply chain here is still intact, according to Marcel Jampen of SwisscofelExternal link, the association for the Swiss fruit, vegetable and potato trade.  “There are in some cases too few trucks or longer waiting times to cross the Swiss border. And there are some shortages in terms of harvest workers,” said Jampen, who is the head of Swisscofel’s international fruit and vegetable department. “Despite the coronavirus crisis, domestic production and the import of everyday goods are secured,” states the Federal Office for National Economic SupplyExternal link on its website. It points out that thanks to the current reduction of imports from Asia, there’s more logistical capacity at European ports and for the onward delivery to Switzerland.  “Cross-border train traffic is currently operating without any issue. For road traffic, there are lines at some border crossings,” notes the office.  To make it easier for retailers to cope with the increased demand for essential goods, the supply office and the Federal Roads Office have temporarily relaxed the regulations on Sunday and night-time trucking and (un)loading.  But some workers in the industry don’t feel so relaxed.  “I get an uneasy feeling when drivers from Italy pick up or drop off goods. There are a lot of coronavirus cases there. I always keep a distance,” said Ali Cekcu, a forklift operator working for Migros.  Can the virus be transmitted via food?  “So far there are no known cases of the new coronavirus being transmitted via foodstuffs,” states the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link on its website. “If you want to be quite sure, wash and heat foods properly.”  You can contact the author of this article on Twitter: @SMisickaExternal link This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-24;Swiss divided over government response to coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion-poll_swiss-divided-over-government-response-to-coronavirus/45638798;Two out of five people in Switzerland are in favour of tighter restrictions by the government to stem the spread of the coronavirus, according to a nationwide survey.  Younger respondents and residents in the French-speaking part of the country are especially keen for the government to clamp down harder, an online poll has found.  As shown in the chart, 54% of respondents agree with the government’s current policy, while 42% want the authorities to limit personal freedom more strictly. The poll was carried out by the sotomo research instituteExternal link over the past weekend and published on Tuesday – ten days after the government began  imposing sweeping measures to shut down public life. The measures have included the closure of schools, restaurants and shops selling non-essential goods as well as a ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people, but no blanket curfew.  Perhaps not surprisingly, nearly 70% of respondents in the Italian-speaking region of Ticino – which borders Italy, a hotbed of the viral infection in Europe – said the government acted too late to curb the spread of the Covid-19 disease.  This figure is slightly lower (64%) in the French-language region, while a majority in the German-speaking region (56%) found the government acted just in time.  The survey also found that the government restrictions have had an impact on everyday life in Switzerland, although not all the urgent appeals were particularly well heeded.  “An overwhelming majority of respondents did not stay at home last week, but most of them said they had been in close contact with fewer than five people,” says Michael Hermann, director of Sotomo. Among the 65+ age group, which was particularly targeted by the government’s precautionary health measures, only about 25% adhered fully to the restrictions. See chart below for activities cited by respondents from all age groups to go outdoors. “The crisis appears to have had a particularly negative impact on the younger generations,” says Hermann. He also said that only a very small minority of the 30,000 respondents are confident that life in Switzerland will go back to normal before the summer.  At the moment, an absolute majority assumes the coronavirus disease will affect their personal health mildly. Only a small percentage are afraid of as a result of Covid-19. See chart for further details. People aged between 15 and 44 are more pessimistic than the older generation about whether Swiss hospitals will be able to cope with an  expected increase in patient numbers,  or whether they will face a situation like that seen in northern Italy.  Respondents in the French- and Italian-language regions are more pessimistic on this front than their fellow citizens in the main German-speaking region, the pollsters found. The wide-ranging attitudinal survey on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation also polled people’s trust in the government.  As shown in the chart below, more than 60% of respondents give the authorities a good score card. But the divide between the language regions is striking, the Sotomo report points out.  Again, respondents in German-speaking Switzerland trust the government more than their fellow citizens in the other language regions.

2020-03-24;Switzerland is finding strength through kindness amid Covid-19;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_switzerland-is-finding-strength-through-kindness-amid-covid-19/45640316;"During a global pandemic, Switzerland's residents are finding innovative ways to support each other.  It started to catch my attention two weeks ago, when I drove hundreds of bottles of donated hand soap to refugees living in a Zurich camp. Though mothers at my kids' private, international school feared how the virus might affect their lives, they still raced to a store to buy products for refugees, met me in a rainy carpark, and shared soap with the less fortunate. Within two days of notifying my community of the need, I had a car overflowing with soap. Since then, I've seen mothers offering to share food, board games, puzzles, tutors, and activity ideas during a lockdown. Others promote small businesses they're concerned about on chats and offer their time and resources to strangers on social media pages. This morning I asked my neighbor Noina, Are you afraid? as all sorts of people come to her restaurant at scheduled times, reach under her new plastic shield and pick up the Thai food she's hygienically prepared in her vacant kitchen. We stood far apart in our parking area as she explained to me that she loves her work, more than ever. “People who serve the sick need someone to cook for them. They're stressed and tired. It makes me feel good to help. Noina, a Swiss Thai Buddhist, texts me, an American expat Christian, every morning – just to see how my family feels. She tells me she's praying for us.  It seems that countless people like Noina live in Switzerland, wanting to cope with the pandemic with kindness. In the past week I've read how Switzerland's people have taken to sharing services, masks and phone numbers; singing, playing instruments and clapping out balconies and windows; organizing social media channels; caring for the elderly and immune-compromised – all proving that though social distancing and hand washing are critical, acts of kindness build strength for surviving a global pandemic.  It's no surprise that research out of Oxford University supportsExternal link the phenomenon that acts of kindness directly impact human happiness and overall wellbeing. Another study, conducted by Harvard University, documented The Mother Teresa EffectExternal link whereby even the simple act of witnessing kind acts can strengthen the immune system. These are just some of the countless acts of kindness that have brightened the landscape recently in Switzerland:  Social media has transformed into a force for good. Facebook groups and strings within established groups have been created, for most localities, to help others. Many are charted here.  Swiss techies have rapidly created websites to provide volunteer opportunities and assistance to those in need of help. For example, support.inzuri.chExternal link offers an entire section dedicated to helping with pets, shopping, sharing resources, mental health, kids’ health and giving assistance if the coronavirus is contracted. And, hilfe-jetzt.chExternal link (not yet available in English) was created to help people organize themselves into service groups and find help. The site includes a search engine for finding nearby resources and groups to join across Switzerland. The Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland has created a page with extensive informationExternal link on how to access all forms of assistance and answers to questions relating to the coronavirus.  Churches across Switzerland such as C3 ZurichExternal link and allsouls.chExternal link have created Livestream services, also called social distance services that include song, prayer, chats, and online sermons.  Free online meditation services have been offered by many practitioners to help calm coronavirus anxiety. Some include treeoflifeguru.comExternal link, ofthisspace.com and lhagsam.chExternal link. The hashtag #dieschweizsagtDANKEExternal link via Instagram and Twitter notes times when the public will clap from balconies and out windows for healthcare workers across Switzerland. In Geneva, people applaud from balconies every evening at 9pm, and a major national round of applause took place last week. Other random acts of kindness reported throughout Switzerland include singing and playing live music from windows and balconies, offering to drive supplies from one city to the next, blood donations, free bouquets of flowers distributed from markets that are no longer to permitted to sell them, and checking on friends and neighbors via instant messaging. Businesses are working to create products to help people cope. Many start-up companiesExternal link have created or adjusted products in response to the coronavirus with bracelets to track health changes, people-counting systems for supermarkets, flexible worker options, social distancing calculators and other innovations. Swiss watchmakers are dropping their work to make much-needed hospital ventilator parts. In Bern, a distiller of gin started making hand sanitizer. If you or your business haven't yet found time to find ways to help others, consider joining the emerging stay strong by acting kind culture amid the coronavirus. It's growing in Switzerland, as fast as the wildflowers.  Do you have a service or act of kindness to note, in Switzerland or wherever you live? Let us know in the comments.

2020-03-24;Swiss artists keep up morale despite devastating pandemic;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-artists-keep-up-morale-despite-devastating-pandemic/45639948;Cancelled festivals, closed museums, theatres and cinemas – the arts world has been crippled by the coronavirus. Four leading names of the Swiss cultural scene explain the impact of the pandemic on the institutions they run and on social life in general.  A concert hall is not a bank. A festival doesn’t operate like a multinational corporation – it sometimes relies on volunteers for its logistical requirements. Some cultural events live solely on their takings, without any financial aid from their city or municipality. So when there is no audience it is therefore fatal.  This highlights the fragility of a sector which has been on the ropes since the beginning of March and especially after the government announced emergency measures such as banning gatherings of initially more than 50 people and then five. Nevertheless, despite the current despair, faith in the future remains.  Nicolas Stemann, artistic director of the Schauspielhaus Zurich Theatre works on the principle of sharing. A play can’t be performed without the physical presence of the audience. So what I miss is that co-existence, which is the foundation of every society, of which we are deprived at the moment. The Schauspielhaus will be closed until April 30. The financial losses are dramatic. How high are they? I don’t know yet. I can, however, measure the moral loss.  One of the programmes planned for March was Das Weinen (Crying), a play by Dieter Roth, directed by Christoph Marthaler from Zurich. The subject is isolation and it’s set in a pharmacy. So the show finds itself transplanted directly onto the current health situation. It’s a coincidence, but it makes me think that Marthaler is a visionary. I’m very sad not to be able to put on the play now. But I tell myself that out of something bad some good will come: after the crisis, the public will without doubt be more aware of the vital role of theatre in society.  Thierry Jobin, director of the Fribourg International Film Festival The 34th edition of the festival, which should have opened on March 20, has been cancelled. We replaced it at the last minute with a shortened format, spread over the rest of the year. It’s better than nothing, but we’re still incurring heavy financial losses. The event was the first to be affected by the coronavirus, and I hope it won’t be the last sector the state thinks about when life resumes.  Having said that, it took this crisis to realise how valuable the harmony of an event is. A festival is like a menu whose different dishes have to be synchronised. We’ll now probably eat the starter in December, and the meat won’t be accompanied by crunchy vegetables. And since we’re talking about cooking, I’ll add that we’ll be keeping nice and warm one of the festival’s sections, “New Territory”, devoted in particular to Asian and African cinema.  I hope to roll it out in autumn. Under no circumstance would I want to fail one of our missions: to introduce the audience to filmmakers from countries supported by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). The pandemic has taught me that culture is essential to democratic ideals.  Vincent Baudriller, director of the Théâtre de Vidy, Lausanne The sudden interruption of the season has been violent – in short, it’s a break with society. What a theatre offers is the opposite of what this pandemic is producing, namely cutting social ties. The health crisis highlights how dysfunctional our world is. Its magnitude will have an impact on the imagination of artists in the coming months.  I know playwrights who are already working on this subject. Crises should serve as an indicator to rectify ways of thinking and acting. When the theatre reopens, we’ll certainly adopt new practices. There will be many aspects to deal with, including the financial issue. Like everyone else, we’re recording heavy losses. Direct losses with all the income generated by our shows, both at Vidy and on tour abroad. And the indirect ones with creative projects for the next three or four years. What will it be like? We’ll see what happens. Right now, our computers are whirring away nonstop.  Guillaume Potterat, co-director of the Cully Jazz Festival, Vaud  Unlike the cancelled film festivals, ours won’t be reborn this year in a different format. The concerts we schedule are not streamed like films or made as podcasts – those media don’t correspond to our values and even less to the demands of our audience. So there you have it, for us the pain is financial – all the more so as the state subsidy allocated to us is very low.  However, this crisis has made us discover a beautiful thing: solidarity. The people of the region have been very generous towards us. Many of our audience members didn’t want to get their tickets refunded. Others have donated a total of CHF30,000 ($30,700). In future, the municipality will certainly help us. Let’s just say that we’re confident of resuming the festival next year. Switzerland is a rich country, its culture is not going to stop because of a virus.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-24;Global curbs on medical exports imperil poor nations;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_curbs-on-medical-exports-imperil-poor-nations/45639804;"Around 50 countries have introduced curbs on exports of medical supplies, including ventilators. This poses a major risk for poor countries, a Swiss study has revealed.  The past fortnight has seen nations around the world scrambling for medical supplies and equipment to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus. A growing number of governments have adopted measures to curb exports of such material to ensure adequate national supplies.  As of March 21, 46 export curbs on medical supplies have been introduced by 54 governments since the beginning of the year. Thirty-three of those export curbs have been announced since the beginning of this month, a trade policy report External linkby the University of St Gallen shows. Ventilators are of particular concern, said study author Simon J. Everett. These are essential instruments for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe Covid-19. Currently, out of the 25 nations that export medical ventilators, only one is from Latin America, while there are none in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Asia. It is unlikely that local manufacturers in these countries will be able to step in to meet demand. “As several of the exporters of medical ventilators are members of the European Union, where an export authorisation-cum-ban is now in effect, then half of the producers of ventilators are already beyond reach of buyers in emerging markets,” Everett warned. “Working together, governments could quickly and cheaply implement a tariff-and-aid initiative that sweeps away the barriers which impede medical supplies reaching locations where there are desperately needed.”  The global ventilators market is worth more than $1 billion (CHF975 million) annually, according to Swiss-based Hamilton Medical, which says it has roughly a quarter share of revenue. Other major ventilator makers include US-based ResMed, Getinge of Sweden, Germany’s Draegerwerk and China’s Beijing Aeonmed. One of the world’s largest makers of ventilators, Hamilton Medical expects to increase production to about 21,000 ventilators this year, up from 15,000 last year by deploying marketing staff on the production line, among other measures. But with many more orders than it can fulfil, the company faces difficult decisions on where to send them. In Switzerland, the pressure on the health system is growing. Hospitals in Switzerland have to report how many emergency beds are available. In Switzerland there are 82 intensive care units, which have a total of 950-1,000 beds; around 850 of the beds are equipped with ventilators. The army has around 100 additional ventilators and has put in an order for 900 more. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-24;Japan and IOC agree to one-year delay to Tokyo 2020 Games;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-impact_swiss-olympic-says-tokyo-2020-games-should-be-postponed/45638702;Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he and International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach have agreed to delay the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games by about one year. Switzerland had previously called for the event to be postponed.  Abe, who spoke to Bach on Tuesday amid growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, said Japan would hold the Games by the summer of 2021 at the latest. Japan had completed preparations for this summer’s competitions when the virus started spreading. In the past few days, various sporting organisations and individuals had called for the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed owing to the coronavirus pandemic, including Switzerland’s top sporting body.  Swiss Olympic wrote to the Lausanne-based IOC at the weekend asking to put the event on hold until the pandemic was under control worldwide.  “Under these conditions, we do not believe that a fair, global Olympic Games in the sense of the Olympic movement are possible. That is why we applied to the IOC for a postponement,” Swiss Olympic President Jürg Stahl said in a statementExternal link. “Athletes are suffering from difficult training conditions. Moreover, the first countries have now cancelled their participation in the Olympics,” he said. “The Olympic Games send a sign of hope, confidence and joie de vivre – but only if they can be experienced safely and peacefully by all athletes from all countries, by volunteers, officials and the public.”   Abe said on Tuesday he had asked the IOC “to consider postponement of about one year to make it possible for athletes to play in the best condition, and to make the event a safe and secure one for spectators”. He said Bach had agreed “100%”. Australia and Canada withdrew from the Games on Monday and the United States added its weight to other calls for the Tokyo Games to be postponed.  The coronavirus pandemic has now infected more than 377,000 people across 194 countries and territories as of Tuesday morning, according to a Reuters tally, with over 16,500 deaths linked to the virus.

2020-03-24;Zurich uni offers free couples therapy during corona crisis;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_zurich-uni-offers-free-couples-therapy-during-corona-crisis/45639470;"With many couples suddenly finding themselves in close confinement due to coronavirus distancing measures, tensions are inevitable. The University of Zurich is now offering free online counselling. The goal of the programmeExternal link is to help relationships become stronger in times of stress by increasing mutual support, the University wroteExternal link on Tuesday. The main focus of the counselling is on boosting effective communication, which often falls victim in stressful times. It also aims to teach participants that the value of a solid partnership lies not merely in the relationship itself, but also in the general health and well-being benefits it brings, the university writes. Being in a satisfying and loving relationship leads to a better overall mood, as well as better psychological and even physical health. “A ‘healthy’ partnership is objectively linked to having a stronger immune system and a lower risk of sickness.” Initially, a five-hour introduction offers videos, examples, and practical lessons about how to better solve shared problems and challenges; for those who need more targeted advice, one-on-one counselling can be booked from this week. The offer is directly linked to the social isolation measures around the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen people in Switzerland forbidden from congregating in groups of more than five people, and strongly advised by the government to stay at home. Authorities have so far stopped short of a complete lockdown.  Those who are able to do their jobs from home, meanwhile, have been advised to do so. ​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-24;Authorities rule out lockdown of Verbier;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_authorities-rule-out-lockdown-of-verbier/45639042;Swiss authorities have rejected calls by doctors in Verbier to impose a strict confinement on the chic mountain resort, despite concerns over a surge in local coronavirus cases.  Doctors had reported a cluster of 60 infected people in the municipality of Val de Bagnes in canton Valais, which includes Verbier, although the figures are thought to be much higher. They called for the town to be confined and contacted the federal government for guidance.  On Monday, the Valais cantonal authorities released a statement External linksaying it had decided to rule out confinement, in accordance with the Swiss government. This followed talks with the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and Val de Bagnes local authorities.  However, the canton ordered the commune to close public squares and playgrounds, as well as jacuzzis and spas in hotels, and to increase police patrols. It reiterated the current ban on public and private gatherings of more than five people.  “Several areas of epidemic exist in our country. Isolating them is not a solution to limit the spread of the disease,” it said, while urging the local population to remain at home “as much as possible”.  As of March 23, Switzerland has reported almost 9,000 positive coronavirus cases – of which 500 are in canton Valais – and 86 deaths. The government ordered the closure of all ski resorts and lifts on March 13, but Verbier, which is a popular town in the Alps for both tourists and locals, remained busy up until recently. There are around 8,000 permanent residents registered in the chic sprawling mountain town, but during the busy winter season the number of inhabitants rises to 35,000. As the coronavirus epidemic has spread in Switzerland, some have chosen to stay in their second homes in the mountains, a practice that is still allowed. Almost 60% of chalets and apartments in Val de Bagnes are second homes. Local doctor Sabine Popescu told Swiss public radio, RTS, that people had been travelling to Verbier during the epidemic believing that the mountain resort was somehow safer. “Very soon there will be no more tests or medicines to treat people and the only way is to halt the rise,” she said.  Dr. Hicham El Ghaoui estimated that 60% of the local population was infected. He told Reuters that the first cases were probably imported by people from Milan who came to Verbier after the Italian city was placed under lockdown last month. Popescu thought the virus had been spread by young, asymptomatic partygoers in the resort’s bars and clubs. “How could all these young people who came to party in Verbier imagine they were vectors?” she said.  Quarantining a whole region is not allowed in Switzerland. Martin Dumermuth, director of the Federal Office of Justice, told reporters in Bern on Monday that cantons do not have the legal competence to close off whole areas, such as Verbier.  However, this has happened in other European ski resorts and regions, such as Bansko in Bulgaria, Ischgl and St Anton in the Arlberg region in Austria, and Heiligenblut in Carinthia (Austria).

2020-03-24;Pandemic rattles already vulnerable antibiotics market;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_pandemic-rattles-already-vulnerable-antibiotics-market/45636702;As money is poured into the search for a silver bullet to Covid-19, some global health experts warn that the pandemic could also worsen the slow-burning crisis in the antibiotics market, complicating patient care. One of the early studiesExternal link of Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, found that some patients, especially severely ill ones, had secondary bacterial infections. Antibiotics were administered but the study writes that high drug resistance rates to certain bacteria, such as Gram-negativeExternal link, raise the risk of septic shock. While antibiotics won’t treat viruses like Covid-19, they are an important line of defense against secondary bacterial infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections and sepsis that are more common with prolonged stays in intensive care units, particularly among people with weak immune systems. However, there has been very little talk about antibiotics. “We don’t have a line of sight into the supply and demand of antibiotics right now. We don’t know what antibiotics are being used to treat coronavirus patients and where there are problems,” says Manica Balasegaram, a medical doctor who heads the Geneva-based Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDPExternal link), which focuses on vulnerable groups, hardest hit by Covid-19. “In outbreaks you still need essential medicines like antibiotics,” Balasegaram told swissinfo.ch. Hospital infections will increase because of the complicated, chaotic situation as more people are being put on respiratory devices and medical staff don’t have time to change gloves between patients. This wouldn’t be a major concern if it wasn’t that the antibiotics market is already suffering from years of neglect. Shortages and drug resistance are on the rise according to the World Health Organisation, which estimates that drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deathsExternal link each year by 2050. A reportExternal link from the biopharmaceutical industry published earlier this year found that 47% of the 65 responding companies experienced product supply chain disruptions of antibiotics. With more countries shutting borders, trade restrictions in India and manufacturing disruptions in China, there are growing concerns that meeting rising demand could prove even more difficult. Enea Martinelli, head pharmacist at the FMI hospital in Interlaken told swissinfo.ch that hospitals in Switzerland are getting organised and that supply isn’t a problem now. But he worries about what’s ahead in a few months’ time. “This [pandemic] will have an impact on drug supply, but we don’t know which drugs yet,” says Martinelli. Sandoz, a division of Novartis, and the largest generic antibiotic manufacturer in the world, told swissinfo.ch that it does not anticipate supply chain disruption for the majority of its portfolio at this time given strong mitigation measures and inventory levels. However, the situation is very dynamic and there are aspects that are beyond any one manufacturer’s control. In late February, the company announced that it would keep prices stableExternal link for essential medicines, despite current uncertainties. ExpertsExternal link have been warning for years that the antibiotics market is in peril. Antibiotics are one of the oldest medicines but overuse and misuse over the years led bacteria to build up defenses against them. This has led to an urgent need for new antibiotics. Marc Gitzinger, the CEO of Swiss biotech start-up Bioversys, says it worked “to offer antibiotics at a low price because of the high volume but this has changed tremendously.” Doctors have become more careful about prescribing antibiotics, only in cases where it is necessary. Bioversys is working on an antibiotic to fight highly resistant Gram-negative bacterial infectionsExternal link in hospitals that have a mortality rate of 50%. It was intended to enter clinical trials later this year but Gitzinger fears that it will be put on the back burner as the EU and US drug approval bodies are absorbed in containing the coronavirus. As more drugs go off-patent, their demand in emerging economies has risen and prices have dropped. This has led many companies to move out of the market because it isn’t profitable. An evaluation of 30 companiesExternal link found that R&D for antibiotics is becoming increasingly concentrated among a few companies. During the World Economic Forum in Davos, Jay Iyer who heads the Access to Medicines Foundation cautioned that “we are relying on very few companies to hold the world supply of antibiotics in check.”   Several big pharmaceutical companies including Novartis and Allergan announced recently that they were moving out of novel antibiotic research and two antibiotic start-ups went belly-up last year. Roche, the other big Basel-based pharmaceutical giant, pulled out of antibiotics in the 1990s but has been rebuilding its expertise in the area. “We have always warned that this could be a problem,” says Martinelli. As Martinelli saw more production become more concentrated in Asia, he started the website drugshortage.chExternal link four years ago to track more frequent shortages of drugs, some of which are antibiotics. Four years ago, some 100 packages had shortages, now there are over 700. This is unrelated to Covid-19. Around 70-80% of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), some of which is for antibiotics, in Switzerland come from Asia, where production is cheaper. This reliance on fewer production sites, farther outside of Europe means that problems at one factory can lead to major bottlenecks. When Chinese factory closures due to the outbreak slowed drug production in India, the Indian government ordered export bans on twenty-six pharmaceutical productsExternal link, including some antibiotics. “Companies have traditionally stocks between two to six months. They are able to deal with short term disruptions. The problem is if countries start stockpiling – tripling demand because they are in a panic and more impose trade restrictions. This could do more harm than good,” says Thomas Cueni, the Director General of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations. Sandoz’s factory in Kundl, Austria is the only antibiotic manufacturing plant left in Europe, which the company says makes it less exposed to disruptions than others. Martinelli says that he’s been in discussions with several industry managers and believes they are really stepping up to help in the crisis. Various governments and foundations have ramped up investment in antibiotics R&D over the last few years, but even with an influx of investment, experts argue the economic model is broken. “It is impossible to have a sustainable market when you are not allowed to sell at a decent price,” Gitzinger says, illustrating his point by saying a sweet in an exclusive chocolate shop in Zurich is more expensive than amoxicillin, an antibiotic used to treat critically ill patients. It is hard to get investors on board when there is no return, he adds, which is why most of the drug development companies have less than 100 employees.  “We have an urgent situation and very few experts left that can develop antibacterial drugs. If we don't change things and don't get investment back into the field, we will lose more talent.” Balasegaram from GARDP agrees that there is a need for a new model. “If we leave it to the market, we are in trouble. We need companies like Sandoz to stay in the business. If we aren’t invested in public health research, we will run into problems like this again and again.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;Bouncing back from a coronavirus infection, a Swiss testimony;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bouncing-back-from-a-coronavirus-infection--a-swiss-testimony/45637004;With the number of fatalities caused by the coronavirus rising exponentially, it is easy to overlook the number of people who have recovered. To date more than 98,000 people have overcome the virus. It's assumed they are now immune. One of them is Bettina Sooder. She was the third person officially diagnosed with Covid-19 in Zurich. It was a strange feeling because suddenly you are a danger to others. You also feel lonely, she says. The 26-year-old probably got infected in Italy, during Milan’s famous Fashion Week. On her return, a colleague advised her to take a coronavirus test. The first case in Switzerland had only been identified the day before.  She remained in isolation at the Zurich University Hospital for four days. Then she continued her quarantine at home for another then days.  Sooder got a call from the doctor every day and after being free of symptoms for 48 hours, she was declared recovered and able to work again. Still, many didn't want to get too close to her yet. You get a little stigmatised. And people are already avoiding me because they are afraid of being infected, and I understand that. Sooder works as a doctor's secretary in a fertility clinic in Zurich. But now she makes the most of her immunity and takes blood from the patients. As a trained health worker, she’d like to offer her services to a hospital should her current place of work shut down. Marcel Salathé, Head of the Digital Epidemiology Lab at Lausanne Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), says that recovered people will soon play a very important role: Not just for the health system, but for the overall system. Those who are immune will no longer be affected by the virus.   According to Salathé, they could bring the entire health system back into action. They can take over important positions from those who are infected or are at risk of getting infected,” he says. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;How social distancing is taking hold in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-explainer_how-social-distancing-is-taking-hold-in-switzerland/45625540;"What began as a recommendation to avoid handshakes and kisses on cheeks has now turned into a measure urging residents to stay at home as much as possible. As the country combats the novel coronavirus outbreak, its more than 8 million residents are gradually coming to terms with restrictive new social norms.  The latest social distancing measures imposed by the government are meant to reduce the number of contacts between individuals dramatically and thus slow the spread of the virus. The government in Bern, like many other countries around the world, has asked residents to stay at home as much as possible and avoid unnecessary contact with others.  While the rogue handshake will likely be brushed off, a new regulation that entered into force on March 16 foresees strict punishment for violations of the ban on large gatherings of up to three years’ imprisonment, although fines are much more likely.  Social distancing could break the exponential spread of the virus in the population and prevent a collapse of the healthcare system. According to Alain Berset, the country’s interior minister responsible for health matters, social distancing “is the best way to slow the spread of the virus.” Yes, but they are advised to do so only if they have to go to work, do groceries, see the doctor, walk the dog or help another person. People aged 65 or older should not be going to the supermarket and instead should seek help with grocery shopping, the head of infectious diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health, Daniel Koch, said at a press conference. Going out for some fresh air is also possible, so long as people go on their own or with family members from the same household, Koch told Swiss public broadcaster SRF. In many ways, there are just fewer reasons to leave home. All restaurants, bars, museums, cinemas, ski pistes, swimming pools and businesses that require close contact between personnel and customers – hair salons, for example – are to remain closed until April 19. Schools are also closed.  Businesses have been instructed to allow their staff to work from home if that is possible. Struggling companies can ask the government for permission to give their staff part-time unemployment benefits.  Neighbouring countries have much stricter rules curbing social interactions. In France, residents need to be able to show a document that attests to their reasons for leaving their homes.  Italians are only allowed to go shopping individually. There, police can send people back home if they’re not convinced that the reason for leaving it is reasonable.  Yes, but all unnecessary social contact must be avoided. The government has banned all public and private events. It has also banned gatherings of five people or more in public places until April 19. Those who violate this ban face fines of CHF100 (around $101). Cities like Bern and Zurich have closed off some public spaces, such as parks, to discourage people from congregating. However, it’s still possible to invite a few friends over for dinner, the public health office saysExternal link on its website, so long as everyone keeps a distance of two metres and follows good hygiene (washing hands thoroughly and coughing into the elbow). But it advises against private parties, including invitations to children’s birthday celebrations.  With schools closed, children looking for playmates can meet in small groups of up to five kids. The government has asked crèches or alternative childcare facilities to remain open, but these are also bound to follow the same guidelines on group sizes.  Playgrounds and parks remain open, unlike in other countries, although some municipalities have closed theirs. Organised playgroups are not allowed and parents must keep their distance from each other. The elderly and those with certain medical conditions have been told to avoid all contact with children.   Outings to restaurants and cafes are no longer possible because they've been ordered closed at least until April. Hotels have been ordered to drastically reduce the number of guests, who are nevertheless allowed to frequent hotel restaurants.  The ban on larger gatherings is being increasingly enforced by police. Associations and sports teams can no longer convene. Yes, although the general advice from public health authorities is to avoid it if possible, since travelling on buses and trains can prevent riders from keeping physical distance between each other.  The Federal Office of Public Health is encouraging people to walk or bicycle to work instead. National train services and several local transport networks have been significantly reduced.  Those 65 or older and people showing flu-like symptoms must avoid public transport altogether.  The aim [is] to stop any event where larger groups of people gather in enclosed settings at relatively high density, writes Benjamin J. Cowling, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, who co-authored an upcoming paperExternal link on the effectiveness of social distancing during influenza pandemics. If people end up interacting closely with five people instead of the usual ten on a typical day – on public transport, at the office or in a restaurant – then it should have a big effect in reducing the opportunities for transmission to occur, Cowling explains to swissinfo.ch. Cowling and his co-authors argue that authorities deploy social distancing measures with three goals in mind: delay the peak of infections so they can prepare the healthcare system to cope with severe cases; reduce the size of the peak; and spread infections over a more extended period, to allow better management of cases and potential use of vaccines later in the epidemic. Social distancing, however, “may not have much effect on transmission unless they lead to major changes in behaviour,” Cowling warns. A new reportExternal link from Imperial College London suggests that if social distancing is applied to the entire population in combination with other measures, like isolation of the infected and school closures, then it has the potential to rapidly reduce the number of new cases. Across the country, shops that can stay open are gradually taking measures to limit the number of customers. Posters and announcements call on shoppers and commuters to keep a safe distance from each other. Cordons have even been set up at the front of buses and trams to maintain distance between drivers and passengers. The Federal Council imposed fines and imprisonment of up to three years for violations of its set of measures to curb the spread of the virus. Police in several cantons have already issued fines for violations of the ban on public gatherings of more than five people. The city of Geneva alone handed out over 30 fines during the weekend the ban took effect, public broadcaster RTS reported.  The military is assisting the police in the enforcement, but Viola Amherd, the minister of defence, stressed that troops are performing a supporting role to law enforcement.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;Switzerland begins historic repatriation effort over coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/homecoming_switzerland-begins--historic--repatriation-effort-over-coronavirus/45636648; With three flights for stranded Swiss tourists in South America scheduled this week and others planned to bring back the thousands who remain stuck abroad, the foreign ministry is mounting the ‘biggest organised return’ in the country’s history. At a press conference in Bern on Monday, Hans-Peter Lenz of the foreign ministry confirmed the flights the foreign ministry had organised to bring home travellers from Peru, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Flights from all continents are being organised. “We will continue to increase the rhythm of these flights,” Lenz said, adding that the operation could represent the ‘biggest repatriation action’ in the country’s recent history. Some 15,000 registered Swiss travellers are currently abroad, many of them in “remote” locations, according to Lenz. The government has called on all travellers to come home as soon as possible due to global disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The foreign ministry, meanwhile, has asked travellers to register with the Travel Admin AppExternal link, where they can submit their name, contact number, and place of stay. An additional about 7,500 registered citizens over the weekend, Lenz said. Asked about the priority that will be given to the people allowed on board such flights, Lenz said that Swiss travellers will be given first priority, followed by Swiss citizens living abroad, then citizens of ‘neighbouring countries’, and finally citizens of European countries. Some 750 people will be brought back to Switzerland on the chartered flights from Lima, Bogota, and San José over the coming days. They must then go into self-imposed quarantine for ten days.

2020-03-23;Fraud and online crime on the rise in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/annual-stats_fraud-and-online-crime-on-the-rise-in-switzerland/45636712;While ‘hard’ crimes such as murder remain rare, and numbers of thefts are dropping, fraud and online crimes relating to pornography continued to rise in Switzerland in 2019. The total number of infractions of the penal code fell in 2019 for the seventh consecutive year, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO)External link announced on Monday. Some 432,000 cases were recorded, a drop of 0.2%. This included 36,419 house burglaries, a drop of 50% compared to the record year of 2012. Forty-six murders were reported, of which 29 were related to domestic violence – slightly above the 10-year average of 25. Police documented 679 rapes, 53 more than in 2018. Cases of fraud jumped by 8%, continuing a trend which has seen such crimes more than double in a decade. This may be linked to a larger rise in online criminality, the FSO reckons, though it adds that it needs more statistics before drawing conclusions. A total of 17,606 cases of fraud were reported last year. The Conference of Cantonal Police Commanders of Switzerland (CCPCS), the body providing coordination between the regional police forces, said on Monday that it was working to boost “networking” between different cantonal forces to tackle online crime. Examples of such infractions include the fraudulent misuse of a computer (5,583 cases in 2019, a rise of 598 relative to 2018) and pornography-related offenses (2,387 cases, a jump of over 50%). Also on Monday, the Zurich police warnedExternal link against increasing fraud in relation to the coronavirus shutdown in the country. Older people in particular should be wary of people calling to their door and offering to purchase groceries, or to disinfect their apartment. Though acts of solidarity are indeed common in recent weeks, some of these offers are by hucksters, the police said. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;Switzerland faces recession in 2020 due to pandemic, experts warn;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_switzerland-faces-recession-in-2020-due-to-pandemic--experts-warn/45636494;Switzerland is headed towards a severe recession this year due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus, experts warn. If the pandemic is brought under control, the Swiss economy should rebound strongly in 2021. The BAK Economics Institute, a Basel-based think tank, says the collapse of private spending will trigger a global recession. For Switzerland, this means reduced service exports due to a drop in demand for tourism and events. On Monday, the think tank predicted a fall in gross domestic product of 2.5% in 2020. That contrasts with its previous forecast which estimated a growth of 1.3% for this year. In an optimistic scenario where the health crisis is quickly under control, the economy should rebound strongly by 4.3% in 2021. Reduced economic growth will also likely take a toll on employment. The unemployment rate in Switzerland is expected to rise by 0.8 percentage points to 3.1% in 2020, before declining again to 2.7% in 2021. In a separate forecast, specialists from the UBS bank said they expect a GDP drop of 1.3% this year followed by a rebound of 2% in 2021, provided emergency measures are abandoned at the end of April. If the crisis continues beyond then, GDP growth could fall by 3% in 2020, they warned. In this negative scenario, the unemployment rate would increase and weigh on household spending. A wave of corporate bankruptcies would mean defaults on loans from banks. The latter would reduce the volume of mortgages, which would penalise the construction sector. In this case, an economic rebound would not occur before 2022.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;Why homework won’t disappear after home studying ends;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/education_why-homework-won-t-disappear-after-home-studying-ends/45627922;The term homework has taken on a whole new meaning with the closure of Swiss schools due to the coronavirus outbreak. But when distance learning, as it’s better known, comes to an end, some Swiss schools will reopen the debate on the importance of homework. Before the health crisis began to wreak havoc, a primary school in eastern Switzerland had become the latest to experiment with stopping homework for its pupils. The one-year pilot project, at the Feldli-Schoren primary school near St Gallen, concerned pupils aged around eight to 12. “Our main aim here is equal opportunities: there are big gaps between educationally disadvantaged and educationally advantaged families. Homework is a stress for those who can’t ask their parents for advice or help,” headteacher Ralf Schäpper told the newspaper the St Galler TagblattExternal link, in February, after it was announced the scheme was being extended from its initial six months. The move benefits everyone though. “When children come home from school, after seven lessons, they shouldn’t have to sit back at their desks again,” Schäpper said. Instead, there are now four weekly extra supervised learning times at school, each lasting 20-30 minutes. The first feedback has been “mostly positive” among pupils, teachers and parents, according to Schäpper (although he admits some parents preferred the old system as they like to know what their kids are doing at school). The Feldli-Schoren school is not alone. A primary school in KriensExternal link near Lucerne, and several in the Bern region have also abolished homework in recent years.  The topic however remains controversialExternal link. Bernhard HauserExternal link, professor of early childhood studies, at the St Gallen University of Teacher Education, says there are several reasons why. “Many children and parents are only too pleased when there is no homework because it means fewer tensions at home,” he told swissinfo.ch. “But international learning research results show that homework is one of the many contributions that ensures that schools work well and that the learning benefit is high.” “There are of course parents who complain when there is no homework, so it’s also controversial among parents,” Hauser said. These parents feel homework is important for their children’s school performance and later careers. Education is the responsibly of the cantons in Switzerland, but much is decided on the local school level. Homework is not obligatoryExternal link. The Lehrplan 21 (Curriculum 21)External link for German-speaking Switzerland, for example, only says when homework shouldn’t be given, such as over a bank holiday, but not if it should be given. There are guidelines on how much: in canton St Gallen it’s about 60 minutes a week for younger primary pupils, rising to two hours or more for 10-11 year olds and to four hours a week by the end of lower secondary level (until age 15), Hauser said. Hauser is in favour of homework as it helps deepen knowledge. “If you work it out over the whole school career not doing homework is equivalent to 800 hours of lost learning,” he pointed out. Plus homework helps children develop self-regulation: making themselves do something they don’t necessary want to do - when football would be much more tempting. This is an important life lesson, he argues. He says abolishing homework is still unusual in Switzerland. There are no official statistics, but he estimates that every 10-20 years there is an anti-homework movement, but it’s usually only a few schools who implement the policy. (However, the central of canton Schwyz uniquely did go as farExternal link as abolishing homework in 1993 but this only lasted four yearsExternal link due to parent protest).  There is no wave at present, the professor says, it’s more that when a school decides to abolish homework, it comes under extreme scrutiny. Not all schools take the same route either. “There are some schools which totally abolish homework, but others keep homework but bring it into the school. When you do this, the negative effect is not so large. But it’s to the detriment of those pupils who can work independently because they are supervised at school,” Hauser said. And what of the situation in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, which has its own curriculum? Samuel Rohrbach, from the Swiss union of French-speaking teachersExternal link, said homework was regularly discussed in the region. “Several cantons such as Neuchâtel and Jura have published directives containing for example the maximum time to be spent per day on homework. People don’t want pupils to have too heavy a burden,” Rohrbach said via email. The association also raises the inequality issue but also the need to learn autonomy through doing homework. It proposes supervised sessions in schools which would give all pupils the benefit of support. The work should also be a continuation of what was done in class and nothing new, added Rohrbach. Hauser has also been thinking about how to boost equal opportunities. In addition to daily homework assistance sessions being available at school – some schools offer this type support already but often only a few times a week – educationally disadvantaged parents could be offered courses on how best to support their children during homework, he argues. That way, those pupils who can and are able to do homework at home can, and those who can’t get the support they need, he said. Meanwhile, the Feldli-Schoren school is set evaluate its project before the summer holidays, headteacher Schäpper told the St Galler TagblattExternal link. No decision has been made yet about whether there will be homework - or not - in the next school year. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-23;Big reductions in Swiss public transport services;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/corona-measures_big-reduction-in-swiss-public-transport-from-today/45636176;Swiss public transport has been widely reduced as of Monday, with the Federal Railways cutting back on services as part of nationwide anti-coronavirus measures. The scaling back of Europe’s most-used rail network in an effort to combat the spread of Covid-19 was announced last week as part of wider measures to reduce social contact and slow down the pace of life in the country. As of Monday, the density of services on various major intercity lines has been reduced, while some smaller connecting lines will be scrapped altogether. Federal Railways boss Andreas Meyer called it the biggest timetable change in the network’s history. Some cross-border routes have also been affected, including the newly inaugurated Léman Express line connecting Geneva, in southwestern Switzerland, and surrounding France. More changes and reductions in services are planned for Thursday March 26. In the meantime, timetables are being updated by 8:00 pm the previous evening on the network’s websiteExternal link. The scaling back, which also affects local bus and tram networks across the country, is a proactive measure taken under the country’s anti-coronavirus strategy. It coincides with plummeting demand as many people now work from home, if at all. Passenger numbers were estimated to have dropped by up to 20% in the first week of March.  On Monday, the Keystone-SDA agency said this figure could reach 80%.

2020-03-22;Further billions may be needed to save Swiss companies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-economy_further-billions-may-be-needed-to-save-swiss-companies/45634956;A CHF42 billion coronavirus financial aid package may not be enough to save firms from extinction, warn business leaders and economists. The state could be saddled with a bill three times higher if the crisis drags on until the end of the year. Earlier this week, the government increased its emergency funding from CHF10 billion to CHF42 billion ($42.6 billion). Some CHF14 billion will pay the wages of employees on short-time work, with CHF20 billion being offered as guaranteed loans and more funds targeted at specific industries. Non-essential high street shops and services have been ordered to shut down while the hospitality and tourism industries face a severe shortfall in guests in the coming months. It is hoped that the emergency funding will keep businesses afloat for around three months, allowing them to pay their immediate bills and retain staff. “For most companies the situation is currently not too dramatic,” Hans Hess, president of the manufacturing umbrella group Swissmem, told the SonntagsZeitung newspaperExternal link. “[But] it is certain that some customers will start to delay payments or not make them at all. There is a great danger that companies could very quickly face severe liquidity problems.” In an interview with the NZZ am SonntagExternal link newspaper, Economics Minister Guy Parmelin would not be drawn on how much extra money might be required. “We only made public the figures that we judge we need for the current situation,” he said. “The government will do everything it needs to secure the health and income of people in the future. We have to see how the situation develops.” The KOF Swiss Economic Institute has already called for a CHF100 billion fund, which it says will not violate Switzerland’s Debt Brake rules on keeping public debt in check. Should restrictions on businesses and borders last until the end of the year, companies will need CHF130 billion-worth of bailouts, the NZZ am Sonntag calculates.

2020-03-22;Swiss hospitals to take French coronavirus patients;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cross-border-care_swiss-hospitals-take-french-coronavirus-patients/45634674;Three Swiss hospitals have agreed to provide intensive care treatment for six seriously ill coronavirus patients from the neighbouring Alsace region of France. However, experts fear that Switzerland’s health infrastructure will soon be stretched by the rising number of pandemic victims. Two hospitals in Basel and one in Jura, in northwestern Switzerland, said they would each take two French patients after the Alsace authorities sent out a distress call for help. The French region has been particularly badly hit following contagion among a large church service last month. Hospitals in Germany are also providing help along with the Swiss hospitals that say they are providing help in the spirit of solidarity and international cooperation. The number of daily new coronavirus cases in Switzerland breached the 1,000 mark on Saturday and is expected to keep rising for at least a week. The number of deaths rose to more than 50 at the weekend. Healthcare workers predict serious pressure on intensive care units around the country. While the number of beds and equipment, including ventilators, can be increased, care of seriously ill patients will be constrained by a finite supply of specially trained medical staff. It takes two years to train up each intensive care professional. Hospital staff are also at high risk of catching the virus themselves. This has been highlighted by the positive test for Thierry Fumeaux, head of the intensive care unit in Nyon and president of the Swiss Association of Intensive Care Medicine. “Hospitals are concerned that they will not have enough staff or resources to cope if the number of infected patients continues to rise in the coming weeks,” he told the SonntagsZeitung newspaperExternal link. The strain on health facilities is most severe in canton Ticino bordering Italy and in some parts of French-speaking Switzerland. Other regions of Switzerland still have more capacity to take intensive care patients. Fumeaux said he was confident that the federal authorities would respond to the difficulties. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-22;Canton Ticino orders non-essential industry to cease production;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-fallout_swiss-canton-orders-non-essential-industry-to-cease-production/45634594;The southern Swiss canton of Ticino, which borders Italy, has ordered factories and production lines to temporarily close to combat the spread of coronavirus. The order has been branded excessive by a leading manufacturing association. Ticino is one of the cantons that has been hardest hit by the pandemic in Switzerland. Industry has been ordered to cease production unless it relates to critically important areas such as healthcare, food or agriculture. The order provisionally covers the week beginning Monday March 23. Factories that cannot simply turn off the switch straight away will be given time to wind down their production lines. In common with the rest of Switzerland, Ticino has already closed down non-essential high street shops and services. This was ordered by the federal authorities under the powers of the Epidemics Act. But the canton has now decided on further measures, affecting manufacturing, that may bring it into conflict with the federal government. The Justice ministry has already voiced concern about a curfew imposed on the over-65s in Uri, telling the central Swiss canton to re-think its decision. Hans Hess, president of the Swissmem industrial group that represents various manufacturing sectors, told Swiss public television SRF that Ticino’s industrial closure is unnecessary and damaging. “A complete shutdown, as in Ticino, is not in the interests of citizens,” he said. “It will lead to supply problems in the country.” “I hope Ticino will come to its senses and retract these measures, just as Uri had to do with its over-65 curfew.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

But on this spring evening, everything is closing down due to the coronavirus. Late-night drinks on packed café terraces, the hustle and bustle in the main red-light area, and a coffee and a chat between pensioners is a thing of the past.  On March 16, the Federal Council ramped up its response to the widening coronavirus pandemic, ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants, sports facilities and cultural spaces nationwide. Federal and local measures to curb the virus have reduced us to the bare essentials. Only businesses providing essential goods to the population – such as grocery stores, bakeries and pharmacies – are to remain open. Banks and post offices will also be open. The new measures are in place until April 19. The heart and soul of the quarter has been stilled – temporarily.  The big surprise during this first week of partial lockdown has been to see how strictly locals have conformed to the authorities’ rules. Even the down-and-outs who spend their days in the Place de la Navigation square – the centre of Pâquis – respect the social distancing regulations that have been imposed. But admittedly the local police are keeping a watchful eye. Time has been temporarily suspended, catching off guard the locals who are used to the usual hectic rhythm and lifestyle. Behind their four walls, each of the 10,000 Pâquis residents is quickly having to come to terms with the health emergency and perhaps reduced income, creating an uncertain future for the area which is home to numerous businesses. Sex workers, who can work legally in Switzerland, had little time to react to the news. And the lockdown has the potential of being particularly brutal for them. “Around 100 of them contacted us this week. We have tried to offer them support. Some don’t have enough money to buy food, some wanted to fly home but had their flights cancelled, while others simply might end up homeless,” explained the organisation Aspasie, which helps sex workers in the Pâquis district.  Some landlords have agreed to change some of the rental arrangements, especially for the much higher rents (up to CHF100 a day), but others have not, said Aspasie.    While waiting for the authorities’ measures of support to filter down, locals have been offering help via social media. And every evening at 9pm loud applause echoes from the balconies in support of Geneva’s health workers. Then silence returns. A dreamlike calm descends over the quarter amid the ongoing coronavirus battle.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-21;Pandemic puts paid to ice hockey world championship ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-hosts_pandemic-puts-paid-to-ice-hockey-world-championship-/45633908;The Ice Hockey World Championship, which had been scheduled to start in Switzerland from May 8, has been called off because of the coronavirus pandemic. The International Ice Hockey FederationExternal link (IIHF) took the decision on Saturday. “This is a harsh reality to face for the international ice hockey family, but one that we must accept,” said IIHF president René Fasel in a statementExternal link. “The coronavirus is a global problem and requires major efforts by government bodies to combat its spread. The IIHF must do all it can to support this fight. We have to set aside sport for now and support both government bodies and the ice hockey family.” There is no possibility to reschedule the annual tournament to another date later this year, the organisers said. Other host countries have been fixed until 2025, raising the possibility that Switzerland could miss out on hosting the event for some time. The IIHF congress will meet to thrash out the implications of the championship being cancelled this year and arrange a ticket refund policy. Orders had been received for some 300,000 tickets worth around CHF24 million ($24.4 million), Gian Gilli, CEO of the organising committee, told the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA. The tournament had “implemented a robust insurance and risk management program” to cover lost revenues from a cancellation. The 2020 IIHF annual conference, due to have been held in Zurich on May 21-23, has also been called off. It has yet to be decided when and where the meeting can be rescheduled.

2020-03-21;Swiss infection rate will take a week to slow;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-update_swiss-infection-rate-will-take-a-week-to-slow/45633466;The rate of new coronavirus infections in Switzerland will not ease for around another week, says a top health official. The number of cases saw its biggest daily rise of 1,273 on March 21, bringing the total number of infected to more than 6,100 with 56 deaths. The government has banned gatherings of more than five people, warning that CHF100 fines will be handed out to violators. Daniel Koch, head of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health, said it would take several days for the new restrictions to slow infection rates. “I am confident that we will probably see a flattening of the curve in a week. I am also confident that our death rate will remain much better than that of Italy,” Koch told a press conference. “But only if the population now adheres very strictly to the requirements.” But Koch made it clear that a flattening of the curve would not signal that Switzerland is out of danger. While acknowledging that the situation in canton Ticino, bordering Italy, remains severe, Koch said that the health infrastructure is coping with the load. There are still enough intensive care beds and hospitals are working to increase that number. The government has declared an “extraordinary situation”, allowing it to enforce restrictions across the country under the powers of the Epidemics Act. However, canton Uri appears to have overstepped the mark by ordering people aged over-65 to remain at home. The government has recommended that people stay at home whenever possible but has not expressly ordered curfews, said Justice ministry official Martin Dumermuth. Strict border controls had seen 16,000 people refused entry into Switzerland by March 21. The number of private cross-border crossings has plummeted 77% but goods transport across borders remains normal, customs official say. Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss Presidency for 2020, has written an open letter to the country, calling for all people to work together to counter the threat of the coronavirus pandemic.

Sommaruga acknowledged that people’s lives have been restricted by a series of extraordinary measures enforced by the government in recent weeks under the powers of the Epidemics Acts. These include a ban on gatherings of more than five people (including CHF100 fines for those who do not abide by the rule) and the shut down of non-essential shops and services. “These rules are important. Because they save lives. That is why we absolutely must comply with them. If the virus spreads too quickly, intensive care units in our hospitals will be overloaded. The consequences could be devastating. Now it all comes down to us,” she saidExternal link. Sommaruga urged people aged over-65 to stay at home and for everyone to avoid unnecessary contact with others. The authorities are working to help the population, but people also need to help themselves and each other by observing the restrictions that have been imposed. By March 20, more than 4,800 people had tested positive in Switzerland with almost 4,200 confirmed cases and a death toll of over 40. “Not all people can stay at home,” Sommaruga added. “We need health workers, postal workers, salespeople [in stores that remain open], truck drivers, bus drivers, our farmers and the members of the army: they see that the supply [of essential goods and services] continues to work. Many thanks to you!” “This is exactly what has always distinguished Switzerland. When push comes to shove, we are more than 26 cantons and 8.5 million people. We are one country. And we are there for each other.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system. If you see any display errors, please let us know: community-feedback@swissinfo.ch

Many of the objects were donated by the public.  Like all cultural institutions in the country, and across Europe, the Alpine Museum has had to close its doors as part of the lockdown. However, choice bits can be viewed on the museum’s websiteExternal link, or seen in a book made especially for the exhibition. It is a collection of postcards harking back to the decades when skiing was a passion - not just a pastime - for the Swiss.  The number of days people spent on the ski slopes declined dramatically from the 2008/09 season to 2016/17. Interestingly, the under-30s are rediscovering the sport, joining the baby boomer generation in keeping ski resorts busy.  Climate change has also had a significant impact on skiing’s popularity. In recent years, only high-altitude resorts have had enough snow – or weather cold enough to make snow – to keep their slopes open. For many Swiss, they at least have memories of the days when, according to the lyrics of a popular tune, “everyone skied”.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The Swiss foreign ministry has urged the estimated tens of thousands of Swiss travelers still abroad to get in contact via a special app. Two planes have been chartered from Edelweiss, part of Swiss International Air Lines, to fly to Lima and Bogota on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Arrangements are also being made for 100 citizens to be brought back from Costa Rica. “Over the last few days, the FDFA [foreign ministry], together with tour operators and travel associations, has been intensively searching for ways to reach blocked tourists in order to bring them back to Switzerland. Thanks to the proven collaboration with SWISS and Edelweiss, an initial solution has been found for Latin America,” read a statementExternal link. The government has pre-financed the flights but passengers will have to pay for their individual tickets, bearing part of the costs. The foreign ministry has sent out an appeal for all Swiss travelers to get in contact via its Travel Admin AppExternal link. Only 7,710 of the “several tens of thousands” of Swiss tourists abroad have so far submitted their name, contact number and place of stay. “This is the only way we can get a good picture of the situation in the world,” said Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis. “This will enable support to be provided more quickly and in a more targeted manner.” People using the app are also urged to cancel their registrations once they return home. Over the last weeks, Switzerland has cooperated with other countries, such as France and Germany, to repatriate citizens trapped abroad by the pandemic. Further flights are being planned.

2020-03-20;Switzerland tightens restrictions, announces more economic aid;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-crisis_switzerland-tightens-restrictions--announces-more-economic-aid/45631672;The Swiss government has announced a countrywide ban on gatherings of more than five people in public spaces to stem the spread of the coronavirus and a CHF32 billion ($32.7 billion) financial package to help the economy. Interior Minister Alain Berset said the ban would come into force at midnight Friday and remain in place until April 19. People found violating the ban face a fine of CHF100. He appealed to citizens to keep a distance of two metres apart. However, the government stopped short of announcing a complete nationwide lockdown. This is a very Swiss approach, the government doesn't impose restrictions that people can't understand, Berset told a news conference on Friday. It is a harsh measure in a free society but necessary to protect the vulnerable people. He said the measures should be applied with common sense and needed to be understood by everybody. But he came out against what he called populist announcements by governments in other countries where the measures are not implemented. Berset again appealed to the spirit of citizenship and self-responsibility. It is a serious situation and we are facing hard times, he said, appealing to all members of society to adhere to the rules. The government also ordered companies, notably in the building sector, to be closed if they are found in contravention of the health rules. In addition, additional troops can be deployed to support civil authorities, private and public institutions and the population to cope with the crisis. The government also announced an additional CHF32 billion for the labour market, including tourism, culture and sports. This package is in addition to the CHF10 billion already announced a week ago to cushion the expected downturn caused by the virus. These measures are intended to safeguard jobs, guarantee wages and support the self-employed, said Economics Minister Guy Parmelin. The bulk of the cash will go into guarantees for bank loans - CHF20 billion - for companies with liquidity problems and for very modest interest  rates, according to Finance Minister Ueli Maurer. He did not exclude further aid packages at a later stage to avoid a collapse of the economy.  The right to compensation in the event of a reduction in work will be extended to temporary workers and for people in an apprenticeship, so that companies will not have to let their apprentices go. Parents who have to interrupt their work to care for their children after schools closed can claim compensation. The same applies in the event of an interruption of work due to a quarantine ordered by a doctor. The package is subject to approval by a parliamentary committee and is set to come into force next Thursday. The Swiss economy currently still works at about 80%, according to Parmelin and the loss in GDP is currently estimated at about CHF30 billion.

2020-03-20;WHO and Roche launch trials of potential coronavirus treatments;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_who-and-roche-launch-trials-of-potential-coronavirus-treatments/45630498;"Roche is launching a clinical trial of a potential new Covid-19 drug, adding to rapidly growing investments in combating coronavirus after the World Health Organization (WHO) unveiled plans for its own trial to study potential treatments. The Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday it was working with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US government to initiate a phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety of Actemra, a drug used to treat cytokine release syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, two inflammatory diseases. The drug is known as RoActemra outside the US. Some preliminary reports suggest that patients with severe Covid-19 disease develop cytokine release syndrome, also known as a “cytokine storm,” an overshooting of the immune system, doctors have said. The study will enrol about 330 patients globally starting next month, including in the US. Actemra, which works by inhibiting the body’s immune response, is not currently approved for Covid-19 by the FDA. The announcement came the day after the WHO launched its own trial — named SolidarityExternal link — saying it will be simple enough to permit the participation of hospitals struggling to cope with the burden of extra patients. The WHO warned that the trickle of results from smaller studies may not be robust enough to make the right medical decisions. So far, 10 countries have signed up, including Argentina, Canada, France, Iran and Switzerland, but not including Italy or China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said he hoped more would join. “I continue to be inspired by the many demonstrations of solidarity from all over the world,” he added. Drugmakers, governments and universities have been conducting trials on potential treatments for Covid-19 across the world, but especially in China where the outbreak began. Mr Tedros warned that might not be enough: “Multiple small trials with different methodologies may not give us the clear, strong evidence we need about which treatments help to save lives,” he said at a WHO press conference. There are three main categories of treatments: antivirals, used for diseases such as HIV or Ebola, which would work by stopping the virus from replicating; antibodies, developed from those made by patients with the disease and given to boost the immune system; and anti-inflammatories, usually used for conditions like arthritis, if the disease kicks the immune system into overdrive, hampering breathing. The WHO will test four different drugs or combinations against the standard of care in the country where the trial is conducted. The trial will include Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir, which many analysts believe is the best prospect for treating coronavirus. It will also test a combination of HIV drugs from AbbVie — lopinavir and ritonavir. It will also test these two drugs alongside an anti-inflammatory previously used to treat multiple sclerosis. The fourth strand will look at the performance of the antimalarial drug chloroquine, which is a generic medicine out of patent. The launch came as early results from trials in China showed that anti-flu drug Avigan was working against coronavirus. But it has serious side-effects for pregnant women. There was disappointing news from another study, a controlled clinical trial with 200 patients in Wuhan, China, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found that the lopinavir-ritonavir combination had no effect on patients’ disease. But the authors suggest that the HIV drugs might work better if other antiviral agents are added to the mixture.

2020-03-19;Swiss football players dismissed after coronavirus package fallout;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-football-players-dismissed-after-coronavirus-package-fallout/45629596;Nine FC Sion football players have been dismissed after refusing to agree to a partial employment proposal in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  FC Sion, a team in the top tier of the Swiss Football League, has terminated the contracts of nine players without notice after they refused to accept the terms of their reduced pay package due to the interruption of the championship due to coronavirus. The package entitles players to 80% of their monthly salary up to a ceiling of CHF12,500 ($12,673). The nine dismissed include Pajtim Kasami, Alex Song, Ermir Lenjani, Xavier Kouassi, Seydou Doumbia, Mickaël Facchinetti, Christian Zock, Birama Ndoye and Johan Djourou. Seven of the nine have fixed term contracts that expire in June. The players will have to leave the team, which means FC Sion will have to end the season with a very small squad if the Swiss Super League resumes. As everywhere in Europe, the Swiss first and second division championships have been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis. After 23 league games, FC Sion is in eighth place (out of ten) in the standings, just four points clear of the relegation zone.

2020-03-19;What to expect at Swiss borders and airports;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_what-s-going-on-at-the-swiss-border/45629122;"Who can still enter the country? Who is being turned away? What do you do if you have a flight booked to Switzerland next week? An overview of the latest border situation.Editors' note - this story is current as of March 19; you can find continuous updates of the border situation here.External link  The Swiss government earlier this week introduced wide-ranging checks at land borders with surrounding Austria, France, and Germany, after previously having done so last week with Italy. Only Swiss citizens, Swiss residents, those entering the country for professional reasons (e.g., those who work here and have a permit to prove it), and those transiting through, can enter. Even foreign partners of Swiss citizens, who do not have a right of residence in the country, will be turned away. On Wednesday, the restrictions were ramped up againExternal link: travellers arriving by air from the four neighbouring countries are now also unwelcome, as are people coming from Spain, along with those from outside the Schengen visa-free area. On the roads, it has meant a significant drop in the number of people entering the country; by up to 70% compared to a month ago, according to figures given on Thursday by the Federal Customs Administration (FCA). This number is even higher for the Italian border with canton Ticino, which was the first to introduce checks and start closing some posts. But it has not led to a situation of deserted frontiers. In many places, it has been the opposite, at least initially. Long traffic jams due to the checks meant that some cross-border workers coming from France were taking several hours to complete a journey normally done in 45 minutes, ReutersExternal link reported on Tuesday. In the southwestern canton of Geneva, where some 60% of nurses are French, a new system of car stickers was quickly introduced for those working in the health, emergency services or policing sectors. These workers were then funnelled into priority lanes – a “green lane” system which is now being rolled out at all border crossings, says FCA head Christian Bock. The Tribune de Genève newspaper, meanwhile, reportedExternal link from some border points that while some people were being turned back for not having the proper residence or work papers – including in cross-border trams – most people were simply experiencing delays, and most were understanding about it. On Thursday, Bock confirmed that 11,000 people have been turned back since the closures came into force. Several attempts had also been made to break through the border, he said, mostly in the northwest region, but none were successful. Finally, according to the FCA, some 130 border postings have been closed completely as of Thursday – often smaller postings, shut down in order to facilitate the work of border guards by channelling traffic through fewer, but bigger, crossing points. At airports, the situation has been described as strangely calmExternal link, what with cancelled flights, closed shops and entry restrictions disrupting the normal rhythms of international travel. Swiss International Airlines has reported grounding 24 of its planes at a military airfield outside Zurich, since they’re not being used. One trade union has called for the complete closure of Geneva airport. That said, on Thursday morning, plenty of flights were still announcedExternal link as having landed at Zurich airport, including from Rome, Paris, Frankfurt, and Madrid. However, according to the restrictions introduced the previous evening, anyone on flights from such destinations who is not a Swiss citizen or resident, coming for work or transiting through would not be allowed into the country, “except in a situation of absolute necessity”. What happens to those not meeting the entry requirements? The government writes that authorities at airports would be “introducing measures” to enforce the new rules, but didn’t specify further. A Zurich airport police spokesperson told swissinfo.ch on Thursday that the “normal procedures” apply – that is, papers are checked, and somebody denied entry will be accompanied to a transfer desk, with the responsibility for covering the return flight falling on the airline involved. However, no statistics were available on how many such cases had occurred thus far. In sum, unless you are Swiss or live in Switzerland, the places from which you can now fly into the Alpine nation have shrunk to the 26 Schengen Area countries, minus Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. If you do fly from one of these countries, you should make sure you’ll be able to get back there again, since many nations have introduced their own restrictions, and quarantine requirements, on who can enter, and from where. As for Swiss citizens or residents coming home from other countries with high rates of positive coronavirus cases, quarantine is currently not being enforced. The Federal Office of Public Health writes in its Covid-19 overviewExternal link that “there is now a risk of becoming infected with the new coronavirus in almost all parts of the world. As of 9 March we will therefore no longer be referring to ‘affected areas’.” The foreign ministry, meanwhile, has called on Swiss citizens currently travelling abroad to try and come back as soon as possible, since mounting cancellations and border closures can lead to tricky diplomatic situations, such as that in Morocco earlier this week (now resolved). It is not known how many Swiss tourists are still stuck abroad, or searching for routes home. Some 15,000 are registered on the foreign ministry’s Itineris platformExternal link, an online registration for citizens travelling abroad. Finally, under the Swiss Abroad ActExternal link, the foreign ministry has reiterated several times that nationals abroad cannot claim the right to an organised departure from a crisis area. The ministry and its embassies will provide citizens abroad with assistance in crisis situations as much as they can, it says. But no mass repatriation is in the works.

2020-03-19;Shortage of hospital beds in Ticino as virus toll rises;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-pandemic_shortage-of-hospital-beds-in-ticino-as-virus-toll-rises/45629250;The Swiss health authorities have raised alarm over the limited care facilities in one of its regions hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic.  “The situation in Ticino is dramatic,” said Daniel Koch of the Federal Office of Public Health at a news conference on Thursday.  He said it was foreseeable that the hospitals in canton Ticino, bordering Italy, will not have beds for patients in intensive care in the next few days.  Koch said the number of places had been increased to avoid a situation where some patients can’t be admitted to hospital any longer, and a transfer to another region is too risky.  Overall Swiss hospitals have a total of 800 beds in intensive care, currently about 160 are still available.  Ticino has almost 180 cases of confirmed infections per 100,000 people. the number of cases is likely to rise further.  However, Koch said efforts were underway to provide more beds and other medical devices, including respirators to Ticino.  Meanwhile, Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose portfolio includes health matters, has pledged to provide financial support to the Italian-speaking region in southern Switzerland.  Following talks with the cantonal authorities, Berset said the government was discussing a package of measures to support the different sectors of the local economy, granting access to special funds.  He said the restrictions, notably the closure of restaurants, bars and shops selling non-essential goods, will have a serious impact. The army also deployed medical personnel in Ticino to provide logistical support for hospitals. Ticino’s economy, which relies on more than 60,000 cross-border workers, is a popular tourist destination.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-19;Why Switzerland struggles to keep track of coronavirus cases;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/crunching-the-numbers_why-switzerland-struggles-to-keep-track-of-coronavirus-cases/45628604; As our readers may have noticed, when it comes to tracking cases of Covid-19 in Switzerland, the numbers do not always add up. A fast-changing situation and counting methods that vary at the federal and cantonal levels account for some of the discrepancy. If you take the latest tally from the Federal Office of Public Health, the pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the world has claimed 33 lives in the landlocked nation. Media conglomerate Tamedia, which has a dedicated team aggregating cantonal data, counts 35. The gap between these two figures can be significantly larger within a single 24-hour period. We do not intend to conceal anything,” Daniel Koch, head of communicable diseases at the public health office, told reporters this week when asked about the discrepancies. “We will publish the detailed figures as quickly as possible. The variation in numbers reflects the speed at which the situation is changing in Switzerland and is perhaps an inevitable consequence of a federal system of government in which national and cantonal authorities have embraced different counting methods. For now, the government issues an updated tally only once a day, based on information sent by the cantons in the morning. Koch admits it is a challenge to keep the numbers up to date. At the moment the numbers are increasing so quickly that we also have trouble entering all the data in order to be able to carry out the analyses,” Koch told journalists on Tuesday, stressing that the authorities were not trying to hide or withhold information. The government’s struggle to get a grip on the data is also a byproduct of outdated methods. Cantons flag new cases on forms that they fill out and fax to the central government, as Swiss public television SRF notes. External link Federal authorities wait for cases to be confirmed by the reference lab in Geneva before updating their numbers, while some cantons report on suspected cases with or without such confirmation. With Europe replacing China as the epicenter of the epidemic, the Swiss government has also come under criticism for not embracing a more aggressive testing strategy early on. Bern rejects the criticism and says tests are being carried out at maximum capacity, although screenings are limited to those at risk showing severe symptoms and health workers. If you factor population size, Switzerland tests at about the same pace as South Korea, which has been touted as a success case in its handling of the pandemic. This is only the beginning of the wave,” warned Koch. “The number of cases will increase and we must do everything to smooth it out and avoid overloading hospitals.” Data experts in Switzerland have been flagging the steep increase in the number of cases, which is doubling every three days. The numbers are subject to big variations from day to day,” says Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva, “because we are in an exponential growth phase, but also depending on the methods of measurement or data collection.  Flahault is documenting daily the progression of Covid-19 in several countries, including Switzerland. He forecasts Switzerland will have nearly 7,000 confirmed cases by March 24. The mortality rate remains low, especially relative to neighbouring Italy, which has been particularly hard hit on account of its sizeable elderly population and a healthcare system that endured more than a decade of austerity measures. Unlike other countries, Switzerland has not provided information on the number of people in intensive care or the extent of capacity in hospitals, French-language newspaper Le TempsExternal link notes in a report on the issue. + Rapid spread of coronavirus complicates systematic testing Thirty laboratories carry out diagnostics across the country. In the absence of a unified national strategy, some cantons are trying to speed up the process by rolling out rapid test centres and mobile teams to check people who are suspected of having the virus. Vaud and Zurich have overtaken Ticino as the cantons with the most reported cases. It remains to be seen whether the spike in cases in these two places is a result of more aggressive testing. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-19;‘We will come through this together’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_-we-will-come-through-this-together-/45627602;"The upheaval caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, is all around us. And I know many are anxious, worried and confused. That’s absolutely natural. We are facing a health threat unlike any other in our lifetimes. Meanwhile, the virus is spreading, the danger is growing, and our health systems, economies and day-to-day lives are being severely tested.  The most vulnerable are the most affected, particularly our elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions, those without access to reliable health care, and those in poverty or living on the edge.  The social and economic fallout from the combination of the pandemic and slowing economies will affect most of us for some months. But the spread of the virus will peak. Our economies will recover.  Until then, we must act together to slow the spread of the virus and look after each other. This is a time for prudence, not panic. Science, not stigma.  Facts, not fear.   Even though the situation has been classified as a pandemic, it is one we can control. We can slow down transmissions, prevent infections and save lives. But that will take unprecedented personal, national and international action.  Covid-19 is our common enemy.  We must declare war on this virus.  That means countries have a responsibility to gear up, step up and scale up.  How? By implementing effective containment strategies; by activating and enhancing emergency response systems; by dramatically increasing testing capacity and care for patients; by readying hospitals, ensuring they have the space, supplies and needed personnel; and by developing life-saving medical interventions.  All of us have a responsibility too, to follow medical advice and take simple, practical steps recommended by health authorities.    In addition to being a public health crisis, the virus is infecting the global economy.  Financial markets have been hard hit by the uncertainty. Global supply chains have been disrupted. Investment and consumer demand have plunged - with a real and rising risk of a global recession.   UN economists estimate that the virus could cost the global economy at least $1 trillion this year – and perhaps far more. No country can do it alone. More than ever, governments must cooperate to revitalize economies, expand public investment, boost trade, and ensure targeted support for the people and communities most affected by the disease or more vulnerable to the negative economic impacts – including women who often shoulder a disproportionate burden of care work.  A pandemic drives home the essential interconnectedness of our human family. Preventing the further spread of Covid-19 is a shared responsibility for us all.  The UN – including the World Health Organization (WHO) - is fully mobilised. As part of our human family, we are working 24/7 with governments, providing international guidance, helping the world take on this threat.   We are in this together – and we will get through this, together.

2020-03-19;Social distancing is hard but can save lives;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_social-distancing-is-hard-but-can-save-lives/45628010;Video calls, reading stories through a window, and dancing in the garden make these hard times a bit easier to get through. Everyone knows this is a temporary sacrifice that has to be made to ensure many more happy moments together in the future.  In this family living in Ticino, four generations are used to sharing moments of joy and love on a daily basis. However, the coronavirus pandemic and the recommendations issued by the Federal Office of Public Health require the younger members of the family to stay away from their elderly relatives in order to shield them from a disease that could put their lives in danger. The first case of Covid-19 in Switzerland was detected in Ticino on February 25. Since then, all cantons have reported cases, and the Federal Council issued an official recommendation asking the population to stay at home. People should leave their house only to buy groceries, go to the pharmacy or doctor's office, and to go to work, if they cannot work from home. The country now has over 3,000 people confirmed cases and over 20 deaths. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-19;Banks lobby regulators to relax post-crisis rules;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-and-markets_banks-lobby-regulators-to-relax-post-crisis-rules/45627628;"The global banking industry is demanding regulators relax or delay a raft of post-crisis rules on everything from capital and liquidity to accounting and climate change, which they argue are hampering their ability to respond to the coronavirus crisis.  Executives have launched the globally co-ordinated push to convince supervisors including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and US regulators to ensure that new rules and standards do not impede their efforts to keep money flowing to the real economy.  “With the pandemic continuing to cause significant pressures on markets . . . in short time, policymakers may need to move to new realms of response — including targeted supervisory and regulatory policy measures,” said Axel Weber, chairman of Swiss bank UBS and the Institute of International Finance, a worldwide trade body for the industry. “Anything short of a global, integrated approach will prove unsuccessful.” This month the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index and the Dow Jones Bank Index of US lenders have each lost more than 40 per cent, while the cost of insuring bank debt through credit default swaps has soared. As the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets, the Bank of England made an emergency cut to interest rates and the Federal Reserve slashed US interest rates to zero, part of wider packages to shore up support for the global economy. “Cutting interest rates is almost irrelevant,” said one executive at a global bank, who is among those leading the lobbying effort. “The right thing to do is to get the regulation appropriate to the conditions and to flood the market with liquidity.”  Chief among their concerns is the introduction of new international capital rules known as Basel IV that force banks to hold extra loss-absorbing buffers, according to several people briefed on the discussions between banks and supervisors.  + Read how the Swiss National Bank has responded to the crisis One executive said banks were pushing for an extension of the implementation of Basel IV — which is due to come into full effect by 2027 — to prevent banks having to build up capital levels by 2021.  “Banks have started to lobby for substantial changes to Basel IV, that is where they will fight,” said Jérôme Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.  However, Sascha Steffen, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, warned regulators not to roll back the introduction of capital rules that were “responsible for the fact that banks have entered the coronavirus crisis in a much better position than they did the 2008 crisis”.  Bill Coen, the former head of the Basel committee of international banking regulators, said that after two decades of engaging with bank advocacy efforts, “my knee-jerk, somewhat cynical reaction is the phrase ‘never let a good crisis go to waste’”. “However, in this crisis extraordinary measures are required,” he added. “So long as the measures are just temporary, not structural or permanent, it could help reestablish confidence. I don’t think regulators are using the word forbearance; flexibility is the better ‘F’ word.” Capital requirements are just one area where banks are demanding regulatory relief. The industry has identified an array of other rules on accounting and liquidity they describe as “procyclical” — meaning that they become more onerous in times of economic stress.  In Europe, banks are calling for supervisors to delay the introduction of tough new accounting rules, known as IFRS9, which force banks to set aside money to cover loans to distressed borrowers before they actually start to default.  The industry fears they could be forced to record large upfront losses that would eat into their capital buffers and impede their ability to lend to struggling companies and consumers.  Lenders in the UK have written to the Bank of England to demand that the transition to the new accounting rules — which are due to come into full effect by 2023 — is extended, said several people who have seen the letter.  Executives made much the same argument at a meeting in Downing Street last week with the chancellor Rishi Sunak; Mark Carney, the outgoing BoE governor; and Andrew Bailey, the new governor.  Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, which is based in the UK but also has a sizeable Wall Street investment bank, “repeatedly pushed” the IFRS9 issue at the meeting, said several people who attended.  Banks are confident the BoE will act to ameliorate the impact of the accounting rules. “They are open minded to delaying or at a minimum looking through it but not completely suspending it,” said one person briefed on the discussions. Another executive said they expected the ECB to follow suit.  Mr Carney also promised to raise the issue with banks’ auditors to remind them that while the accounting standards required lenders to predict future losses, they also allowed some leeway to “look through” crises such as the coronavirus outbreak and make smaller provisions if they believe there is going to be a quick “V-shaped” recovery.  Several executives said the industry was also asking supervisors to take a “best efforts” approach to money laundering and market abuse, whereby banks would avoid punishment as long as they had tried to do the right thing — even if they had technically breached rules.  For example, with many traders and compliance staff working from home, banks have asked for leniency on the requirement that they record the phone calls of traders and dealmakers. Some lenders have reported difficulty distributing recording devices to staff who are operating remotely.  Banks also said that at a time of exploding trading volumes they are struggling to input extra data into the monitoring systems used to create compliance and market abuse alerts, which supervisors use as a starting-point for investigating malpractice. They argue that their IT departments should be focused primarily on ensuring that their trading systems are able to operate smoothly.  Executives have also asked that the transition from the discredited Libor rate to new interest benchmarks be delayed from its current hard deadline of 2022 to free up employees to work on more pressing matters. Some signs exist that regulators are reacting favourably to the banks’ demands. For instance, the US Federal Reserve has relaxed some bank liquidity requirements while the Securities and Exchange Commission has waived some requirements on recording traders’ calls.  In Germany, the main financial watchdog loosened capital requirements on Wednesday, partially reversing its earlier position, while European regulators have delayed stress tests that measure banks’ balance street strength.  In addition to lobbying their own national regulators, banks are co-ordinating their efforts globally through the IIF, the global trade body. Still, bank executives have bemoaned a lack of international co-operation.  “The increasingly nationalist politics of the world has meant that there has been little to no co-ordinated action between the individual countries,” said the bank executive, who contrasted the lack of co-operation with the co-ordinated measures taken during the 2008 financial crisis.  Another person involved in the talks added: “As each country is making decisions, the issue of co-ordination becomes quite urgent.”  In addition, banks are pushing back against newer regulations that will require them to start disclosing the exposure to climate-related risks from the end of the year.  In the UK, banks are also pushing for the BoE to delay climate change stress tests. “Steps on the whole green debate have put an additional onus on banks,” said the executive. “We’ve got to be pragmatic.” Additional reporting by Tabby Kinder in London, Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt, and Kiran Stacey in Washington Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019 This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-19;Bern in the time of coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_bern-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/45625916;" Everyone has a strong opinion on the coronavirus,” says former swissinfo.ch journalist Gaby Ochsenbein, who describes the unprecedented situation in the Swiss capital, Bern, created by the coronavirus outbreak. What a glorious spring day it is in Bern, during such bleak times. The coronavirus is omnipresent - invisible, but perceptible. Everyday life has changed, diluted, and the stately pace in Bern has slowed down to a crawl. There is a lot on people's minds. I awake to the beautiful sound of chirping birds, but today something is missing: the lively laughter and chatter of children running past my house at eight in the morning, trying to get to the local school on time.  It is the first day of the national lockdown in Switzerland and schools are closed. The children have to stay at home to help slow the spread of the pandemic. It's even quieter than usual in the crèche down the street. Many parents are keeping their young pre-school children at home as well, out of solidarity and a sense of responsibility toward others. On my walk to the River Aare, an elderly man from the retirement home next door feeds the crows breadcrumbs, as he always does. He greets me kindly - as always. Further down the river, two ten- year-old boys are fishing. They don't seem remotely unhappy that school has been cancelled. On Parliament Square - the Bundesplatz - there is nothing but overwhelming emptiness. The traditional bustling farmer’s market, which usually takes place today, has been closed to protect the population. Likewise, all restaurants, cafes, and cinemas have been shuttered. How long will it be before I can once again enjoy a coffee and read the newspaper at my favourite café, I wonder? Virtually all shops that do not sell everyday essentials - groceries and medicine - are shut. The same goes for bookstores. In a sign of the times, a placard on one shop philosophises, corona time is reading time . Of course, books and many other items can always be ordered online. The city is so much quieter than usual; the atmosphere is eerie, almost ghostly. And people are highly conscious of themselves and their physical space. Some look around suspiciously, even fearfully, at fellow pedestrians, and refrain from crossing the street where there’s a possibility of coming into closer contact with another person. People have also started to use their elbows instead their fingers to press the buttons that open tram and bus doors. And the elbow is also extended to greet friends, replacing the hugs and the traditional three-kiss greeting in Bern. It’s strange, everyone comments, but it makes sense. The situation is serious. Up until recently, I shook hands with my Kurdish-Iranian German student before class - another traditional Swiss custom. Not anymore. He tells me that the asylum centre has instructed them to wash their hands regularly and to keep their distance from one another. This is no mean feat, as six to eight people share a room. What would it be like if Switzerland were to institute a curfew, like in Italy? There people can only leave their homes or apartments to go to work or to shop for essentials. I read that in Italy, people with dogs are allowed go outside to walk them. But I don't have a dog. I couldn’t get one even if I wanted - the pet stores are closed. And buying a dog online is not possible. But books, yes. Corona time is reading time! This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-19;Coronavirus catches managers off guard;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-and-globalization_coronavirus-catches-managers-off-guard/45624906;The coronavirus has laid bare the fragilities and complex dependencies generated by globalisation. American-Swiss professor Suzanne de Treville, a specialist in helping firms relocate their industrial activities to the west, hopes that this crisis will trigger some major soul-searching.  Covid-19 is on the verge of bringing the world economy to its knees. From Asia to Europe and the United States, the new coronavirus that sprung from China has had a crippling effect on the economy, causing stock markets around the world to nosedive and dealing a severe blow to global growth. But this crisis has also revealed the risks and dependencies of long production lines and supply chains. Using tools derived from quantitative finance, Suzanne de Treville, professor of operations management at the University of Lausanne, has set out to prove that it is more advantageous to produce locally than abroad, even for expensive Switzerland. swissinfo.chExternal link: In just a few weeks, the coronavirus has managed to wipe out the entire global economy. Have our leaders underestimated the fragility of globalisation and the systemic risks it entails? Suzanne de Treville: Most managers are not able to integrate shocks like the coronavirus into their decision-making models. They assume that everything will always go well, whereas we know that this is not the reality. One out of 100 or 500 major problems will occur. The risks associated with lengthening the production chain are considerable and very often ignored. Therefore it is essential to train future managers in logical and systemic thinking. Together with my assistant Jordi Weiss, we have developed software and simulation models that make it possible to calculate the real costs of outsourcing. + Here is an open access version of the simulatorExternal link swissinfo.ch: Could the coronavirus crisis serve as a wake-up call? S. d.T.: One can only hope so. The consequences of the covid-19 epidemic on people's lives and the economy are serious enough to trigger conversations that were unthinkable just a few weeks ago. From the mid-1990s, we started relocating everything to China and developing countries, without really thinking about the risks and dependencies that this would entail. Today, the awakening is brutal, with many business leaders questioning how such stupid decisions could have been taken at the time. swissinfo.chExternal link: Yet the world today is more interdependent. China accounts for nearly one-fifth of the world's production and is an integral part of global supply chains. Chinese tourists spend more than $260 billion a year. Is it truly possible to turn back the clock? Over the past 20 years, we assigned innovation to rich countries and production to “low-cost” economies. However, innovation cannot be completely decoupled from industrial activities. Industrial activities also provide many jobs. For every industrial job, you create between five and ten jobs in the supply chain or in the services sectors. That's a lot. Likewise, it is no longer possible today to keep production and service operations separate, as had been the case up to now. The two must now be closely linked. swissinfo.chExternal link: What do you mean? S. d.T.: Let's take the example of the textile industry. The fast-fashion giants are currently flooding their shelves with cheap clothes produced under poor working conditions in China and Bangladesh. Often, however, only 10-20% of this merchandise is sold and the rest is destroyed to make way for new collections. This is totally absurd, economically, socially and ecologically. The textile industry is the second most polluting industry in the world. In the US, the department of commerce is using a tool developed by my laboratory over the last six years to repatriate this industry to the US. This would create jobs there and put an end to this absurd waste. swissinfo.ch: How will they tackle this? S. d.T.: In future, when you want to buy a shirt, you will have the opportunity to go to a personal advisor who will scan your body to design a tailormade garment for you. The order will then be placed with a small production facility located nearby or in an area of the US that needs these jobs. After 40 or 50 uses, your shirt will be returned to the shop where the fibre will be recycled and reused.  This service will be offered at a differentiated rate depending on whether you need your shirt for a wedding the following week or only three months from now. It's a bit like air travel: people travelling in first or business class pay a larger share of the flight price relative to people travelling in economy. Compared with what the major fashion retailers offer today, this circular economic model is very flexible and adapts much better to the customer's needs. swissinfo.ch: By working with the Trump administration, aren't you facilitating a protectionist economic policy that threatens the global balance?  S. d.T.: The use of our tool began under the Obama administration. In fact, the person in charge of this issue at the US Department of Commerce has been in office for 34 years and has therefore worked under both Republican and Democratic presidencies. Creating jobs and developing industrial activity is certainly the least politicised issue in the US. There is unanimous agreement on the need to curb the deindustrialisation and impoverishment that is hitting many parts of the country. swissinfo.ch: What you say may be music to the ears of American and European politicians but might be less appealing to leaders of developing nations that owe their leap forward to industrialisation in recent decades.  S. d.T.: You are mistaken. When I was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2014, there were a lot of Chinese students attending my classes. They were convinced that the way I saw things represented the hope of China. Today, Chinese factories are a living hell for workers. Over-industrialisation is also causing terrible damage to people's health and to the environment. China's leaders have already realised that they can no longer continue along this path. Instead of flooding the world with cheap products, they are concentrating more on value-added products and the internal market. In agriculture, interesting circular economy models are also being developed. Change is underway.  swissinfo.ch: And how about Switzerland? Can it really afford to maintain a competitive industry despite high production costs and a strong national currency?  S. d.T.: It's clear that despite the strong franc, the Swiss economy is doing well. For many companies, this is a detail that is very easy to offset. Switzerland has a well-trained and motivated workforce because young people can work in modern, dynamic and attractive factories. Proximity to some of the world's best universities and research centres is also an important advantage. In my research, for example, I have calculated that Switzerland's flexibility offers technology companies an added value of 15 to 100%. And that's without factoring its top-notch infrastructure, whether in the area of transport or public administration. We have in our hands all the advantages needed to develop a strong and competitive industry in Switzerland.

2020-03-18;Enough food for months, government assures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-stockpile_enough-food-for-months--government-assures/45624916;The Swiss authorities say there are food stocks available to consumers for more than four months to cope with the current coronavirus epidemic. But rationing of certain painkiller and anti-fever drugs has been introduced. “There is no reason to panic over food,” the government’s delegate for national economic supply,External link Werner Meier, said in an interview published on Wednesday in various newspapers belonging to the CH Media group.  The Swiss business sector, supported by the government, ensures that enough essential foodstuffs are stockpiled for times of crisis, according to Meier. Supermarkets and small retail shops had access to plenty of supplies to stock their shelves, he said.  “We have no reports by retailers of shortages or bottlenecks,” Meier said. Switzerland has closed its borders for people, but not for goods.” He also said there are no plans at the moment to consider imposing rules on the industry for the production of essential goods. Later on Wednesday, however, the government announced that it would begin rationing some common painkiller and anti-fever drugs to prevent panic buying. The government said the restriction, which starts immediately and will run for the next six months, was not introduced due to a shortage of drugs. Under the restriction each person will be allowed to buy only one package per day of certain drugs, including paracetamol and ibuprofen. The measure is aimed at preventing people from hoarding the drugs, said Daniel Koch from the Federal Health Office, told public television.

2020-03-18;Government to announce further Covid-19 economic measures;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/costly-virus_government-to-announce-further-covid-19-economic-measures/45626080;"The government has discussed its next steps to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and has decided to suspend debt collection procedures until April 4. The debt measure will come into force at 7 am on Thursday, March 19, and run until midnight on April 4, the government announcedExternal link. During this period, no debt proceedings can be launched. The move comes as businesses and independent workers struggle to come to terms with the government-imposed closure of bars, restaurants, non-essential shops, and entertainment, cultural and sporting venues. It follows last Friday’s announcement by Economics Minister Guy Parmelin of a CHF10 billion ($10.5 billion) emergency fund that would be put in place to try to ease the devastating impact that the Covid-19 shutdown is having on workers and the economy. Further measures were also discussed by the government on Wednesday, as the country enters the second day of a virtual lockdown, but these will likely only be announced after another session on Friday, according to the government spokesman. It’s not clear if these coming announcements will include a hike in the amount of emergency funding, or if they will rather focus on the modalities of allocating the initial CHF10 billion. Earlier on Wednesday, two economics professors from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zurich, Hans Gersbach und Jan-Egbert Sturm, recommended the creation of a national fund of CHF100 billion to stave off an impending wave of bankruptcies. Businesses could use such a fund to ensure liquidity and avoid lay-offs, the professors said, before later paying back “a good part” of what they received when the economic situation stabilises. They also recognized that Switzerland’s so-called Debt Brake, which puts limits on the amount of debt the country can rack up, would have to be put aside; but, the ETH Zurich professors say, the financial situation is currently favourable enough to allow for this. Also on Wednesday, the Crédit Suisse bank downgraded its 2020 economic outlook for the country, but perhaps not to the extent that many might have expected. Due to the coronavirus outbreak and the resulting public disruption and economic uncertainty, the bank’s economists revised their expectation of a 1% increase in GDP this year to a 0.5% downturn. This would be followed by a 2% growth in 2021, they reckoned. However, this “brief recession” is based on the expectation that the Covid-19 crisis will last until mid-May and then recede; naturally, the bank said, if the pandemic is to persist longer, then the economic consequences will be greater.

2020-03-18;Coronavirus fallout threatens existence of small companies;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fight-to-survive_coronavirus-fallout-threatens-existence-of-small-companies/45625050;Switzerland is a land of small companies, making up 99% of all firms and two-thirds of the workforce. Many are now threatened by the coronavirus crisis despite the government stumping up CHF10 billion ($10.6 billion) in emergency funds to ease the situation. Restaurants, bars and non-essential shops have been ordered to close their doors until April 19. Border restrictions have been introduced and public gatherings have been restricted. This puts the retail, tourism, hospitality and event management sectors in immediate danger. With the economy tipped to shrink in the coming months, small manufacturing firms that supply larger companies, will also face a challenge. From the CHF10 billion aid package, some CHF8 billion will compensate employees who have been told to stay at home and not work. Companies now have to give less notice of their intention to tap into the fund (three days instead of ten) and it has been extended to employees on temporary contracts. But small business owners and the self-employed will have to fend for themselves. “Coronavirus affects everyone exactly the same. But the financial aid measures are not for everyone. It is so unfair to find yourself frozen out of the system,” a partner at a dental practice told swissinfo.ch. The practice in the eastern canton of Appenzell Outer-Rhodes has been run by a husband and wife team for seven years. It has taken all of that time for the business to pay off the debts it racked up setting up operations. The cantonal authorities have effectively ordered it to cease operations, allowing it to open its doors for emergency procedures only. This is because dentists are a high-risk group for picking up the virus from patients. The six people employed by the practice are covered by a state fund that compensates lost wages during extreme economic downturns. But the registered owner and his wife, who is a partner in the business, cannot access the shortened hours compensation fund. “The only way we can survive is to take out more bank loans. We can only survive on this debt for a few months,” the partner, who did not want to be named, told swissinfo.ch. “It is unfair that employees in effect get a paid holiday, while the people taking all the risk in running a business end up with nothing.” This is a point taken up by the Swiss Small and Medium-sized Business Association, which is demanding that financial aid be extended to the self-employed and owners of micro-companies (fewer than 10 employees). “It won't help employees if a micro-company goes bankrupt because the owners have to get over their heads in debt. In this case, even employees who are entitled to short-time work benefits will lose their jobs,” it statesExternal link. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) says it has received thousands of enquiries about the short-time working hours fund and other measures, such as bridging loans. It is also considering how to refine the financial aid system to close loopholes but doesn’t as yet have all the answers. The KOF Swiss Economic InstituteExternal link at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology (ETH Zurich) says the financial support system will fall short of protecting businesses in the current climate. It has called for the creation of a CHF100 million emergency loan fund and a temporary easing of obligations for companies to declare insolvency. State support is more essential than ever before, says HotellerieSuisse that represents the hotel industry. Member companies expect revenues to drop by at least 45% for March and April. The Swiss Retail Federation (representing firms that employ 310,000 workers) reports non-food sales plunging between 30% and 60% with two-thirds of firms expecting to announce shortened hours for staff in the coming weeks.

2020-03-18;Rapid spread of coronavirus complicates systematic testing;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_rapid-spread-of-coronavirus-complicates-systematic-testing/45625060;The Swiss government has been taking heat for its targeted approach to coronavirus testing, arguing that the country has passed the point of catching every case. However, some cantons are rapidly building up back-end capacity to massively scale up testing. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on countries to ramp up testingExternal link as the best way to curb the coronavirus pandemic. “We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu told a news conference in Geneva. However, the Swiss government has not made testing the top priority in its strategy to contain the virus. Daniel Koch, head of the division of communicable diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Tuesday that widespread testing makes sense for countries at the beginning of an epidemic, in order to prevent a broad spread. That phase is over in Europe, so this [WHO] strategy is not specifically for Europe or Switzerland,” said Koch. He added that it isn’t possible in Switzerland and other countries in a similar situation to test every person who has a head cold. When the cases first started appearing in Switzerland on February 25, Switzerland had a systematic approach of testing those traveling from infected areas and those in contact with anyone who was infected. Once the virus started spreading within the country, the government decidedExternal link in early March to target testing for high-risk groups (chronic illnesses or elderly) and those which have serious symptoms. During a press conference on Monday, Health Minister Alain Berset defended the strategy: “We do not have access to 8.5 million tests, so we must act in a targeted manner.” A key part of the rationale was to not overload hospitals and rather reserve healthcare resources for those who are in the greatest danger if infected. For all others, they should stay home and follow the hygiene guidelines. The government says that it is testing around 2,500 people per day in contrast to around 20,000 testsExternal link performed per day in South Korea. Koch said that the government plans to increase capabilities and extend testing to a larger subset of the population but has given few details. Behind the scenes, cantons are building up testing infrastructure. On Monday, canton Bern announced that it will open a testing facility with a drive-thru optionExternal link. It is expected to carry out 800-1,000 tests per day with the help of Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche’s recently approved test system.  Gundekar Giebel, who heads communications for the Bern cantonal health office confirmed to swissinfo.ch that the centre will be up and running next week with almost full certainty at the BernExpo exhibition hall and that another two centres are planned in Biel and Thun. People will be able to receive results within 24 hours. “This will increase the testing capacity possibly 5 or more times the current amount,” says Giebel. It is difficult to estimate the total number of cases that have been tested thus far and how many per day but Giebel says Bern’s largest hospital, the Inselspital, has performed around 1,500 tests in the last three weeks. With the new centres, he estimates that 2,500-3,000 tests will be possible per day in the canton. Currently, there are 15-16 locations that can take nose or throat samples. This includes hospitals, a couple of doctors offices as well as a few villages with private medical centres that have set up containers. “We need to get people out of emergency rooms and out of doctor’s offices because they block the capacity for real emergency corona treatment for people,” says Giebel. As of 9:20 this morning there were 193 positive cases in Bern but things are moving so quickly he imagines that the number will end up much higher by the end of the day. Basel country has also set up two mobile teams to test people with symptoms at their homes. At present, the primary care doctor must be contacted and request testing from the mobile team. From Wednesday, doctors in Basel can also send their patients to one of two stationsExternal link the cantonal crisis team has set up in sports centres or halls. The university hospital in Canton Vaud (CHUV) has developed a toolExternal link to help the public and health professionals assess the risk of infection and determine appropriate next steps.   As of March 11, all accredited microbiology laboratories in the canton of Zurich have been able to conduct an initial diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2. If someone tests positive in the cantonal tests, results are sent to the National Reference Center for Emerging Viral Diseases (CRIVE) for confirmation. Even with the increasing capacity, questions remain about who should be tested. Giebel says that they are still in discussions about the protocol including whether people should call their primary doctor first and whether testing will be extended to more people. This has been the subject of debate and some unease among the population. Jamil Chade, a Brasilian journalist in Geneva, came down with a high fever, chills and a cough last Thursday. He had been traveling all over the city reporting and was worried that he might have been infected. He went to a private clinic in Geneva on Friday and asked to be tested. However, the doctor said that he didn’t meet the criteria for testing. She added that it wouldn’t make a difference anyway as the recommendations would be the same if he was positive or negative. “She told me to stay at home and gave me paracetamol, and said that if I had tested positive, I would have given you the same instructions.” Chade followed the doctor’s orders but believes that testing positive does make people behave differently. “If I knew I was infected, I would tell others I’ve been in contact with so they could take precautions,” he said. Criticism of Switzerland’s targeted rather than widespread approach has been mounting with a minister from SingaporeExternal link, which has been praised for its effective containment measures, singling out Switzerland and the United Kingdom for “abandoning any measure to contain or restrain the virus.” Some virology expertsExternal link inside the country have also been calling for testing to be scaled up. One of the challenges with the strategy is the confusion it creates in understanding the numbers. It is difficult to understand the scale of the problem and put the mortality rate in perspective if it is not clear how many cases actually exist. “All countries should be able to test all suspected cases, they cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded,” WHO Director General Ghebreyesu said on Monday. Without testing, cases cannot be isolated and the chain of infection will not be broken, he added. The Financial TimesExternal link reported on Tuesday that testing and retesting in the small Italian community of  Vò, near Venice had stopped all new infections in the town that was at the centre of the country’s outbreak. The Swiss government has been treading lightly to maintain public trust and not raise too many expectations. “It's not that we are hiding anything from the figures or that we don't want to share them,” explained Koch at Tuesday’s press conference. “It's just that, it is so fast and so big that we're really struggling to present these figures to you now in the form the press would like.” The pure numbers are no longer so important, said Koch. What is important is to have enough beds ready for sick people when the wave comes.

2020-03-18;Swiss court postpones Liberia war crimes trial over coronavirus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-justice-_swiss-court-postpones-liberia-war-crimes-trial-over-coronavirus-/45625234;Switzerland’s Federal Criminal Court has postponed the long-awaited war crimes trial of former Liberian rebel leader Alieu Kosiah due to the rapid spread of Covid-19.   The trial had been scheduled to take place from April 14-30 in Bellinzona, capital of Switzerland’s southern, Italian speaking canton of Ticino. It will be the first international criminal trial in a non-military Swiss court and “historic” according to Swiss group Civitas Maxima, one of the NGOs representing Liberian victims in the case.  The Federal Criminal Court hopes to reschedule the trial between June and July 2020, according to a recent press releaseExternal link from Civitas Maxima and its Liberian partner, the Global Justice and Research Project (GJRP). They said the decision taken by the Swiss court was appropriate to “safeguard the health of all the trial participants, including the victims who reside abroad”, since Liberian witnesses are being called to testify in the trial.  Kosiah, a former commander of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), is charged with war crimes committed during the first Liberian civil war (1989-1996). He was arrested in Switzerland in November 2014 and has been in pre-trial detention ever since, as Swiss authorities conducted investigations.   “This is a historical case for both Liberia and Switzerland,” says Civitas Maxima director Alain Werner, one of the two lawyers representing four of the seven plaintiffs who will testify in the trial.  “This and other cases abroad will encourage victims to come forward, and hopefully encourage the Government of Liberia to establish a domestic war crimes courtExternal link,” says Hassan Bility, Director of the GJRP.  Liberia has not so far held anyone to account for serious international crimes committed during its civil wars, although there are some cases also in other European countriesExternal link under the principle of “universal jurisdiction”. Former Liberian president Charles Taylor was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra LeoneExternal link for crimes committed in that neighbouring country, and is currently serving a 50-year sentence in a British jail.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-18;Bern distillers use their alcohol to help fight viruses;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/disaster-breeds-diversity_bern-distillers-use-their-alcohol-to-help-fight-viruses/45619964;Innovative distillers in Bern have stopped producing gin in favour of hand sanitiser.  The Matte Brennerei distilleryExternal link says it’s improvising in order to save its business and help people fend off coronavirus contamination. Washing your hands with alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses.External link From Monday, the distillery started using the strong alcohol intended for making gin, absinthe and vodka to produce its 'Desilat' disinfectant hand rub instead. Extra amounts of ethanol and packing materials have been ordered and they just have to top up the alcohol with a few additives to make it skin friendly. They have rented a former boxing club venue to store the bottles with their unassuming labels. The client is the Coop, one of Switzerland’s largest supermarket chains. When gin becomes more of a tonic The Matte Brennerei, set up in 2016 with the help of crowd funding, runs a bar offering regular tasting sessions and gin-making workshops, which normally supplement the company’s income. But things went quiet when the virus began to spread and Switzerland went into lockdown, so they had to find new ways of keeping their five employees in a job. In the meantime, demand for disinfectant increased with pharmacies and supermarkets unable to keep up with demand. The Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link gave distilleries a special dispensation so they could top up supplies. Now the Matte Brennerei staff are working flat out to get the orders ready. Deputy director Adrian Gass told swissinfo.ch, “Two weeks ago everybody thought we were crazy. Then one week ago everybody thought, “maybe it’s a good idea”. And now everybody thinks, “where are you with your stuff?” Gin is still our thing Demand for disinfectant is so strong that the Bern distillery is planning to team up with other partners if they can’t cope. However, Adrian Gass does not expect to continue with hand sanitiser production indefinitely. “I don’t think we can compete once all the bigger companies start mass producing again. It’s a good thing that we could jump in this gap and help out, and also keep our revenues going.” The Matte Brennerei is not the only drinks producer helping out in a crisis. On the website of the Schwab distilleryExternal link in Oberwil near Büren, also in canton Bern, they write: “We can supply you with either high-proof alcohol or disinfectant we produce ourselves”.

2020-03-17;Swiss militia soldiers get historic call up to fight coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-militia-soldiers-get-historic-call-up-to-fight-coronavirus/45622436;“Ding” - you have been mobilised to help Switzerland’s battle against the new coronavirus. This is the text message some Swiss militia personnel have been receiving over the past few days as part of a historic military mobilisation.  On March 16, the Swiss government announced that it was mobilising up to 8,000 members of the military to help the cantons fight the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Covid-19. This radical measure, taken during what is described as an exceptional emergency, is the largest military mobilisation in Switzerland since the Second World War.  “We mustn’t lose any time in fighting the virus,” Defence Minister Viola Amherd told a news conference in Bern on Monday.  Members of the armed forces who have been called up will offer support in the areas of health, logistics and security. The planned deployment External linkwill be applied until the end of June 2020.  The militia forces will support the health care system with medical services in particular with nursing care, patient monitoring, medical transports or hospital logistics (e.g. bed disinfection, kitchen, laundry and cleaning). Soldiers will also take over logistical tasks such as transport and assistance in setting up improvised infrastructure. They will also relieve cantonal police forces by helping protect embassies or by supporting the border guards at national borders and airports. Already some 50 soldiers have been mobilized in canton Ticino, which borders Italy in the south of the country, and some 200 have been called up by other cantons, including Basel Country, Neuchâtel, Thurgau and Graubünden. The aim is that in 3-4 days around 800 people will be available to support cantons that need help. On March 16, four hospital battalions and five medical companies were also mobilised by text message. However, on March 17, the CH Media group of newspapers reported that the deployment had suffered an early setback. Two of the medical companies sent to Airolo, canton Ticino, have been quarantined in their barracks with immediate effect. Three personnel have reportedly become infected with the virus. Another 20 people have shown symptoms. Defence spokesperson Daniel Reist said the two medical companies were conducting training in quarantine and could not be deployed but a third company outside the barracks was not affected and can be deployed. Those soldiers who are completing their training, doing refresher courses and those who are doing longer military service will be mobilised as a priority. In certain areas, additional troops will have to be called up.  In order to be able to react in good time and adequately to further developments, the government has also authorised the defence ministry to deploy troops that are not part of the militia formations with a high level of readiness, depending on the needs of the civilian authorities. This may mean that certain troops are temporarily mobilised and trained for deployment as a precautionary measure. After a few days' training, they are released from duty and can be called up for deployment at a later date if the cantons request it. In all, 3,000 of the 8,000 militia personnel will be providing medical support to the cantons. Currently, 10% of them are working as doctors or nurses. They will be passing on essential expertise to the other personnel over three days before returning to their hospitals and other medical facilities, according to Reist. “The next few weeks are going to be a big challenge,” said Amherd, “but together we can meet it. Civilian critical infrastructure is working. We are committed to keeping it that way.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-17;Roche working ‘around the clock’ to provide coronavirus test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_roche-working--around-the-clock--to-provide-coronavirus-test/45621590;After getting the green light to deploy its coronavirus diagnostic test, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche says it is working around the clock to make it as available as possible. Last Friday, the world received a glimmer of hope in the fight to contain the spread of Covid-19 that has left few countries unscathed. The US Food and Drug AdministrationExternal link granted Emergency Use Authorisation approval to the so-called “cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test”, making it the first commercial diagnostic test for the coronavirus. With this designation and the similar CE-Mark for in-vitro diagnostics in Europe, the new test can be deployed in hospitals and laboratories in the US and Europe – offering the potential to massively scale up testing. In contrast to existing tests, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told Swiss public television, SRF, that the system is highly automated, which will “reduce the burden on the healthcare system.” The test detects the genetic signature (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 using a nasal or throat swab. After a healthcare provider collects the sample from the patient, it is sent to a lab equipped with the test and the cobas 6800 or 8800 system, which is manufactured in Rotkreuz, less than an hour from Zurich. Schwan said that the system can conduct more than 4,000 tests per day. Results are available in 3.5 hours, making it ten times faster than the company’s existing test. In a press statementExternal link, Roche wrote that their cobas 6800/8800 systems, which look like massive printers, are “widely available”. A Roche spokesperson declined to comment on how many there are, or where they are, exactly. The company expects to supply about 400,000 tests per week in the US and more than three million globally. “Roche is committed to delivering as many tests as possible and is going to the limits of our production capacity,” the company wrote in a statementExternal link. According to a Roche spokesperson, the tests will be distributed based on where they can have the greatest patient and community impact. The company has also refrained from commenting on the price, stating that “the priority is to make the tests available to those who need them”.

2020-03-17;Swiss government shuts down public life amid spreading coronavirus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_switzerland-declares-coronavirus-crisis-an--extraordinary--situation/45620148;The Swiss government on Monday declared an “extraordinary situation” over the coronavirus, instituting a ban on all private and public events and closing places such as restaurants and bars in a bid to harmonise the situation across the country. “We need a strong reaction across the country and we need it now…it is the only way to surmount this crisis,” Simonetta Sommaruga, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency for 2020, told a news conference on Friday. Switzerland is particularly affected by the coronavirus epidemic. More than 2,600 people have been infected in the country and almost 20 people have died. The government banned all private and public events starting at midnight on March 17. It also ordered the closure of bars, restaurants, sports facilities and cultural spaces.  Only businesses providing essential goods to the population – such as grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, banks and post offices – are to remain open.“We know that this decision disrupts the daily life of our country,” said Interior Minister Alain Berset, warning that the situation would get worse before it gets better. The new measures are in place until April 19.  Hospitals and clinics must stay open but only for necessary procedures. Up to 8,000 members of the military will be mobilised to help contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus. This represents the largest army mobilisation since the Second World War in the 1940s.The authorities advised that individuals at higher risk of complications from the virus – “vulnerable populations” –  must work from home or be put on paid leave when that is not possible. On the education front, schools will be closed nationwide until April 19. Childcare centres may only be closed by the cantons if other suitable childcare facilities are available. Meanwhile, the Swiss Federal Railways are suspending international services and reducing their domestic services. Connections between larger towns will be available every hour rather than every 30 minutes.   The Swiss government has also decided to introduce border checks with Germany, France and Austria. Only Swiss citizens, holders of residence and work permits as well as people transiting Switzerland are allowed to enter the Alpine nation.  The Swiss government had faced growing pressure to declare a state of emergency at the national level. By Monday, several cantons had already scaled up their response to the coronavirus. Geneva, home to many international organisations and multinational corporations, banned gatherings of more than five people.  Europe is the latest frontline in the global effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Several countries – including Italy, Spain and France – have already imposed stringent lockdowns in a bid to halt the disease. In that context, some criticised the government for being slow to react. “Faced with the sluggish reaction of certain political authorities and the complacency of the media, anger is brewing within the Swiss community of doctors, caregivers, scientists and other specialists who are called upon to help our population face the Covid-19 cataclysm,” Didier Trono, professor at the virology and genetics laboratory at the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), told Swiss public television, RTS. Bertrand Kiefer, director of the Swiss Medical Review, took to Twitter to denounce the fact that the Swiss government has given up on testing all suspected cases. “Now we don’t know the reality of the epidemic,” he said. The government appears to have taken such criticism to heart. It also said on Monday it was changing its approach to testing now that Switzerland has the resources to test more people. People showing a few symptoms are now eligible for testing, not just those displaying severe symptoms that require hospitalisation.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-17;What might coronavirus triage look like in Switzerland? ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/patient-care-_what-might-coronavirus-triage-look-like-in-switzerland--/45621978;In Italy, hospitals are so overcrowded that medical staff must decide - as in wartime - who will be taken care of and who will not. If this happens in Switzerland, on what criteria will the doctors decide?  In the coronavirus crisis, should young patients be given priority over older ones? Will artificial respirators be reserved primarily for parents of young children? Should a 90-year-old patient be denied intensive care because of their age?  In Italy, doctors who are on the front line in the fight against the virus are faced with such questions. There is only one artificial respirator for every four patients with breathing difficulties. This means that some patients must be ruled out and provided only with palliative care.  The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMSExternal link) estimates that, due to the speed at which the virus is spreading in Switzerland, bottlenecks could form in intensive care units here too.  According to a Reuters reportExternal link, Switzerland does not currently have enough beds, artificial respirators or nursing staff to cope with the expected number of Covid-19 patients. So sooner or later Swiss doctors may be faced with these kinds of highly sensitive decisions.  On its websiteExternal link, the SAMS makes available its medical-ethical guidelines for intensive care interventions , which date from 2013 but which it says are still valid and can help doctors decide.  The guidelines say that “if in a large-scale emergency, such as a pandemic, it is no longer possible to provide intensive care for all patients, it must be ensured that triage is conducted according to ethical principles. The criteria applied must be objectively justified and transparent”. These criteria are to be “applied without discrimination (e.g. on the grounds of age, sex, canton of residence, nationality, religious affiliation, social and insurance status or existing chronic disability) in an equitable procedure”.   As a matter of principle, “highest priority is to be accorded to patients whose prognosis is good with, but poor without, ICU treatment”.  And in this case, “the decisive factors for prognostic assessment in this context are the probability of short-term survival of ICU treatment [...], but not medium- or longer-term life expectancy”.  This means that for Covid-19 patients, a patient’s chance of surviving the disease will be taken into account rather than general life expectancy after the epidemic has passed.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-16;Local solidarity initiatives fight virus fallout;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_solidarity-initiatives-fight-virus-fallout-in-switzerland/45620290;Local aid groups, organised by citizens or charity associations, are popping up in Switzerland in an effort to help those most vulnerable to the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic. The groups have been appearing for weeks, ever since the numbers infected by the coronavirus began to rise and Ticino became the first canton to impose strict measures. At first, many of the groups – especially on Facebook – were about offering accommodation for Italian cross-border workers, especially those in the medical or healthcare sector. Now, hundreds more such informal groups, mainly organised on WhatsApp or Facebook, are offering help to senior citizens across the country, who have been strongly advised to stay at home during the unfolding crisis. Such vulnerable people are especially in need of practical help – such as with shopping for basic goods – and emotional or communicative support, so as not to become isolated. One such initiative, Gärn Gschee – Basel HilftExternal link (You’re welcome – Basel helps), enables older people to write a post outlining what they need help with, then others to offer their services. “I’m looking for help collecting an order of 2.6kg of artichokes from the market,” wrote a 74-year-old woman. Soon afterwards, she got it. The website hilf-jetzt.chExternal link (help now) has gathered as many such initiatives as it could find, organised by locality and with links for those interested in helping. As of March 16 there were some 347 initiatives across Switzerland. Other groups have also been calling for solidarity, echoing the call by Swiss president Simonetta Sommaruga in an interviewExternal link published on Sunday in the SonntagsZeitung newspaper. On Monday, the Swiss Red Cross and the Swiss Public Utility Society launched an app, called “Five up”, which aims to provide a space for the coordination of volunteer groups. They saidExternal link that in contrast to groups organised on social media, the app allows a direct overview of where help is needed and where volunteers are available. Local chapters of the Red Cross, for example in Basel, have also organised delivery services for people quarantined at home – something they are also considering rolling out in other regions. Switzerland’s main retailers, meanwhile, have called for a more concerted effort by the population when it comes to so-called “Hamsterkäufen” (hamster buying), the German term for the panic-buying and stockpiling of essential products that has been seen in many supermarkets. On Monday, a joint statement by Coop, Migros, Aldi, Lidl, Spar, Denner, Manor and Volg appeared in the Blick newspaper, with the retailers reiterating that stocks were full and that panic-buying was not necessary. “If people buy more than what’s necessary and stockpile, it could result in others going without,” they wrote. “This would also put extra strain on our staff – in an already highly challenging time.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-16; Geneva bans gatherings of more than five people ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-_-geneva-bans-gatherings-of-more-than-five-people-/45619940;The Swiss canton of Geneva – where many international organisations have headquarters – imposed emergency measures on Monday in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. All gatherings of more than five people are banned indoors and outdoors.  The number of people in Switzerland who have tested positive for Covid-19 jumped to 2,200 between Saturday and Sunday. That figure is not complete because the Alpine nation does not practise a policy of systematic screening.  Professional gatherings are still allowed if recommendations concerning social distances and hygiene can be respected, the authorities said. The only shops allowed to remain open are those offering food and hygiene products, as well as pharmacies and hotels. Entertainment centres and sports venues must close as of Monday evening. Business activities are to be limited to the “indispensable minimum”.  Several cantons have imposed measures that exceed national guidelines. Canton Valais also unveiled more stringent measures on Monday, including the banning of religious services and the closure of hotels.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-15;Swiss parliament interrupts spring session over coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-parliament-interrupts-spring-session-over--rapidly-worsening--coronavirus-situation/45618696;"Parliament is cutting short the ongoing work in its two chambers – House of Representatives and Senate - due to the “rapidly worsening” coronavirus situation in Switzerland.  The spring session of parliament began on March 2 and was due to run for another week from March 16. But due to the “rapidly worsening coronavirus situation” the presidents of the House of Representatives and Senate parliamentary groups decided to interrupt work at the request of the administrative delegation, parliament announced on Twitter on March 15.  The Keystone-SDA News agency confirmed that the presidents discussed the situation on Sunday during a telephone conversation.  Senate President Hans Stöckli told Swiss public radio, SRF;   We have no business that makes it necessary for us to meet...but the situation is serious. Various requests had been made by parliamentarians to suspend the spring session two weeks ago but it had gone ahead nonetheless. Special measures had been introduced to prevent transmissions. Stöckli said a special session is already planned for early May. In addition, a session could be convened at any time if the Federal Council needed parliamentary decisions. Switzerland is one of the countries most affected by the coronavirus worldwide, with over 1,500 confirmed cases and 14 deaths.   On March 13, the Swiss government imposed sweeping measures on March 13, including closing schools across the country until at least April 4 (some cantons have longer closures until April 30), banning public gatherings of more than 100 people, limiting access to restaurants, bars and discos to a maximum of 50 people and pledging CHF10 billion to help the economy.  Cantons Ticino, Basel Country and Jura have introduced tighter measures to combat the spread of the virus.

2020-03-15;An international virus needs an international response ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_international-response-required-for-covid-19/45618148;"On the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, the Covid-19 pandemic poses a crucial moment for the international system, writes Daniel Warner. Newton’s third law of motion says that for every action there is a reaction. While many of the 17th century English physicist’s laws have been replaced by modern science, his third law has important implications for today’s coronavirus outbreak. We know the virus exists. It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health OrganizationExternal link (WHO). What we don’t know is how to react to the virus.  There have been several levels of reaction. On a personal level, we are told to wash our hands frequently, and to avoid large gatherings, shaking hands and kissing. Older people and those with pre-existing chronic health problems should be especially careful. Beyond the personal level, what has been the larger reaction to the pandemic? It should first be noted that all eyes have turned to public authorities. We are dependent on what governments tell us. They can close schools, shut borders, and forbid intercontinental flights as they wish. We citizens have nothing to say in the matter. Even in democracies, there is no vote on how to react to a health crisis. (A financial crisis is another matter with legislative branches having input into executive decisions.)  Moreover, in an era of privatization and scepticism about government efficiency, no private company has come forward to supersede governments. There may be public-private partnerships about manufacturing testing kits, but governments are in charge. The public sector is the recognized authority during the crisis.  What public sector? In federations there are local, regional and national levels. But it is the national level that has the highest authority in emergencies. No mayor or state governor, for example, can overturn President Trump’s decision about Europeans entering the United States. It is in his power to decide as US president.  And beyond the national? What about the multilateral? As French President Emmanuel Macron said in his address to the nation, the virus knows no borders; it needs no passport or visa to enter a country. Macron recognized that there must be a coordinated response beyond borders to the pandemic.  Why hasn’t there been an international meeting to coordinate responses? The WHO has played an important role in describing what is going on. It became the recognized source of international information. That’s not bad considering other UN agencies are having their authority questioned. But the WHO has little operational power.  A coordinated, multilateral international response is missing. For that, there must be leadership. Why hasn’t the United States called for an emergency meeting of heads of state to see how they could work together instead of or at the same time as closing down the country? The US did exercise international leadership in the Ebola crisis and the 2008 stock market crash.   Coordinating does not mean that each country cannot decide for itself, it just means that decisions are made in conjunction with others. President Macron did say he would speak with President Trump. Did President Trump consult with other heads of state before closing down visitors from Europe?  The history of multilateralism began with ad hoc cooperation to solve specific problems. The Rhine Regime started in the 19th century to deal with transportation issues on the river. The Universal Postal Union was formed in 1874 so that letters could get from one country to another. Cooperation was necessary.   The Covid-19 is a pandemic. Only multilateral cooperation can deal with a global problem. For the moment, we are mostly seeing local and national reactions. If the pandemic is global, the only way to deal with it is global, i.e. multilateral.   In a moment of pronounced nationalism, that may be hard to do, especially with little leadership. But, going back to Newton, a global action requires a global reaction. The UN’s 75th anniversary should be a reminder of that.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

This year’s festival took place online because of coronavirus outbreak. The Bucharest-born filmmaker was awarded the Geneva Grand Prix, offered by the city and canton, and a CHF10,000 prize. His critically acclaimed documentaryExternal link follows a team of sports journalists investigating the 2015 fire at the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest, which killed 27 people and injured 180. Fierce protests later broke out when 37 of the people injured subsequently died from bacterial infections. The film uncovers high-level government corruption within the Ministry of Health.  In all, the FIFDH External linkawarded prizes for a total of thirteen documentary and fiction films.  The Gilda Vieira de Mello prize, and CHF5,000, went to Silence Radio , by Juliana Fanjul, which also addresses the issue of corruption. The international jury, led by American filmmaker and activist Pamela Yates, also awarded a special mention to Gaza by Garry Keane and Andrew McConnel. In fiction, Maternal by Maura Delpero won the Grand Prix and CHF10,000.  The World Organisation Against Torture awarded its prize for the best TV documentary report to Assistance to a person in danger: a crime by Pietro Boschetti and Frank Preiswerk, which looks at Swiss policy on illegal migration. The coronavirus pandemic forced the FIFDH organisers to suddenly cancel all public events and screenings and to offer online programming from March 6-15. A total of 27 debates and major interviews were nonetheless broadcast on the festival's website and other platforms, which generated over 55,000 views on YouTube and Facebook.

Army chief Thomas Süessli said the deployment was a “special service towards the service and protection of us all”. Since March 9, the army has already sent 23 people to support two hospitals at Bellinzona and Lugano in canton Ticino, in southern Switzerland bordering Italy. They are helping look after patients and provide materials, which includes respiratory devices. But the army believes other cantons will soon request additional support. It is unclear how many army personnel will be deployed but several hundred are expected, according to an army spokesperson. The virus is spreading throughout Switzerland. More than 1,500 cases were reported as of March 15 by federal authorities, as well as 14 deaths. Most victims were elderly people with pre-existing health conditions.   The pressure on the health system is also growing. In Switzerland there are 82 intensive care units with 950 to 1,000 beds, around 850 of which are equipped with respirators. The army has around 200 additional respirators.

2020-03-15;Swiss International Air Lines hopes to receive state aid over coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-ceo-hopes-to-receive-state-aid-over-coronavirus/45618194;The boss of Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) says he hopes the Swiss state will step in to help it deal with the impact of the novel coronavirus.  “I count on the fact that the Federal Council is aware of the importance of SWISS,” Chief Executive Officer Thomas Klühr told the Sonntagsblick newspaper on March 15. Major US and European airlines have begun talks with governments on obtaining financial aid to weather a crippling travel slump brought on by the coronavirus, which has hobbled global travel and is threatening thousands of industry jobs. The Lufthansa subsidiary has taken half its fleet out of service and reduced working hours for flight personnel to help safeguard its finances during the coronavirus outbreak. According to Klühr, no airline could survive the coronavirus without state aid. If the situation worsens, SWISS would have to ground all of its planes and would thus be dependent on state aid, he went on.  But the CEO said he was confident that the airline would survive this crisis. “I am sure that we can hold out longer than other airlines,” he declared. But that will depend on help from the federal authorities, he said, without giving any figures.  The Swiss federal authorities are aware of the extent of the problems facing the airline. Economics Minister declared on Sunday that the State Secretariat for the Economy (SECO) had been in close contact with the airline and the Zurich cantonal authorities to offer its support to the company and its staff.  “If other measures are necessary, we will examine the question with SWISS,” said Parmelin. Talks between SWISS and the Swiss government are due to take place next week.                      Fall in demand  On Friday, the Lufthansa subsidiary said that to compensate for the sharp fall in demand and resultant lost revenue, the airline had decided to take immediate further precautionary action to secure liquidity. Payout of variable salary components would be postponed to the end of this year for both flying personnel and senior management, the airline said, adding all recruitment besides apprentices and interns would also be halted and all non-essential projects halted or postponed.  SWISS said it was in contact with authorities and would initially apply for short-time working hours for cockpit and cabin staff, and was also considering such measures for workers on the ground. SWISS has reduced or cancelled flights to and from areas with a particular risk of infection, including Beijing and Shanghai (China), as well as to and from Tel Aviv (Israel), Cairo (Egypt), Bordeaux (France), Stuttgart and Nuremberg (Germany). SWISS has also suspended flights to and from all destinations in neighbouring Italy until the beginning of April. It has also reduced flights to the United States to just Chicago and Newark following a US ban on Schengen zone travellers.  On October 2, 2001, the national carrier Swissair collapsed under a mountain of debts, sparking national anger and soul searching. Its successor SWISS was rescued by Germany’s Lufthansa group in 2005. The Swiss government is the single biggest shareholder in the airline with a 20.4% stake.

2020-03-14;Media praise Swiss government’s coronavirus response;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_media-praise-swiss-government-s-coronavirus-response/45617020;The press has largely welcomed special measures introduced by the Federal Council on Friday to contain the spread of coronavirus in Switzerland. Editorials urged the population to follow federal health recommendations and to show solidarity.  The Confederation is not abandoning its population. It wants to protect them. With strong measures. The most spectacular, of course, is the closure of all schools. This is shocking, but now essential to stop the disease,” declared the Le Temps daily on March 14. The previous day the government imposed sweeping measures, including closing schools across the country until at least April 4 (some cantons have longer closures until April 30), banning public gatherings of more than 100 people, limiting access to restaurants, bars and discos to a maximum of 50 people and pledging CHF10 billion to help the economy.  Until now, the crisis regime has given the cantons too much freedom from the coronavirus, while in fact imposing too much responsibility on them. The new rules ensure greater unity and efficiency in the response to the pandemic,” said the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper, adding that the government should perhaps have gone further in its response.  In times of crisis, it's important to keep a cool head. And, if necessary, act with great determination, wrote the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ). This is exactly what the Federal Council has done and continues to do. The federal government is proving that it can lead the country in an emergency and that it is prepared to take courageous, even difficult decisions when necessary.”  The Fribourg-based La Liberté echoed this: The Confederation has realised the gravity of the situation. It's about time, some people say.” However, it was not all praise. The 24-Heures newspaper noted that “despite the many preparatory meetings between Bern and the cantons, there is still a certain cacophony and an overcomplicated situation. Given the exceptional crisis, the slowness of federalism reveals certain limits and paradoxes .  La Liberté agreed that there were several visible cracks in national unity, with the cantons and the Confederation diverging on the duration of the restrictions and the size of authorised gatherings. It concluded that in the face of a global pandemic, federalism is definitely an outdated remedy .  The Tribune de Genève said the main difficulty for the population was not necessarily the actual measures but that almost every day new decisions were being announced. “As soon as one adapts to the current situation, it becomes obsolete, the paper said. In its editorial the German-language Blick tabloid recalled that it was important for the public understand exactly why the government was introducing such extraordinary measures. “It is a drastic act which ultimately means showing solidarity. Solidarity with people who could be threatened by the coronavirus, it said.  Tribune de Genève concurred: “By taking firm measures, the Confederation and the canton are trying to shorten the time of crisis. This is a good strategy, but only on one condition: that everyone plays their part. Otherwise, a much more serious economic and social disaster is on the horizon.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-14;Swiss ski resorts still operating told to ‘close immediately’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_swiss-ski-resorts-still-operating-told-to--close-immediately-/45616882;The Federal Office of Public Health (OFSP) has told any ski resorts still open to the public this weekend that they should “close immediately” in line with the government’s emergency coronavirus measures announced on Friday. On March 13, the government imposed sweeping measures to contain the spread of coronavirus in Switzerland. These included banning public or private gatherings with over 100 persons. This applies to leisure and recreational facilities, museums, sports centres, cinemas, swimming pools and ski resorts, the government said. However, while many resorts have ceased operations, some are still partly open, the health office said on SaturdayExternal link. In some cantons, the new ordinance is being interpreted differently for ski resorts, it said. “The Federal Council maintains its position: the measures decided upon also apply to recreational facilities such as ski resorts. Ski resorts as well as other entertainment and leisure facilities with more than 100 people at a time are to be closed. If the operators cannot guarantee compliance with this requirement, ski resorts must cease operations immediately,” it said. “The Federal Office of Public Health asks those that are still open to close immediately.” Swiss public radio, SRF, said ski lifts and cable cars in the Jungfrau region and in Gstaad  in central Switzerland were still operating on Saturday, as well as the Titlis. Howver, SRF said ski resorts in cantons Graubünden and Valais had closed.  The virus is spreading throughout Switzerland. More than 1,100 cases were reported as of March 14 by federal authorities, as well as 11 deaths.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-13;Switzerland imposes sweeping measures to contain coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-acts_switzerland-imposes-sweeping-measures-to-contain-coronavirus/45615344;Switzerland has closed schools throughout the country and imposed a ban on public gatherings of more than 100 people. The government pledged CHF10 billion ($10.6 billion) in emergency aid to support the economy and re-introduced in principle border checks with neighbouring countries. The package of measures External linkwas announced at a news conference attended by four of the seven government ministers on Friday. The ban on gatherings will last until at least the end of April while schools will be closed until April 4 (some cantons have bans until April 30). The border with Italy will remain open but further restrictions will be applied. Furthermore, border controls with other European countries have been tightened with a suspension of the single border agreement. Switzerland is not a member state of the European Union but is included in the Schengen zone. The CHF10 billion ($10.6 billion) aid package is aimed at helping companies survive the economic downturn caused by coronavirus. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin said  most of the money (CHF8 billion) was earmarked to fund the imposition of short-time work at firms while other tranches have been set aside for hardship loans and to support specific sectors such as event management. In comparison, Switzerland's overall budget for 2020 approved by parliament in December amounts to CHF75 billion. The situation is serious but there is no reason to panic, said President Simonetta Sommaruga at the news conference. We have the medical and financial means to cope with the difficult situation, she said. Sommaruga said the new action plan was aimed at protecting the population and helping the business community hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. The new measures are far-reaching but we need them and we need the solidarity of the population, she added. Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose portfolio includes health matters, said social distancing is the most efficient way of stemming the spread of the virus. He said it was key to protect the vulnerable groups of society, notably the elderly and the infirm and to avoid a collapse of the healthcare system.  Berset said the national government is working with the 26 cantons - which have a large degree of autonomy - to ensure that the health infrastructure can cope with the increased demand from coronavirus. The government has also asked citizens to avoiding public transport during rush hours and ordered a ban on regular school lessons - in an apparent policy change. Berset explained a new report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and ControlExternal link (ECDC) had prompted the government to reconsider its position. However, the government stopped short of closing down restaurants, bars and discos, but it limited access to a maximum of 50 people at any one time. It's not the moment for big parties, said Berset, appealing notably to the younger generation to contribute to the efforts of society. He said the government is aware the measures will slow down daily life in Switzerland considerably over the next few weeks. The health of the population is a priority, he said. The nationwide measures, which the government can impose under the terms of the Epidemics Act, have been mirrored in part already in some cantons. Ticino, which borders Italy, has already banned events and restricted restaurants, nightclubs and bars. By Friday, several cantons had already decided to shut down schools. Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the travel restrictions from Italy were aimed at preventing Italian patients from seeking access to Swiss hospitals. However, Swiss citizens, holders of a resident permit as well as cross-border workers and people transiting through Switzerland are still allowed to enter the country. However, asylum seekers are also subject to the restrictions.  Keller-Sutter said she had notified the EU of the Swiss action plan earlier on Friday.  It's the second package of measures by the Swiss government, following a first action plan announced last month. It included a ban on events with more than 1,000 people. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-13;Austria reintroduces border controls with Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-effect_austria-closes-border-with-switzerland/45615144;Austria has reintroduced border controls with Switzerland and Liechtenstein, while banning flights from Switzerland, Spain and France, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.   The Austrian government announced the move on Friday, saying it will take effect from the beginning of next week. Austria had previously introduced similar border measures with another neighbouring country, Italy. Swiss travelers are already being rejected by the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Serbia on a temporary basis. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has risen to more than a thousand in Switzerland with seven confirmed deaths by Friday afternoon. Austria’s tightened border is part of a package of measures introduced by the government, including a quarantine of two regions, the closure of bars, restaurants, cafés and non-essential shops plus a recommendation that all people should work from home if possible.

2020-03-13;Volunteers open doors to cross-border health workers ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19-solidarity-_volunteers-open-doors-to-cross-border-health-workers-/45614860;Many people in the Ticino region have opened their homes to cross-border health workers from neighbouring Italy. It has become increasingly difficult for Italians to commute to work and back across the border after Italian authorities imposed measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. News of the lock down in Italy’s northern Lombardy region last Saturday, March 7, did not take long to spread on social media, even before it was announced officially.   Predictably, the news also began to spread in the Italian-speaking Ticino region across the Swiss border. One of the immediate concerns was how the canton’s hospitals and homes could cope without the Italian cross-border workers.   There are nearly 70,000 people from northern Italy who enter Switzerland for work every day, including some 4,000 employees in the Ticino health sector. So measures to stem the spread of the virus could be counter-productive and shut out precisely these employees.   It did not take long either for the first signs of solidarity to be published on Facebook.   “I offer free accommodation for personnel in the medical/ healthcare sector who need to stay in our canton,” reads a message posted over the weekend.   One of the people behind this solidarity initiative is Nevia Elezovic. She created a Facebook group C’è posto per teExternal link (There’s a place for you to stay) with a site compiling all the offers for temporary accommodation.  “Regardless of how the situation develops, I have decided to be part of the solution rather than the problem,” Elezovic told tvsvizzera.it.   “If I feel the need to help, maybe others will feel the same. I discussed this with a friend and with my mother, who works as a nurse at an old people’s home. And the solution seemed obvious: We should offer what we have, and what we have is a house.”   A Facebook group seemed to be the best way of getting the message to a broad potential audience. “We have to make sure the message gets to the right people,” says Elezovic.   This private initiative appears to have been quite efficient. Twenty-four hours after creating the Facebook group on Wednesday, some 50 offers had been published on the site.   Some of the offers also came from people who – under normal circumstances – make a financial profit in the hospitality sector.   For example, Carla Giusto runs a B&B in the town of Locarno and is offering three rooms. “I’m from Venice and I told myself this is a perfect opportunity to help Switzerland, the country which has adopted me,” she says.  She believes that the Swiss authorities are a bit slow in taking the necessary measures compared with the situation in Venice.   “I hope they will act quickly now, because this is a real crisis. But I’m confident that if everybody contributes and acts responsibly, we will cope,” she says.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-13;Switzerland closes its schools to slow virus spread;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_switzerland-closes-its-schools-to-slow-virus-spread/45614324;On March 13, the Swiss government announced the temporary closure of schools and universities nationwide to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. In so doing, Bern caved in to growing calls for closures and followed the example of other European countries.  Around the world, 39 countries have so far announced or implemented nationwide shutdowns of their schools or universities in a bid to contain the virus, according to UnescoExternal link, affecting over 420 million students. That number is widely expected to increase.  Italy, one of the most severely affected countries, has closed all schools amid a wider nationwide lockdown. France announced on March 12 that it would shut its schools, nurseries and universities from March 16. Austria also ordered its schools closed. In Germany, Saarland has become the first state to order closures. In Switzerland, the authorities were initially hesitant to close schools, Interior Minister Alain Berset said at a press conference on March 13.   The authorities had reasoned that the elderly were most at risk of falling seriously ill after contracting the virus, according to the first studies of the Covid-19 disease. Children appear to be less at risk. Because childcare is often left to retired grandparents, potentially infected children staying with their grandparents would have exposed more elderly people to the risk of contagion. This calculation changed on March 13. Berset explained that a new report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and ControlExternal link (ECDC) had prompted the government to reconsider its position. The Federal Council told reporters on March 13 that schools would be closed at least until April 4. Cantons Vaud, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Valais went further by announcing longer closures until April 30. Distance learning is being offered to students, but this is still being sorted out. Scheduled exams will nonetheless go ahead with schools taking appropriate protective measures. The umbrella organisation representing teachers in Switzerland (LCH) said the nationwide school closure was a logical step .  But the news, which had been expected, still came as a shock to many parents and teachers who will have to suddenly reorganise their work and teaching schedules. For families where there may be a risk of inter-generational transmission of the virus, or for parents who are health or nursery workers, schools may open special classrooms for reduced numbers of students. Meanwhile, some parents have already set up Whatsapp and Facebook groups to help each other find solutions. Education is the responsibility of the cantons in Switzerland, so normally cantons would decide about closures. The epidemics law allows the Swiss government to step in to strongly suggest and even order a blanket or partial school system shut down.   The Federal Council said that the decision of closing nurseries would be left to the cantons.   The closures on March 13 included higher education and training institutionsExternal link. “From this evening, Friday 13 March, until the end of April, the University of Lausanne (UNIL) will operate with resources reduced to the bare essentials. Students and staff are required to stay off campus. The buildings will be closed. Access to the campus will be restricted to staff whose presence is required for essential tasks and to faculty members whose presence is required for essential tasks,” the UNIL website saidExternal link. The Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne have moved to offer some classes online (EPFL until April 19, ETH Zurich until the end of the semester).   Other universities, such as Lucerne, Geneva and Bern, have also announced to expand their digital offerings and remote lectures.   The ETH Zurich has had one known infection as of Friday. The University of Zurich recorded 10 cases by March 10, when it last shared such information.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-13;What can Switzerland do to slow the spread of Covid-19?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-measures_what-can-switzerland-do-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19-/45614250;After the country’s hardest-hit canton took the unusual step of imposing emergency measures as part of a “state of necessity”, the Swiss public has been divided about how far authorities can, and should, go to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.  Here’s a look at the options available to the cantons and the federal government.  As so often in Switzerland, the answer is: it’s complicated as cantonal authorities have much autonomy in deciding the steps they should take.  But the severity of the outbreak has pushed the cantons to coordinate their efforts more closely and follow federal recommendations.  A major benefit of cantonal legislation is that it allows them to take targeted measures locally, but in the case of a pandemic like the one we are experiencing now, these piecemeal measures can risk causing confusion and diverging standards.  In 2012, the federal parliament in Bern passed the Epidemics Act to give the federal government more leeway and guarantee that the cantons act in unison in case of such a situation. The new coronavirus is the first time these provisions have been put to the test.  Under the law, the Federal Council may proclaim two situations: a “special situation” (Art. 6) and an “extraordinary situation”.  The special situation status was declared two weeks ago. It is triggered by a risk of serious consequences for the economy and public health. It can decree some measures that are normally a prerogative of the cantons, but these measures have to be taken in consultation with the cantons. The federal government instituted a nationwide ban on larger gatherings people or more under these parameters, and taken some other measures.  It can reduce the number of people allowed to attend gatherings, it can close schools and universities and other public and private institutions. In an “extraordinary situation”, the government could take additional measures for parts or the entirety of the national territory. The prior consultations with cantons would no longer be required and cantons would simply execute the federal government’s decisions. It could also restrict movements in parts of the country. When the federal government declared the outbreak a “special situation”, it banned large gatherings. The cantons followed suit with stricter rules.  On Wednesday, Ticino went the furthestExternal link by declaring a “state of necessity” that was meant to curb social life significantly and it even closed some smaller border posts to Italy.  On Friday, Switzerland has closed schools throughout the country and imposed a ban on public gatherings of more than 100 people. Bars and restaurants are limited to 50 guests while the government pledged CHF10 billion ($10.6 billion) in emergency aid to support the economy. + Switzerland imposes sweeping measures to contain coronavirusExternal link The federal authorities have also issued varying sets of recommendations to the public. The first set of recommendations issued by the public health office relates to hygiene, such as washing hands thoroughly. As the outbreak spread, the authorities also recommended social distancing and self-isolation for at-risk people, people with virus symptoms or anyone who has been in contact with infected people.   Art. 185 of the federal constitutionExternal link gives the Federal Council the ability to safeguard national security and deal with “imminent disruptions of public order” by taking measures and ordinances.  It may even mobilise up to 4,000 troops for up to three weeks. Parliament would need to approve longer or broader measures. This happened during the Second World War.  But the invocation of Art. 185 seems unlikely as officials reiterate that the Epidemics Act provides for all the necessary procedures to deal with the pandemic.

2020-03-13;Ticino closes all schools to contain coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/extraordinary-measures_ticino-closes-all-schools-to-contain-coronavirus/45614190;Canton Ticino, which borders Italy, has extended its emergency measures to combat the spread of coronavirus by closing down all schools, including compulsory education establishments. The announcement on Friday follows a series of measures taken earlier in the week as the canton declared a “state of necessity”, giving the authorities power to act in the interests of public health. Cantons Vaud and Fribourg also announced similar measures. This was followed by a nationwide closure of schools until April 4. In Switzerland, education is the responsibility of the cantons, so they can make decisions over school closures. However, the epidemics lawExternal link would allow the government to step in and order blanket or partial school shut downs if necessary. Ticino is one of the worst affected cantons from the coronavirus outbreak. The authorities have already shuttered cinemas, ski resorts, gyms, nightclubs and non-compulsory schools. From Monday, all schools from kindergarten to secondary level will be suspended. The authorities said school buildings would be used to establish day care facilities for children. Among the 12 measures already introduced in Ticino is one that discourages people over 65 from looking after children or taking public transport. Events with more than 50 people have also been prohibited. The border between Switzerland and Italy remains open to accommodate the 68,000 workers that make the crossing every day. But several smaller border crossing points were closed down on Wednesday. Air and rail transport links between the two countries have also been restricted. Switzerland’s prestigious Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne (ETHZ and EPFL) have separately decided to suspend all classroom teaching for the remainder of the semester, which ends on May 29. The universities will temporarily switch to a distance learning model. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-13;Coronavirus: ‘Fears, rumours and stigma’ cause bullying in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_coronavirus---fears--rumours-and-stigma--cause-bullying-in-switzerland/45614186;"A Taiwanese student at the University of Lucerne recounts how she was mocked for being Asian amid the coronavirus outbreak.  Despite the concerns around the spread of the coronavirus, what has affected me most is not the virus itself, but the fears, rumours and stigma against Asians because of it. Since the outbreak of coronavirus, I have heard many racist stories against Asians from those around me and on the news. But I had never personally experienced it until last Saturday.   I was in downtown Lucerne at the Theaterplatz in the early afternoon. As I walked past a group of local senior citizens, they loudly and dramatically shouted, “Be careful! Be careful!”  The person closest to me pretended to walk away from me as I was approaching. They were laughing the whole time. I didn’t realise their actions were aimed at me until I noticed they were all waiting for my response.   I stopped, looked at them and asked, “Seriously? You do that just for fun?” They kept laughing. They neither apologised nor expressed regret for their behaviour.    Judging by their appearance, they seemed to be educated seniors. I’m shocked that even at their age they are still making jokes based on discrimination, regardless of how it makes others feel. Even when I threatened to report their behaviour, they didn’t care and showed no sign of empathy.  What hurt me more is that when I told my friends about the incident, they told me about similar situations, most of which happened in school against kids who are of Asian descent but who are Swiss. They were bullied because of their appearance.  Bullying should not be tolerated. In fact, residents of Switzerland are protected under its anti-discrimination lawExternal link, which forbids specific, severe forms of racism including public incitement of hatred or discrimination; systematic denigration or defamation; and violations of human dignity, whether verbally, in writing or pictorially, by using gestures, through acts of aggression or by other means.  Swiss criminal law protects people from all forms of discrimination. For example, it is a crime to insult a person or group of people on the grounds of race, gender or religion, and on the basis of sexual orientation, which a recent referendum confirmed. Swiss law also states that freedom of speech ends once another protected right is infringed, in this case the right to human dignity.   People need to show sympathy and respect to others; this is what we need the most now. Bullies must also be reminded that justice can also come via the law if they don’t change their behaviour. For those who suffer from any kind of bullying, especially vulnerable groups like minorities and children, I encourage them to stay strong and, if necessary, seek legal means to protect their right to human dignity.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo.ch.

2020-03-12;Coronavirus decimates Swiss stocks;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus-decimates-swiss-stock-exchange/45613322;The Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended Thursday down 9.64% on 8,270 points, having broken the 10% mark just before the close of trading. There was red across the boardExternal link, with banks and insurance companies doing the most damage.  Credit Suisse finished the day down 16%, Swiss Re down 15.6%, Swiss Life down 14.8% and UBS down 13.2%.  A similarly large intraday loss was last seen in 2015, when the Swiss National Bank (SNB) scrapped a cap on the euro exchange rate. The SMIExternal link, first published on July 1, 1988, did not exist during the biggest stock market crash of the post-war period on October 19, 1987, when speculation on interest rate hikes caused the Dow Jones Index on Wall Street to collapse by 23%.  The following is an overview of the SMI’s highest percentage losses since then:  October 16, 1989: The SMI falls by 11%, following Wall Street, where financing difficulties in a company sale trigger a crash.  August 19, 1991: A coup against the then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, which later failed, pushes the SMI down by a good 8%.  October 28, 1997: In the wake of the Asian crisis, the SMI plummets by more than 10% during trading, closing 4.6% lower.  October 1, 1998: Fears of a conflagration in the banking sector following the collapse of a hedge fund and an escalation of the crises in Asia, Japan, Latin America and Russia push the SMI down by almost 6%.  September 11, 2001: Following the terrorist attacks in the US, the SMI falls by around 7%.  September 21, 2001: Ten days later, stock markets worldwide hit the lowest levels for several years. In the meantime, the SMI plummets by almost 8%. Investors are no longer only afraid of growing economic risks and the financial damage caused by terrorism in many sectors but also of a possible war.  January 21, 2008: Fears of a recession in the US push the SMI into negative territory by over 5%.  September 15, 2008: The SMI falls by 5.4% following the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers. By the end of trading it recovers somewhat, closing 3.8 % lower.  October 8, 2008: In the wake of the financial crisis, the SMI loses up to 6.6%. Following a concerted round of interest rate cuts by the major central banks, share prices recover only slightly. The SMI closes down 5.5%.  October 24, 2008: Another crash on the Tokyo stock exchange pushes the SMI down by over 8% at its lowest.  January 15, 2015: The SNB lifts the minimum euro exchange rate. With an interim fall of 13.8%, the SMI experiences its biggest daily loss to date, falling from over 9,000 points the previous evening to below 8,000 points. It closes 8.7% lower. The following day it falls by a further 6%.  August 24, 2015: Fears of a significant economic slump in China depress the SMI by 7.3%. Speculation on a cash injection from the Chinese central bank slows the slide in the evening. The SMI ends the day down 3.7%.  June 24, 2016: After Britain votes to leave the EU the SMI nosedives by 6.8% and closes 3.4% lower.  February 24, 2020: A new coronavirus spreads to Europe. Fear of the consequences of the epidemic puts an end to the SMI’s soaring rise and it falls by 4%. Only shortly before the SMI had reached a record high of 11,270 points.  March 9, 2020: In addition to the general uncertainty caused by Covid-19, there is also an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. This pushes the SMI down by 7% or almost 700 points in the course of trading. Stock markets around the world collapse.  March 12, 2020: The stock markets are again in free fall due to the general uncertainty around the coronavirus. Neither an interest rate decision by the European Central Bank nor communicated measures to stabilise the economy calm the markets.

2020-03-12;Swiss cantons expected to follow Ticino’s lead in emergency measures ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-_state-of-emergency-likely-for-all-of-switzerland/45612210;​​​​​​​ The federal health office said on Thursday that emergency measures introduced in Ticino on Wednesday could soon be extended to the rest of Switzerland.  Already on Wednesday, the southernmost canton of Ticino declared a state of necessity , which comprises a series of emergency measures, including the closure of some schools, on account of the coronavirus pandemic. These will be in effect until the end of March.  “The rest of Switzerland will certainly do what’s being done in Ticino now. The wave has now arrived in Switzerland,” Daniel Koch, the head of infectious diseases at the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link told Swiss public radio, SRFExternal link.  He reiterated the importance of protecting the elderly and the chronically ill. “Because for them the virus is dangerous. They need hospitals. And if there are too many patients, the hospitals will not be able to cope with the situation.” Koch later clarified that such decisions would be taken on a cantonal, not a federal level.  Among the 12 measures introduced in Ticino is one that discourages people over 65 from looking after children or taking public transport. Restaurants have also been told to limit seatings to 50 people maximum. The shut-down does not affect higher education or vocational training establishments. Also on Wednesday, the Swiss government closed nine border crossing points to Italy – where there are over 12,000 cases and more than 800 people have died. The move is designed to better control and monitor the influx of workers from its southern neighbour. However, the government has resisted closing down the border altogether. Clarification: An earlier version of this story referred to the emergency measures as a state of emergency, whereas the Ticino authorities have described the emergency measures as being part of a  state of necessity . ​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-12;‘Desperate measures in desperate times’ as virus affects International Geneva;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-impact_-desperate-measures-in-desperate-times--as-virus-affects-international-geneva/45607166;Geneva has been at the sharp end of the disruption caused by the new coronavirus. After the motor show, the list of cancelled or postponed conferences and meetings in Switzerland’s most international city continues to grow.  While the coronavirus figures for Geneva remain relatively low –  78 confirmed cases and no deaths at the time of writing – the impact on activities in the international city, a global governance hub that claims to be the world’s biggest centre for international conferences, has been considerable.  The motor showExternal link (600,000 visitors), an inventions fairExternal link (50,000), and a human rights film festivalExternal link (40,000) were among the first local casualties of the global outbreak and Swiss ban on major events. This list has been extended with the cancellation of 200 side events at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Geneva Brain WeekExternal link, and postponements of the Geneva Health ForumExternal link, the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) ForumExternal link, the AI for Good Global SummitExternal link, and the ILO Governing Body meetingExternal link, which together attract thousands of international visitors. On March 10, World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced External linkthat all meetings at WTO would be suspended from March 11-20. This follows confirmation that a WTO Secretariat staff member had contracted coronavirus. The International Labour Organization (ILO) said on March 12 that a probable case had also been identified at its headquarters. The staff member is staying at home to recover while areas of the HQ are being disinfected. The Conference on Disarmament (CD) meetings and regular debates for the 43rd session of the UN Human Rights Council (February 24-March 20) had been continuing, but on March 12 the human rights council agreed to suspend the 43rd session on Friday March 13 until further notice , and the CD announced the same day that its next two plenary sessions in March would be postponed. The decisions came a day after Geneva authorities tightened its rules, saying that public meetings in the Swiss city should be limited to 100 people.  In the corridors of the historic Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the UN, work appears to go on, but there is none of the hustle-and-bustle typical for this time of year and anxiety surrounding the virus is palpable. Public visits to the complex have been stopped. Behind the scenes, UN officials have been scrambling to set up crisis management structures, coordinate with other members of the UN system, informExternal link and reassure staff and event organisers at the Palais, and put in place contingency plans. Bottles of sanitizer are made available at meetings and organisers have been told to make sure participants do not sit closer than two metres for periods longer than 15 minutes. “We are trying to maintain essential UN activities as much as possible,” explained Rhéal Leblanc, head of press and external relations at the UN Office in Geneva. “Everyone is trying to make alternative arrangements like using video-conferencing or remote meetings and everyone is doing risk assessments while heeding the recommendations of the Swiss authorities and World Health Organization (WHO).”   The ten biggest international organisations in Geneva seem to be implementing similar measures, in close collaboration with the WHO and Swiss authorities. Beyond risk evaluations, these include practical steps like setting up intranet pages and other information on preventive measures, offering guidance and updates on work and travel arrangements and “safe distancing”. The use of video-conferencing and virtual meetings has been widely encouraged, where possible, with staff in field offices working from home for periods. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), for example, has suspended all non-essential travel until April 15. This has affected all training sessions, workshops, and seminars requiring international travel. The decision to cancel 200 Human Rights Council side events organised this month by NGOs and states has affected over 1,000 participants, many travelling to Geneva from other countries.  Council spokesperson Rolando Gomez described it as a “desperate measure in desperate times”.  “It’s frustrating and not very helpful for NGOs,” a human rights activist told swissinfo.ch. “This is the main session when many people from the field come to Geneva to talk to the states. It’s important and here they’re being denied that opportunity.” But Gomez added that the decision had been well thought out. “It’s not just about participants in Geneva getting affected, but it’s also about potentially mitigating the risk of the virus being exported back to countries with weaker health systems,” he said. In the face of the coronavirus threat, the UN is not enforcing travel restrictions, instead leaving it down to individual responsibility. Participants at meetings from coronavirus-risk countries may be asked about their itinerary to Geneva but they are still allowed to attend. Leblanc said appropriate safeguards had been put in place and the global body was doing its utmost to “preserve people’s health given the circumstances”, but “we don’t have the facilities to screen people”, he added. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)External link, for its part, has postponed its two big upcoming meetings – the WSIS and AI for Good conferences – until later in the year. But it has advised visitors to the ITU from affected countries, or anyone having visited an affected area during the previous two weeks before attending an ITU event, that they will get their temperature checked and may be turned away. All delegates will have to provide information on places visited to help with Covid-19 tracing. Asked about the general impact of the virus on International Geneva, Paola Ceresetti, spokesperson for the Swiss mission to the UN in Geneva, said international organisations were managing to “ensure continuity of work” while implementing measures to protect the health of staff.  “In general, in accordance with the UN secretary-general’s recommendations, meetings are taking place with Geneva-based staff and diplomats, thus limiting the travel and arrival of delegations from foreign capitals to Geneva to what is strictly necessary,” she added.

2020-03-12;Serbia closes borders to coronavirus-affected states, including Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_serbia-closes-borders-to-coronavirus-affected-states--including-switzerland/45608316;Serbia closed its borders on Tuesday for travellers from countries most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, including Switzerland, to prevent spreading of the disease, the government said in a statement.  The temporary ban applies to people arriving “from Italy, certain provinces in China, South Korea, Iran and parts of Switzerland”, it saidExternal link. The government did not say when the ban would be lifted. On March 12, the Serbian embassy in Bern issued a statement External linkin which it clarified that for China, South Korea and Switzerland the ban applies exclusively to the persons coming from the Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, the city of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang Province of the Republic of Korea and the Canton of Ticino in Switzerland. The temporary ban on entry into Serbia for foreign nationals coming from Italy and the Islamic Republic of Iran remains in effect, it said. The embassy said the airlines Air Serbia and Swiss had currently blocked flights from Switzerland to Serbia. International road traffic is being diverted to major border crossings, whereas 44 smaller and occasional border crossings will be temporarily closed. So far, 12 people in Serbia have tested positive for the coronavirus. There are over 600 known cases in Switzerland, and four confirmed deaths. The government urges Serbian citizens who work abroad and come from the areas with intense coronavirus transmission, and plan to come to Serbia for the upcoming Easter holidays, to delay the trip, the Serbian embassy statement went on. Officially, some 71,000 people of Serbian origin live in Switzerland (2015 figure) while around 2,300 Swiss live in Serbia – many with dual nationality.  Last week, Israel also ordered travellers arriving from Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain and Austria to go into home quarantine, as it had already done for those returning from Italy, China and Singapore. Swiss International Airlines cancelled flights to Tel Aviv until the end of the month.  In Europe, Austria unilaterally broke with the European Union’s rules on the free movement of people on Tuesday by denying entry to those arriving from Italy. This is the first case of restrictions being placed on the free travel Schengen area of 26 European countries since the outbreak of the virus, an echo of 2015, when a wave of migrants and refugees prompted several to close their borders. It is also the first time that border controls have been imposed due to health grounds in the EU.  Serbia is currently in accession talks with the EU. The Swiss government has ruled out closing its borders for the time being, including with ItalyExternal link, where over 12,000 cases have been registered and the entire country is in quarantine conditions. Switzerland this week shuttered nine border crossings with Italy and directing traffic to main routes while still letting workers get to their jobs. * This article was updated on March 12 following a statement External linkby the Serbian embassy in Bern.

2020-03-12;As virus spreads, Ticino curbs social life;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/italian-border_ticino-s-coronavirus-state-of-emergency-continues/45611262;The southern Swiss canton of Ticino, bordering Italy, is shuttering cinemas, ski resorts, gyms, nightclubs and non-compulsory schools. Other cantons may follow with similar measures, announced the federal health office on Thursday. The hardest-hit Swiss canton is attempting to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was here that first infections were detected, and the virus appears to have since started to spread locally.  By declaring a state of necessity , the cantonal authorities are taking a series of unusual emergency measuresExternal link that discourage but do not ban participation in public life for people at particular risk.  On Wednesday, the same day that the Geneva-based World Health Organization labelled coronavirus as a pandemic, the Ticino cantonal authorities said its emergency measures would stay in place until March 29. The shut-down does not affect higher education or vocational training establishments. Among the 12 measures introduced in Ticino is one that discourages people over 65 from looking after children or taking public transport.

The move is designed to better control and monitor the influx of workers from its southern neighbour. However, the government has resisted closing down the border altogether. Prior to the outbreak, around 68,000 people commuted for work from Italy each day. A delegation from Ticino met with federal government ministers and said that other measures would be considered to control the spread of the virus. But officials did not specify which measures are under consideration. SWISS International Air Lines has now suspended all flights to Italy, along with other European destinations such as Stuttgart, Nuremburg and Bordeaux. The suspension will continue until early April. Swiss Federal Railways has also restricted its schedule to Venice and Milan, it announced on Wednesday. Italy remains in a lockdown, including travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings, as the death toll rises.

2020-03-12;Can countries keep up with the spread of Covid-19?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus---------_can-countries-keep-up-with-the-spread-of-covid-19-/45610762;"The new coronavirus epidemic has starkly exposed the weaknesses of countries' health systems. Yet great progress has been made combating epidemics worldwide since the SARS outbreak in 2003, says Gilles Poumerol, a Geneva-based international public health expert.  With each new pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) finds itself in the hot seat, accused of either doing too much or too little. It is caught between the demands of its member states, especially its biggest donors, and its role as coordinator of global health policies. But step by step, WHO is improving global responses to new epidemics, explains Poumerol.  swissinfo.ch: The world is facing a major challenge with the rapid spread of this new coronavirus from China. How are new viruses changing the situation? Gilles Poumerol: Over 60% of emerging viral infections in humans come from animals. The “One Health InitiativeExternal link” launched at the beginning of the 2000s underlines that all living beings live together and that our health is highly interdependent.  Yet these transmissions of viruses from animals to humans are taking on major proportions. The phenomenon is linked to the way societies evolve and to the increase in the world population, which slowly eats away at the territory of wild ecological systems. Improved hygiene and the development of antibiotics have lowered the threat of infections such as cholera. But we still face new viruses originating from animals for which we have no medicines.  swissinfo.ch: So, like the rest of the living world, viruses are evolving and adapting to changes in their natural environment?  G.P.: Exactly. In order to survive, viruses need the cells of living organisms which they exploit. In some cases, a balance is struck between the virus and the living organism, and they exist in harmony. This is the case with bats, which carry numerous viruses but don’t get sick or die from them; however, they can pass on the viruses to humans. swissinfo.ch: Medicine and hygiene have made great progress over the past century. What does the current epidemic tell us about such developments?  G.P.: If we are able to live to the age of 80, it is thanks to progress in hygiene, vaccines and antibiotics. This helps control many infections.  The viruses behind recent epidemics may have existed before. But today we are able to detect them much quicker and to better monitor them. This is also one of the reasons why we feel we are being regularly attacked by new viruses. We are also reaching certain limits in treatments, even though the production of new vaccines is progressing. Covid-19 has revealed another problem. Many countries have not yet properly understood the dangers of these epidemics. They have not equipped themselves with early detection and rapid response systems to contain the emergence of these new infections. swissinfo.ch: How has WHO responded to recent epidemics?  G.P.: In recent years, we have done a lot of work at WHO to put in place International Health RegulationsExternal link to alert countries to the need to have appropriate response capacities. New health regulations were developed in 2015 in response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which had a relatively big economic impact, despite its rapid containment. Certain countries worked together to finalise an international agreement on how to work together during such crises, such as sharing information, helping each other and the correct way of responding, for example. Slowly progress is being made. With this new coronavirus and its economic impact, every country should understand the importance of having detection and warning systems to deal with it. If we had such detection and warning systems in every country, it would allow us to act as quickly as possible to prevent a spread of viruses like Covid-19. It is a bit like fighting fires. There are fire stations that are not used very often. But they are ready to respond to a fire which stops it from spreading. swissinfo.ch: Do such shortfalls only affect poor countries?  G.P.: No. There are countries that are wealthy enough, but which have not invested sufficiently in preparations and the ability to respond quickly to new epidemics. And when a virus emerges in these countries, it is almost impossible to prevent it spreading to the rest of the world. The epidemic can be slowed down, but not stopped. swissinfo.ch: How long will this epidemic last?  G.P.: There are still many unknowns. Is it contagious before signs of the disease appear? It appears so. How many days before? Is the virus contagious if you don’t develop symptoms? The mortality rate is estimated at around 2%. But maybe this rate will be reviewed when we have all the data.  As to China, the virus peaked two months after it began spreading in late December. And since the end of February, it has been declining. This follows the particularly drastic measures the authorities implemented, including the quarantining of 50 million people. It is still too early to know to what extent these measures have been decisive and whether in the other countries affected, we will see the same two-month rise, followed by a stabilization and a descent. If this is the case, in Europe and the northern hemisphere, the epidemic is likely to a become a minimal risk from around May or June, as many viruses struggle to survive when the temperatures rise.  The epidemic will probably continue in the southern hemisphere during the winter season, and then return to the northern hemisphere next winter. But these are just hypotheses. swissinfo.ch: Could Covid-19 become endemic?  G.P.: This is a possibility. The hope is that we can find a vaccine that can protect a large part of the population at risk within the next six to 12 months.

2020-03-11;How will we judge multinationals when the epidemic is over?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eye-on-the-multinationals-briefing_how-will-we-judge-multinationals-when-the-epidemic-is-over-/45610920;What has made multinational companies in Switzerland so successful is exactly what is making them particularly vulnerable in a global epidemic. In the Financial Times last week, Ian Goldin, author of the Butterfly DefectExternal link, wrote that “The super-spreaders of the goods of globalisation are also super-spreaders of the bads.” This pretty much sums up Switzerland, which has one of the highest per capita infection rates of the novel coronavirus. It is also one of the top ten countries exposed to Chinese supply disruptions as a result of the outbreak, having lost out on some $1 billion in exports in February. Sizing up the full economic fallout could take a while, but the people hardest hit will not be the CEOs. They are those who sew together the surgical masksExternal link, clean hospital beds, and stock supermarket shelves. It is those who don’t have the luxury to work from home and who don’t have a steady salary or savings to lean on when companies cut back. While Switzerland can afford to cushion the blow for workers inside the country, how multinational companies respond to the crisis beyond desk jobs at their headquarters in Baar or Basel will determine how well they rebound and are ultimately judged by the public when this is all over. This also pertains to the pharmaceutical industry, which accounts for a third of Swiss exports, and has so far been fairly quiet on R&D plans on Covid-19. Many big companies have abandoned emerging infectious diseases and instead opted for more lucrative areas like oncology and rare diseases. Was this the right move? How do you think global companies should be responding to the Covid-19 outbreak? How has it impacted your work? Drop me a line. jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch Yes, there is other news. The Swiss parliament batted around a counter proposalExternal link to the Responsible Business Initiative this week, ultimately coming up empty handed. The ball goes back in the Senate’s court, dragging out more than two years of debate. In an interview in the NZZ, Swiss law professor and OECD lead for responsible business conduct Christine Kaufmann said current Swiss law needs an update and legal liability should be a partExternal link of it but that the popular initiative goes too far. She argued that a company will never be able to identify all violations, from the smallest sub-suppliers in the entire supply chain. Parliament also stoked the fire of campaigners of the initiative by voting in favour of letting companies deduct fines imposed abroad from their Swiss tax bill. Although it added some due diligence language, the compromise isn’t exactly the disincentive to exploit in far away lands that some left-wing parties were hoping for. One parliamentarian went so far as to say that this amounts to “tax subsidies” for companies that act illegally. Nespresso and its celebrity brand ambassador George Clooney were in the spotlight (and not the Hollywood red carpet kind) last week after children were found working on coffee farms in Guatemala, that allegedly supply to Nestlé-owned coffee giant Nespresso. The company stopped all purchases from the region while it investigates. Clooney’s response? “Surprised and saddened” by the news. What else? Chocolate companies are feeling unsettled on many fronts. Lindt & Spruengli says that we may be paying more for their chocolate bars very soon to cover the cocoa price premium being demanded by Ivory Coast and Ghana. The demand is an attempt to raise the pay for farmers that are trying to cope with a crop that has been hard hitExternal link by weatherExternal link and pests. Whether it will achieve its intended aims is still unclear. In the meantime, the Ghanaian President paid a visit to the capital Bern, the third visit by a head of state from sub-Saharan Africa. Good chances chocolate was on the menu. Thanks for reading. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Around 68,000 people cross the Swiss-Italian border every day for work. Countless more travel for pleasure. The Swiss canton’s economy relies heavily on its Italian hinterland for labour and trade. Yet, there is considerable confusion on the impact on Switzerland of the drastic measures taken in Italy. Many are asking why the border has not been closed. Some 16 million people in Italy woke up on Sunday morning to the news that much of Italy’s north was on virtual lockdown - by Tuesday morning the Italian government had extended the measures across the country, a move that affects around 60 million people. Officials ordered everyone across the country not to move around other than for work and emergencies, banned all public gatherings and suspended sporting events. This is an attempt to contain the outbreak of coronavirus that has led to more than 10,000 known infections in the country and resulted in over 600 known deaths by Wednesday. This is the highest in the world outside China. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. On Wednesday, Swiss International Airlines suspended all flights to and from Italian destinations until April, The Swiss railway operator also reduced long-distance rail links with Italy. The first known coronavirus infections in Switzerland occurred in Italian-speaking Ticino, which borders Italy, but the virus has since started to spread independently in the country. Ticino remains the most strongly affected canton. On Tuesday, the canton announcedExternal link its first death from the coronavirus, an 80-year-old woman, an old people’s home resident. This is the third such death in Switzerland. Many have been urging the Swiss authorities to seal the Swiss border, including medical professionals. “The health structures in Lombardy are having great difficulty following these patients. We have to do everything to avoid the spread of the virus,” Ticino physician and University of Bern professor Andreas Cerny told Swiss public television, RTS, on Wednesday. Right-wing protest movement Lega dei Ticinesi has also called for the closure of the Swiss border for people entering from Italy. However, the economic risks are also considerable. Cross-border commuters from Italy account for more than a quarter of the total workforce in Ticino. Almost two-thirds of these workers are active in the service sector.  Closing the border therefore risks paralysing a large part of the Ticino economy, jeopardising many basic services for the population. Among the sectors most affected would be the hospital sector: about half of the nursing staff are foreign and a fifth are cross-border workers. The Italian restrictions are expected to stay in force at least until April 3. The Italian authorities indicated that nobody would be allowed to move in or out of these areas, or within them, unless they had proven, work-related reasons for doing so, emergencies or health issues.  The Swiss government said it required Italians working in Switzerland to provide proof of work as they enter the country. The federal customs administration said it was using spot checks and risk-based border controls.  The Ticino authorities have also intensified checks at the border and surrounding areas, German-speaking Swiss public television SRF reported on Tuesday. Several thousand cars with Italian number plates have been checked since Monday morning, officials said. People without the right work permit have been sent back to Italy (this numbered 300 on Monday). The measures are resulting in longer lines at border crossings, the report said. But Italians will not be prevented from working in Switzerland, a decision that is important for Ticino’s economy. This should ensure the continued functioning of the Ticino health system, the Swiss government said in an updated statement on MondayExternal link. Nearly 4,000 Italians work in the canton's health care system. It is unclear how Italian students who are enrolled at universities in Ticino or elsewhere in Switzerland are affected. The University of Italian Switzerland has asked its students from those areas in Italy to refrain from visiting the university’s campuses in Lugano and Mendrisio. On Tuesday, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) announcedExternal link it had decided to suspend lectures held as part of the Bachelor and Master degree courses until March 22. Bern has told Swiss residents to avoid visiting affected areas, but the border remains open for goods and international trains have been operating largely on schedule. There is no ban in place. Other countries have issued travel advisories telling their citizens to not travel to affected areas. The Swiss government has said that it has no plans to fully close the border to Italy, as was reiteratedExternal link by interior minister Alain Berset, who holds the health portfolio, on Monday evening on Italian-speaking public broadcaster RSI.  The government repeated its stance on Tuesday, its spokesman issuing a denial on twitterExternal link of a media report suggesting that the border would close. Economic considerations weigh heavily on the decision given the importance of workers in Italy to the local economy in Ticino. Italians occupy every fourth job in the canton. A public survey published by the SonntagsBlick newspaper over the weekend suggested that one in four Swiss wanted the border with Italy to be closed because of the coronavirus epidemic. Swiss neighbour Austria has barred travelers from crossing the border without a medical certificate. There are currently no plans to call for the return of Swiss citizens who are living or staying in Italy, Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Georg Farago told SRF on Tuesday. Swiss abroad and tourists in the country should follow local authorities' instructions, Farago said. The Ticino government said late Monday evening that it was banning hospital and old peoples’ homes visits from Tuesday to protect the health of the most vulnerable and hospital resources.

2020-03-11;Online shopping breaches CHF10 billion mark;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/cyber-sales_online-shopping-breaches-chf10-billion-mark/45610414;Swiss shoppers spent more than CHF10 billion ($11 billion) online last year, an increase of 8.4% from 2018, according to a study of retail habits. Electronics and fashion goods dominated orders. Food accounted for just 2.8% of the total goods consumed (up from 1.8% in 2018), but the report’s authors expect orders to increase this year with people reluctant to go to supermarkets in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Online shoppers predominantly favoured Swiss products, spending CHF8.3 billion in domestic online stores compared to CHF2 billion going to foreign competition. At the end of 2018, US online giant Amazon said it would reduce the number of items available in Switzerland due to changes in Swiss value-added tax law. By contract, Switzerland’s largest online store Digitec Galaxus recorded sales of more than CHF1 billion for the first time last year. According to the research, the whole Swiss retail trade turned over CHF91.6 billion in sales last year. Online orders made up 9.1% of this total. The study was conducted by the Swiss Mail Order Association together with the GfK research institute and Swiss Post. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-10;No ‘ghost flights’ to Zurich airport, authorities say;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/landing-slots_no--ghost-flights--to-zurich-airport--authorities-say/45608734;With passenger numbers down due to Covid-19, some airlines want authorities to loosen rules maintaining that airport landing slots are lost unless fully used. “Use it or lose it”: regulations state that when an airline is allocated a landing slot, it must use it at least 80% of the time planned, or else risk being stripped of it the following year. As the coronavirus outbreak disrupts travel plans globally and airlines cancel or pare back flights, this is reportedly leading to drastic measures and calls to loosen the rules. Speaking on Swiss public radio RTSExternal link on Monday, the Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Alexandre de Juniac, said that his group had asked regulators to waive the rules until October, given the current situation. He was responding to reports – including from The TimesExternal link – that some planes had been flying with few or no passengers at all in order not to lose out on the valuable slots. According to The Times, British Transport Minister Grant Shapps also wrote to the airport slot coordinator in the UK, asking it to relax the existing regulations due to concerns about the environmental impact of running empty flights. So far, de Juniac said on Monday, the rules remain in place – apart from exceptions for Hong Kong and China – but he expects that “a favourable decision will be taken”. He also said, regarding airlines operating empty planes, that “it’s possible this is happening, but it’s quite limited”. A spokesperson from Swiss International Airlines told swissinfo.ch on Tuesday that they have not been operating empty or near-empty flights in a bid to maintain landing slots. However, the spokesman said, “we would welcome a targeted suspension of the present slot regulations that would release airlines from having to operate empty flights just to retain their landing and takeoff rights, which would make no sense at all in economic or ecological terms”. Authorities at Zurich airport, meanwhile, also told swissinfo.ch that they had not heard of such “ghost flights” landing or taking off from their tarmac. As for the rules around slots, although the airport “understands” the tricky situation airlines find themselves in due to the 80/20 usage rule, it also can’t change the situation – these rules are set by other regulators, including slot coordination SwitzerlandExternal link. At the European level, meanwhile, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the EU indeed planned to introduce temporary legislation to solve the landing slot problem without causing undue environmental damage.

2020-03-10;Roche tells all Spanish staff to work remotely;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_roche-tells-all-spanish-staff-to-work-remotely/45608534;Swiss pharma giant Roche said on Tuesday it would send all of its 1,200 Spanish employees home starting from Wednesday to work remotely amid the coronavirus outbreak.  “The company will maintain its normal activity and will guarantee, as until now, the supply of medicines to hospitals,” Roche said in a statement. The company made the decision after Spanish authorities ordered to shut down all schools in Madrid on Monday. Twenty-eight people have died in Spain from the coronavirus, with the number of cases jumping on Monday to 1,204, one of the highest in Europe. In Switzerland, where the number of infections crossed the 500 mark on Tuesday, many big firms have encouraged staff to work from home, such as UBS, Credit Suisse, Swisscom and Google. The tech giant, for example, recommends that its 4,000 employees in Switzerland work from home “if their role allows”. However, the Google Zurich office remains open and the situation is continually being reviewed, it says. On February 28, the company confirmed that a Zurich employee had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Roche spokesperson Karsten Kleine said the firm was taking a similar approach in Switzerland, encouraging staff to avoid using public transport during rush hours and making use of flexible working hours.  We also reduced the number of  larger on-site team meetings, encourage employees to do virtual meetings and enable home office in coordination with the needs of the company, the respective function and the supervisor, he said. Elsewhere, UBS and Nestle have imposed travel bans on employees, while fragrance maker Givaudan on Wednesday opted to temporarily close a site near Zurich because an employee contracted the disease.  The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected about 114,300 people and killed more than 4,000 worldwide, the vast majority in China.

2020-03-10;Diplomacy goes virtual as the coronavirus goes viral;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/opinion_diplomacy-goes-virtual-as-the-coronavirus-goes-viral/45606142;The spread of the new coronavirus is testing our globalised world, writes Jovan Kurbalija, executive director of DiploFoundation External linkand head of the Geneva Internet PlatformExternal link.  Countries are looking at one another with suspicion, once bustling public spaces seem emptier, and many people and organisations are avoiding travel. The world of diplomacy is particularly affected by these developments, as meetings, conferences, and other major events are cancelled. However, diplomacy cannot stop: international cooperation is essential in times of crisis. Driven by necessity, diplomacy is adapting. For the first time, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will host their Spring Meetings onlineExternal link. The United Nations, European Union and other organisations are moving from conference rooms to online spaces, triggering a profound change in the way diplomacy is conducted. While the public health crisis is accelerating this shift, diplomacy supported by electronic tools (‘e-diplomacy’) is not new. Since 2006, the Internet Governance ForumExternal link - the world’s preeminent Internet policy forum - has combined face-to-face and online participation. Back in 2010, the eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull disrupted air travel worldwide and triggered a massive increase in the use of tele-conferencing tools.  More recently, climate change activist Greta Thunberg put a spotlight on business travel by sailing across the Atlantic to New York, and then by taking the train to the climate conference (COP25) in Madrid. The world took note. On the last day of the climate conference, the Swiss government pledged to reduce official air travel by 30% by 2030. The accelerated transition towards online meetings and diplomacy faces three major challenges. The first relates to the technology itself. There have been innumerable breakthroughs in communications technology, yet it still often fails us. Despite all the latest technological developments, online platforms are not yet stable enough nor intuitive enough for seamless meetings.  The online experience is usually characterised by repetitive exchanges of ‘Can you hear me?’ or reminders to (un)mute the microphone. These problems may seem trivial, but they can hamper the momentum of a meeting. This has discouraged both individuals and organisations from relying on online conferencing. There is a clear need for smarter platforms that account for human imperfections and create better user experiences. Furthermore, even to this date, basic access to the Internet remains a serious challenge in many developing countries, which are already marginalised in traditional diplomacy. Reliable access must be ensured in these places in order to avoid digital and diplomatic divides reinforcing each other. The fundamental dynamics of human interaction and attention are the second area of concern. Online meetings bring forth new social dynamics compared to traditional meetings. The rich, human context that shapes a face-to-face meeting is often absent in a virtual setting. Body language and overall ‘personal chemistry’ are minimised or lost entirely. Establishing a presence in meetings, or simply keeping the attention of participants, can be incredibly difficult. When more interesting and engaging content is readily accessible, running an effective meeting is almost impossible. As diplomacy and other fields steer towards the online space, it is clear that we need engaging meeting platforms and techniques beyond the existing ‘talking heads’ format.   Finally we have an issue of particular importance in diplomacy: protocol. Online meetings challenge centuries-old rules of protocol shaped by hierarchy and fixed rituals. Online exchanges have proven to be more informal and less ‘protocol friendly’. While the loss of some aspects of diplomatic tradition would not be regretted, some rules of engagement must remain. Protocol and rituals protect diplomats’ unique role as representatives of their countries, and are essential in allowing them to engage with their counterparts despite divergent and conflicting national positions and interests.  While these challenges will continue to make the art of diplomacy difficult, there is no turning back. We need to adjust and adopt the best of both worlds: a new, ‘hybrid diplomacy’ that combines face-to-face and online meetings. Highly delicate political negotiations such as the recent peace deal between the US and the Taliban demonstrate the continued necessity of gathering real people in actual rooms. But many other more technical and routine meetings can and should shift online.  Hybrid diplomacy will be concentrated around traditional face-to-face meetings, organised online participation, and ad-hoc online meetings.  Hopefully, coronavirus will pass soon. However, in its wake, we must nurture the new ideas and approaches we gain from this crisis, while effectively fusing them with our traditional practices. The way that diplomacy - and our online meeting spaces - adapts will be critical in addressing other crucial issues for humanity, from fighting climate change to ensuring peace and dealing with other global issues for years to come.

2020-03-10;Coronavirus hits Swiss train passenger numbers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/federal-railways_coronavirus-hits-swiss-train-passenger-numbers/45607714;The number of people taking trains in Switzerland has fallen since the outbreak of the coronavirus, resulting in a huge financial hit, Swiss Federal Railways reported on Tuesday. The number of passengers across Switzerland has fallen by 10-20%, while the number of people travelling to Italy has dropped by 90% and those going to France has fallen by 60% compared to before the virus broke out, it said. The Federal Railways is therefore losing CHF500,000 a day, it said. Worldwide, over 114,300 cases of coronavirus infection have been recorded in 111 countries and territories, causing the death of 4,026 people, according to a Reuters tally. Switzerland, meanwhile, recorded a third death on Tuesday due to Covid-19, an 80-year-old woman in Ticino. The number of infections crossed the 500 mark on Tuesday. The coronavirus news came as the state-owned firm announced record figures for 2019. Last year the Federal Railways carried a total of 1.3 million passengers a day – 6% more than in 2018. It sold 124 million tickets – 15% more than in 2018 – and for the first time over half of all tickets were bought online. A total of 8.8 million reduced-price “supersaver” tickets were sold. The number of people buying annual or half-price season passes also rose. Around 3.2 million passengers have one of these passes, or around 50% of the population. The Federal Railways said fewer trains arrived on time (89.5%) last year, but overall customer satisfaction rose for both passenger journeys and freight. Overall the company recorded a net profit of CHF463 million in 2019 (-18% compared to 2018). This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-10;Swiss stock market joins global rout;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-impact-_another-day-of-heavy-losses-for-the-swiss-stock-market/45605942;The Swiss stock market suffered extremely heavy losses on Monday due to a combination of coronavirus fears and falling oil prices.    Stock markets around the world plunged on Monday and oil prices tumbled by as much as a third after Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia, sending investors already scared by the coronavirus outbreak fleeing for the safety of bonds and the Japanese yen. At the end of Monday, the Swiss Market Index (SMI) had fallen by 5.55% to 9,196.6 points compared to the previous day of trading.  Updated stock market ticker:  “The last ten trading sessions rank among the most tumultuous in history,” UBS analysts said in a market commentary.  “The fear of the coronavirus, which is also paralysing the economy in Europe and the USA, is now also affecting companies,” said the St. Gallen Cantonal Bank in a separate statement. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) said Monday had been the biggest fall on the SMI since 1988 – bigger even than the 9/11 crash.  Elsewhere, major European stock markets dived more than 7%, Japanese indexes fell by over 5% and US markets sank over 7% after Saudi Arabia launched an oil price war with Russia. Saudi Arabia's grab for market share was reminiscent of a drive in 2014 that sent prices down by about two-thirds, while the renewed plunge on Wall Street came exactly 11 years after US stocks touched bottom during the financial crisis. Brent and US crude futures slid $14 a barrel to as low as $31.02 and $27.34 in volatile trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,280.4 points, or 4.95%, to 24,584.38. The S&P 500 lost 143.44 points, or 4.83%, to 2,828.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 372.11 points, or 4.34%, to 8,203.51.  Equity markets in Frankfurt and Paris tumbled about 8.5% and London tanked 12%. Italy's main index slumped almost 15% after the government over the weekend ordered a lockdown of large parts of the north of the country, including the financial capital, Milan. The spread of the global coronavirus epidemic is also weighing heavily on investor sentiment. Worldwide, over 114,300 cases of infection have been recorded in 111  countries and territories, causing the death of 4,026 people, according to a Reuters tally.  Switzerland, meanwhile, recorded a second death on Sunday due to Covid-19, a 76-year-old man in poor health.

Martin Nydegger of Switzerland Tourism said on Monday that he expects the virus to account for some 2.1 million fewer overnight stays in Swiss hotels this year compared with 2019, amounting to financial losses of CHF532 million ($574 million). The expected losses, which mirror the dour outlook for many businesses across the world, come after a record tourism year in 2019, which saw just under 40 million overnight stays. “Not everyone will survive this,” Nydegger told the AWP news agency. “Unfortunately, some establishments will be forced to close”. With operating margins are already so low in the sector, he said, even a resurgence of fortunes in good times would not be enough to cover the losses from this crisis. His comments also came on the same day that the Federal Statistical Office released tourism figures for the month of January, which was paradoxically a rather bumper month; hotel stays by both Swiss and international tourists increased markedly, by 7% and 5.7% respectively. The first coronavirus case was announced in Switzerland on February 24. The number of cases has since risen to over 300. Although no official travel bans have been implemented, travelling to areas heavily impacted by Covid-19 is discouraged. Swiss International Airlines have also announced the cancellation or slimming of services to destinations, including China. On Saturday, the director of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) ruled out any short-term stimulus programme for businesses hit hard by falling demand due to the disease.

The SDC mission was closed on Monday along with those of France and Germany, and staff are being repatriated, the Reuters agency reported. Confirming the closure of the office, foreign ministry spokesman Pierre-Alain Eltschinger told swissinfo.ch that the decision was due to North Korea’s recent closing of its borders in an effort to stop the spread of Covid-19. This “considerably impacts” the work of the humanitarian office, he said, and so the decision was taken to repatriate the Swiss members of staff and their companions – four people in total. North Korea has not yet confirmed any cases of coronavirus, but it has ordered foreigners from any country that has reported a case spend 30 days in quarantine. The isolated state is sandwiched between China, where the virus emerged late last year and has infected more than 80,000 people, and South Korea, where the virus has spread rapidly over the past few weeks to infect nearly 7,500 people.

In addition, 86% felt that the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) had provided sufficient information about the virus.  The survey, conducted from March 3-6 among 1,074 people across the country, also found that two-thirds felt little or no threat from the virus, 24% classified the risk of Covid-19 as medium, 8% as high. The values had hardly changed compared with the previous week.  Every fourth person was in favour of closing the borders with Italy, which is one of the countries hit hardest by the virus, along with China, South Korea and Iran.  On Sunday Italy ordered a virtual lockdown across a swathe of its wealthy north in a drastic attempt to try to contain a rapidly growing Covid-19 outbreak (see box).  The Swiss government and European health ministers have so far spoken out against closing the borders because of the far-reaching consequences.  Prevention measures  According to the SonntagsBlick survey, the Swiss population largely follows the prevention measures recommended by the government. Frequent hand washing was part of these measures for 93% of those surveyed, 76% avoided shaking hands and more than half were refraining from travelling abroad.  On the other hand, respondents didn’t think much of face masks: not even one in ten considered wearing one.  In Switzerland there are currently 281 diagnosed cases of Covid-19, the FOPH said on Sunday.

2020-03-06;Swiss prioritise old and sick in battle against coronavirus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/update-_swiss-prioritise-old-and-sick-in-battle-against-coronavirus-/45601378; The Swiss government has shifted its focus in the fight against the coronavirus to protecting those most vulnerable. The army will also be available to give cantons support.  The move comes one day after the first death from the virus was announced, that of a 74-year-old woman in canton Vaud who suffered from additional health problems.  + First coronavirus death recorded in Switzerland The focus is on protecting the health of particularly vulnerable people, the government said in a statement on FridayExternal link, released after a government meeting. The aim is to prevent serious illnesses and deaths as well as avoiding overloading health facilities.   Those considered vulnerable as defined as over 65 and those suffering from medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or who have weakened immune systems.  Until now, the main goal of the Swiss effort was to identify people as early as possible, track the path of transmission and stop further transmission. The number of cases rose again on Friday, with canton Thurgau also reporting its first case. The Federal Office of Public Health said diagnosed cases had reached 210 (cantons use different criteria which accounts for the discrepancies in number of cases reported by them). “We are at the start of an infection wave,” the health minister Alain Berset told reporters at a press conference on Friday.   New recommendations have been issued for the population and the workforceExternal link that include avoiding visits to old people’s homes and hospitals where possible and avoiding peak travel times.  Both Berset and Daniel Koch, the head of infectious diseases at the Federal Office of Public Health, said it was up to the population to show solidarity: people with mild symptoms should not go to hospital emergency departments over the weekend.  On Monday children should go to school as normal – some cantons are starting term again after the half-term holidays – there will be no closures, Koch said. Closures mean children being looked after by grandparents and this is “not the situation we want” he said.  The government will allow the army to support cantons over three weeks in their fight against the spread of the virus, Berset announced. This follows a request from canton Ticino bordering Italy, which had the first coronavirus case. Here army members will help out in hospitals. Up to 800 army staff could be called upon, Berset said in response to a question.  Also under consideration are the economic effects of the virus, Berset said.  The government also freed up CHF9 million ($9.6 million) for research: CHF5 million for the Swiss National Science Foundation and CHF4 million for the World Health Organization, Berset announced.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-03-06;With no prospects for profits, big pharma neglects new infectious diseases;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_with-no-prospects-for-profits--big-pharma-turns-back-on-new-infectious-diseases/45598436;More companies, including some big Swiss drugmakers, are shifting resources away from emerging infectious diseases into more lucrative areas like cancer treatment. Their business decisions risk leaving gaping holes in the fight against epidemics such as the one caused by the novel coronavirus. Despite Switzerland’s position as a pharmaceutical and biotech hubExternal link, companies based here have so far abstained from high-profile commitments related to the global coronavirus outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) listsExternal link of Covid-19 vaccine and treatment candidates contain no Swiss company. And none of the Switzerland-based drugmakers have announced major plans to boost R&D into the virus that has so far infected around 100,000 people in some 80 countries. The wider lack of interest doesn’t come as a surprise to Bernard Pécoul, executive director of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DnDi), a non-profit organisation dedicated to finding treatments for diseases that are not a priority to the industry. “A large number of big pharma companies have abandoned the field of infectious disease. It’s a big concern because we don't think that this is the end of infectious disease as we see with the latest outbreak,” Pécoul told swissinfo.ch in Geneva, where his organisation is based. Since its founding in 2003, DnDi has been on the front lines of efforts to attract investment in populations and diseases that are often ignored. By seeking to re-wire the market-based R&DExternal link model, the group has been able to develop eight new treatments for diseases like sleeping sickness, which threatens millions of people, largely in sub-Saharan Africa. Their efforts are still miniscule compared to the billions pharmaceutical companies pour into cancer research and rare, deadly diseases like spinal muscular atrophy in hopes of big gene breakthroughs. At the same time, investments in emerging infectious diseases – those outside HIV, malaria and tuberculosis – have dwindled. + Swiss foundation launches ‘emergency call’ for coronavirus research The latest Access to Medicines IndexExternal link found that nearly half of R&D projects by the 20 biggest pharmaceutical companies target cancer while there were no projects on coronaviruses (MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov) at the time the report was published. Novartis sold its vaccine divisionExternal link to British pharma company GSK in 2014 after operating at a loss for years. The company no longer has critical mass of expertise in virology, and no laboratories are working on antivirals or diagnostics. Consolidation in the vaccine business has left four big players controlling some 80% of the nearly $45 billion (CHF43 billion) market. “Companies concentrate on the market that is attractive in terms of profit. Oncology is a market that has been very profitable. Now even orphan diseases [rare disease classification by the US government] are marketed as profitable because they could offer a price that is very high.” says Pécoul.   Ellen ‘t Hoen, director of Medicines Law and PolicyExternal link, argues that “pharmaceutical companies don’t necessarily set priorities according to what global health priorities are.” The trained lawyer who worked for Doctors without Borders and the WHO says that shareholders are used to big rewards and their priorities don’t often converge with public health priorities. But some companies argue this explanation is too black and white, pointing out that cancerExternal link is still the second-leading cause of death globally and chronic diseases like diabetesExternal link are on the rise.  In an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in January, Harald Nusser, who leads Novartis Social Business, told swissinfo.ch that the company must consider where its pipeline and experience can make the most meaningful contribution. It is heavily investedExternal link in treatments for tropical diseases such as malaria, leprosy and leishmaniasis. “These may at times not be the biggest public health threats or need at this very moment, but people are still dying of them,” says Nusser. Epidemics pose a unique challenge to pharma executives. There is a lot of activity when an outbreak happens but when it tapers off, so does the investment. This means that “promising medical technologies may fall by the wayside because there is no one ready to pick up the bill,” says ‘t Hoen. This was echoed by Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan in an interview on CNBCExternal link earlier this year, who said there is a lot of interest and activity but then a lot isn’t happening and people lose interest and the investment flows out. So, the question is how do you keep the investment in place in the troughs of interest in pandemics, and these kind of outbreaks?” GSK’s experience in Ebola is one often-cited cautionary taleExternal link. After investing for years in three vaccines, progress stalled in the final stage of clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases. With no real prospect of a financial return, the company eventually gave up and handed the candidates over to a non-profit institute in the US last year. This was despite an Ebola outbreak at the time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. + A Swiss lab made the first synthetic clone of Covid-19 Companies suffered a similar fate during SARS, said Thomas Cueni, who heads the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, on Swiss public television RTS. External link “Some 17 years ago, there were companies which started to develop vaccines. But when it was time for clinical tests, there were no more patients, because the virus was gone.” These experiences have likely made companiesExternal link more cautious about diving head-first into the search for novel coronavirus vaccinations or Covid-19 therapies. Many companiesExternal link have been donating supplies and offering advice to local and global health authorities. Novartis, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi have indicated that they are reviewing existing products to see if they can be repurposed for the coronavirus. Roche’s arthritis drug Actemra has been added to the diagnosis and treatment plan for Covid-19 issued by the China National Health Commission on March 3 as a possible therapy for seriously ill patients. The company is also working with a German company that uses Roche’s LightCycler® 480 System to speed up the diagnosis of coronavirus infections. A company spokesperson told swissinfo.ch that it is delivering as many tests as possible within the limits of supply. While these efforts are significant, vaccine development would involve much larger financial commitments on very short notice with very little prospects of a financial return. That urgency also brings risks, including legal liability for the companies. Many investors are placing betsExternal link on smaller companies that are more willing to take on the risks. When little-known company Vaxart announced it was searching for a possible Covid-19 vaccine, its stock jumped 106.1%. Shares also rose for other biotechs such as Novovax and Inovio after they announced plans for testing and trials. The WHO predicts a coronavirus vaccine would take 18 months to make, which is less than the typical vaccine development process. Looking back on a 35-year-long career in global health, ‘t Hoen fears that we still haven’t learned the lessons from the past. “The coronavirus seems poised to join a lengthy list of health problems the industry turns its back on unless additional incentives are made available,” she wrote in a recent commentary in BarronsExternal link. Ultimately some kind of public-private partnership is going to save the day, says ‘t Hoen. She just hopes that affordability is addressed up front and manufacturers don’t receive exclusive rights. This was already a source of tension in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations,External link which is seen as promising effort to drive investment into vaccine R&D for epidemics. The group has struggled to get pharmaceutical firmsExternal link to agree to be partners without insisting on substantial profits or proprietary rights to research that CEPI, funded largely by governments and charities like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, helped finance and produce.  Pécoul would hate to see a solution whereby companies simply donate drugs and offer up some money. “We need some commitment that is much stronger than charity.

A 74-year-old woman died early on Thursday, the federal authorities saidExternal link. The woman, who had suffered from a chronic illness and was thus considered at high risk, was hospitalised in Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), in western Switzerland, on Tuesday. The woman probably got infected on a trip to Italy, according to the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA. Although at a press conference on Thursday, Karim Boubaker, the cantonal doctor for Vaud, did not want to give further details out of respect for the deceased's family and doctor confidentiality.  On Wednesday the Federal Office of Public Health said that nearly 100 people had tested positive for coronavirus, with 58 confirmed and more pending. It added that so far it was mostly young people who had contracted the disease in Switzerland, but they were likely to pass it on to older people who are more at risk. The Swiss government has banned events and gatherings of more than 1,000 people and advised people to keep their distance, avoid shaking hands and refrain from the traditional Swiss triple-kiss greeting.

2020-03-04;SWISS cuts 20% of European flights;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-extends-flight-restrictions-for-china--iran-and-italy/45590154;"In the face of the coronavirus outbreak, SWISS International Airlines has further reduced its flight plan.  On Wednesday SWISS announced that it would be pruning its schedule of short- and medium-haul flights from Zurich and Geneva. SWISS is also cutting back on flights to Tokyo, Osaka and Singapore, with two fewer flights to each destination per week. Adjustments to the short- and medium-haul network are valid until March 28; those to the long-haul network until April 24. Already on Monday, SWISS had announced that for the safety of passengers and flight crew, it was extending its suspension of flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 24. This followed the announcement in February that the suspension on flights to Mainland China would be suspended until March 28. This was a decision taken by the parent company, Lufthansa Group, and applies to several airlines including Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. The Lufthansa Group also suspended flights from Munich to Hong Kong between March 6 and April 24. Some connections are also cancelled on the routes from Frankfurt and Munich to Seoul. New restrictions have also been put in place for other destinations that have seen an outbreak of Covid-19 infections in the last couple of weeks. Connections to Tehran have been suspended until April 30, according to Keystone-SDA. The airline group also announced on Friday that, owing to changed demand, it was cutting back on flights to northern Italy, specifically Florence, Milan, Rome and Venice, which includes 28 flights a week. According to the airline websiteExternal link, passengers whose flights were cancelled can re-book free of charge or receive a refund of their ticket. Free re-booking is also available for several destinations in northern Italy. Further restrictions on short and long-haul flights are being considered. The airline also advises any passengers traveling to other destinations to check local requirements as some governments have restricted entry for people who have travelled to China. In some cases, this applies to passengers with a Chinese passport. SWISS spokesperson Karin Müller told Keystone-SDA that she did not want to give figures on how bookings have fallen recently. As a matter of principle, we do not communicate concrete figures about this. According to Müller, more information is expected to be shared during the SWISS annual media conference on March 19.

2020-03-04;Chinese economic disruption hits Swiss supply chains;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-impact_chinese-economic-disruption-hits-swiss-supply-chains/45596454;"China’s sharp contraction in economic activity over the past month due to the coronavirus epidemic is sending shockwaves across the globe. Switzerland is one of the top ten countries exposed to Chinese supply disruptions, a United Nations report reveals.  Over the past month China, which has a central role in global supply chains, has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) – down to 35.7 from 50 in January, its lowest reading since 2004, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.  So far, this shrinkage in Chinese output has cost other countries and their industries around $50 billion (CHF47.8 billion), UNCTAD External linksaid on Wednesday.  At present, the most-affected economies, which rely heavily on Chinese parts and components to manufacture cars, cell phones, medical equipment, and other products, are the European Union (resulting in an estimated $15.6 billion in lost exports in February), the United States (-$5.7 billion), Japan (-$5.1 billion) and the Republic of Korea (-$3.8 billion).  UNCTAD ranked Switzerland tenth, with $1 billion in lost exports in February due to the China supply disruptions; chemicals, precision instruments and machinery are the most exposed sectors, UNCTAD said.   + Swiss industries brace for impact of coronavirus outbreak  The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) recently expressed concern in the medium term about the impact of the coronavirus on capital markets and the interruption of supply chains for Swiss industry and international corporations based in Switzerland. Swiss economics minister Guy Parmelin will host a crisis summit on the coronavirus on Thursday to discuss the impact of the virus with industry and social services agencies.   Global agencies, meanwhile, say that there will be a significant economic impact as the virus spreads. On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the coronavirus, which was first detected in China but has now spread to 60 nations in Europe, the US, Latin America and other parts of Asia, could cause the world economy to shrink this quarter for the first time since the international financial crisis more than a decade ago.  “Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short term the overall impact on the global economy is likely to be significant in terms of negative downturn. For developing countries, the impact of what’s happening in China will be felt very intensely,” UNCTAD Director of International Trade and Commodities Pamela Coke-Hamilton told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday.  The number of reported coronavirus cases worldwide has risen above 94,000, with the death toll exceeding 3,200. Most fatalities have been in China. Meanwhile, the fall in industrial activity has had other effects. Nasa satellite images have shown a dramatic declineExternal link in pollution levels over China, which the US space agency believes is “partly related” to an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus.

2020-03-03;Coronavirus cases are spreading in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_switzerland-confirms-second-coronavirus-case/45582788;"This story is current as of March 3 and is no longer being updated. See here for the latest on the coronavirus situation in Switzerland.  As the first domestic coronavirus infections appear in the country and nearly half of all Swiss cantons have reported cases, federal authorities have stepped up efforts to slow the spread of the virus. There are now more than 50 confirmed current active cases in Switzerland. On Monday, authorities reported the first cases of people infected by Covid-19 inside the country. Since the first confirmed case on February 25, infections had been related to travel to infected regions outside Switzerland.  + Coronavirus: the situation in Switzerland The rising number of cases prompted the government to introduce new guidelines and measures to curb the spread of the disease. On Monday, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)External link urged the public to avoid shaking hands and to dispose of used tissues in sealed waste bins.  Already last week, the office released advice on thorough hand-washing as well as how to sneeze and cough properly. Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose portfolio includes health issues, told the SonntagsZeitungExternal link newspaper it was best to avoid the customary three-kiss social greeting. The Swiss government also took an unprecedented measure last Friday to take over powers from the cantonal authorities to ban large gatherings (over 1,000 people) in order to contain the spread of the virus.  + The government issued new rules to prevent the spread of the virus. What are they? The decision was made shortly before the Geneva-based World Health OrganizationExternal link raised its impact risk alert for the coronavirus worldwide to “very high” – its highest level. The number of reported cases worldwide has risen above 90,000, with the death toll exceeded 3,100, most of them in China.  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that about 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the novel coronavirus can be contained. To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained, he declared. The number of coronavirus cases below includes positive test results reported by the cantons that have yet to be confirmed by the reference lab in Geneva.  Some local governments, including canton Bern and the town of Chur in south-eastern Switzerland, have announced even stricter measures. Bern authorities say they will cancel events with fewer than 1,000 participants if organizers cannot prove that none of the participants were in a region affected by the virus in the past 14 days. Chur is banning all events with more than 50 participants, with some exceptions. The cantons are expected to announce coordinated measures in the coming days.  Authorities are also reportedly discussing possible checks of passengers arriving at Geneva Airport from countries where the risk of infection is deemed high, Swiss public broadcaster RTS said. + Swiss foundation launches ‘emergency call’ for coronavirus research As a result of the ban on public events, a number of major events across Switzerland have been cancelled, including the annual meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which was scheduled to take place in Lausanne in March. This month’s Geneva International Motor ShowExternal link, which usually attracts around 600,000 visitors, along with local carnivals across the country, have also been axed. On Monday, the president of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ambassador Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, announced that all human rights side events at the three-week-long session would be cancelled from March 3. Around 1,000 people are likely to be affected. Human rights meetings in the main conference hall, which takes up to 700, will meanwhile continue until March 20. All public guided tours to the UN headquarters in Geneva have also been cancelled. The same day the organisers of the 18th annual International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in Geneva announced External linkthat they had cancelled the annual event (March 6-15). A meeting of the Council of the Swiss AbroadExternal link scheduled for March 14 in Bern will not take place. Instead the leading members of the council, will take decision in a meeting by skype.   The regular spring session of the Swiss parliament opened on Monday with exceptional measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. The parliamentary building has been closed to guests and visitors; access for journalists has been restricted. Several sports events have also been cancelled including the Swiss football league, which has been put on hold until at least March 23 because of the coronavirus outbreak after the clubs rejected the possibility of playing matches behind closed doors. Some 2,000 suspected cases have been found to be negative. Nose and throat swabs were being taken and sent to laboratories for screening.  The number of testing laboratories in Switzerland has been boosted from one to ten with increased capacities. They can perform 1,000 coronavirus tests a day.  The Office of Public Health also said that a number of people are in quarantine. On Sunday, two college classes in canton Bern were placed in quarantine for 14 days, a first in the country. One of the students at the technical college in the town of Biel/Bienne, a 21-year-old, had tested positive for the virus.   A luxury hotel in the spa resort of Bad Ragaz in eastern Switzerland has placed five employees on a leave of absence as a precautionary measure, after they came into contact with a guest who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Over the weekend, Daniel Koch, the head of communicable diseases at the public health office, told the NZZ am SonntagExternal link newspaper that he was confident that the risks will decrease over time. This is partly because a vaccine is likely to be developed at some point. In the end, the virus “will become a disease like any other that we already know how to handle,” he added. The Swiss border to Italy will remain open, Koch said on Saturday, adding that closing the border to the southern neighbour would not help to stop the spread of the disease.  The border also needed to be open to guarantee sufficient staffing at Swiss medical facilities, Koch said. He also said that schools would remain open.  SWISS international airlines has suspended or restricted travel to several countries including China, Iran and Italy. A representative of the foreign ministry told the media that no additional repatriations of Swiss nationals in affected regions of the world are currently planned.  Earlier this month the foreign affairs ministry had arranged the voluntary repatriations of Swiss citizens from the Chinese province of Hubei, which is widely assumed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. Cancelling major events will have an impact on businesses and sectors concerned, Eric Scheidegger, head of economic policy at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), said. + Swiss industries brace for impact of coronavirus outbreak  But there are also concerns about the impact of the disease on supply chains and capital markets. The BAK economic institute on Tuesday revised its growth forecast downwards for the first six months to 1.3%, compared to 1.5% previously.

It wants the authorities to set up a crisis fund.  Last Friday, the Swiss government made the unprecedented move of taking over powers from cantonal authorities to ban gatherings of over 1,000 people, in order to contain the spread of the virus. The countrywide ban on public events is in place until at least March 15. On Tuesday, the Swiss Association of Concert, Show and Festival Music Organizers (SMPA) declared External linkthat the decision was akin to a “professional ban” and demanded that the government establish a crisis fund to help provide financial compensation for cancelled events. The ban came into force with immediate effect in the midst of the carnival season which draws thousands of revellers to many Swiss towns and cities. It has also affected a long list of events, shows and conferences across the country, including the cancelled international motor show in GenevaExternal link and BaselworldExternal link watch fair.  The association said in a statement that the consequences of the general ban, which affects individuals, organisations, suppliers and service providers, had not been properly considered.  The association, which represents 43 Swiss concert, show and festival organizers, said the limit of 1,000 was “arbitrary”. It criticized Switzerland for being the only country to take such drastic measures. France, for example, has set a 5,000 participant/guest limit. + An in-depth dossier on the coronavirus in SwitzerlandExternal link It demands that events with fewer than 1,000 guests be allowed to go ahead “without disproportionate restrictions”. In addition, the rules must be applied in a uniform manner across all 26 cantons, it said. Some local governments, including canton Bern and the town of Chur in south-eastern Switzerland, have announced even stricter measures. The association fears the long-term consequences if the ban is extended: “The Swiss events industry, like many Swiss artists, fears for its existence.”  The government, however, is not obliged to underwrite financial losses caused by the ban on major events; the principle of force majeure – unforeseeable event - applies.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

Three weeks before the first case was identified on Swiss soil scientists at a high security lab managed to make a synthetic clone of the coronavirus. The researchers are now trying to determine the importance of its individual genes. Their accomplishment is getting worldwide attention: labs and companies are requesting the clone to work on. The high security laboratory is located in Mittelhäusern, a small village in canton Bern. The virologist Volker Thiel has been working with coronaviruses for a long time. His team is now researching what differentiates the new Covid-19 from the SARS virus. Most importantly, they want to find out how to weaken the virus so that it doesn’t cause more harm. Switzerland also contributed to another breakthrough discovery concerning the coronavirus. The cryogenic electron microscopy technique that earned the Swiss scientist Jacques Dubochet a Nobel Prize in 2017 allowed a lab in Texas to identify a key protein of the Covid-19. The American scientists were able to reproduce a 3D image of the protein that allows the virus to enter a cell only two months after the discovery of the new virus.

2020-03-03;Bern scientists claim coronavirus breakthrough;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_bern-scientists-claim-coronavirus-breakthrough/45592602;Researchers at the University of Bern have perfected a technique to produce synthetic clones of the new coronavirus strain much faster. The method should allow researchers to deactivate individual genes of the Covid-19 virus and to study the effects. This should enable scientists to identify the genes needed to replicate the virus and which would be a promising target for drugs, Volker Thiel of the university virology and immunology laboratory told Swiss public television, SRF, on Monday evening. Thiel added that the team were receiving numerous requests for virus clones.  His team had received samples of the first people infected by the new coronavirus in Germany in early February. The samples are currently being analysed at a laboratory in Mittelhäusern, canton Bern, one of the few facilities in the world able to carry out such research.  The work of another Swiss researcher, Nobel Prize winner Jacques Dubochet, is also closely tied to ongoing investigations into the virus, as revealed by the journal ScienceExternal link.  Dubochet’s research developing cryo-electron microscopyExternal link has enabled a team from the University of Texas to quickly identify a key protein in Covid-19, a crucial step in the search for a vaccine. Up to now, “the main method for determining molecular structure has been X-ray diffraction. It takes an incredible amount of time, years,” the Vaudois explained on Monday evening to Swiss public television, RTS. With cryo-electron microscopy, however, “you just need the very pure protein… it goes into the thin layer and that's enough”. According to RTS, this method makes it possible to study biological samples by freezing them. The new coronavirus broke out in Wuhan, China, late last year and has since infected more than 89,000 people, mostly in China. However, it now appears to be spreading much more rapidly outside China than within. The global death toll exceeded 3,000, with the virus spreading to more than 60 countries. Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths. Scientists say much remains unknown about the virus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine could take up to 18 months to develop.

Most of the companies that have filed applications with local authorities are in the tourism, retail and gastro industries; however, those with manufacturing operations in China have also filed requests according to a survey by the Keystone-SDA news agency. In Switzerland, employers can reduce employee working hours if a business temporarily has too little or no work. Under the scheme the employer can receive financial support from cantonal authorities in order to continue to pay workers. Employees receive partial employment benefits for working reduced hours that amounts to 80% of lost earnings. Some cantons have created special coronavirus websitesExternal link to help facilitate requests and answer common questions. It also specifies what documentation companies need to provide to prove that they were affected by the coronavirus. In addition to production slumps, official measures taken by the government is also a reason to request compensation. After the government’s announced a ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people last Friday, cantons expect more requests to come in. Thus far, companies that have requested support largely come from the tourist industry as well as retail, especially in Lucerne and Bern, which are popular destinations for Chinese tourist groups. Some cantons have also received requests from companies suffering from manufacturing and logistical disruptions. Four companies have applied to the canton Aargau authorities for support due to supply bottlenecks for goods from China, Korea or Italy. According to a report from the Swiss public television, only five companies applied for reduced-work compensation in February from the Zurich region, but this is expected to rise as the office has received many requests for information about the requirements to reduce hours.

The measures – effective immediately – include avoiding handshakes, disposing of used tissues in a sealed waste bin, and phoning the doctor’s office first rather than showing up in person. This doubles the number of official Swiss health rules to six: Last week, the Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link issued the first three: wash your hands thoroughly, stay home if you have a fever and a cough, and cough and sneeze into a paper tissue or the crook of your arm, as demonstrated in this video:  The Swiss government took an unprecedented measure last Friday to take over powers from the cantonal authorities to ban large gatherings in order to contain the spread of the virus. The health office has also opened a coronavirus hotline that is answered 24 hours a day: +41 58 463 00 00.

2020-03-02;‘Geneva Cities Hub’ opens doors;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva_-geneva-cities-hub--opens-doors/45591036;The Swiss authorities have launched a new initiative in Geneva to strengthen ties between cities and city networks around the world and the various international organisations and players based in Switzerland.  Rather than creating yet another cities network, the aim of the new project is to help facilitate cities’ access to International Geneva, its institutions and experts, the organisers said on Monday at the Geneva launch of the Geneva Cities HubExternal link.  “This is a fundamental new component for International Geneva,” said Sami Kanaan, president of the new association based in the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  In 2007, the world's urban population surpassed the world's rural population for the first time in human history. The United Nations forecasts that by 2050 cities will contain 68% of the world's population.  Governments are important for setting the agenda and laws but cities are key actors in making change happen locally on a host of issues such as climate change. On the new coronavirus outbreak, for example, decision-making falls to national authorities but the crisis has created various challenges related to social issues and solidarity in cities, said Kanaan.  The Geneva Cities Hub is supported by the city and canton of Geneva, and the Swiss federal authorities. The new association has an initial budget of CHF350,000 ($366,000) for 2020 and CHF500,000 for 2021. It will be staffed by three people by the end of this year.  The platform will bring together national and local governments, UN agencies, scientists, NGOs and the private sector around thematic issues. It plans to establish partnerships with UN-Habitat, which is responsible for the World Urban Forum,External link city networks and with the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).External link The latter will organize the first Global Mayors’ ForumExternal link next October in Geneva.  The Geneva Cities Hub will probably plan a summit of city networks by the end of the year, added its interim director Kamelia Kemileva.

2020-02-28;Switzerland bans major public events to slow spread of virus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_switzerland-bans-events-with-more-than-1-000-people/45585378;Switzerland has imposed a ban on public events that gather more than 1,000 people together in the same place until at least March 15 in response to the coronavirus threat. The ban comes into force with immediate effect in the midst of the carnival season which draws thousands of revellers to many Swiss towns and cities. It also affects sports events across the country and has prompted the organisers of the international motor show in GenevaExternal link and the BaselworldExternal link watch fair to cancel their gatherings this year. There are currently no travel restrictions for entry into Switzerland, according to the Federal Office of Public Health. Find more details about the situation in Switzerland on the official website.External link The government's top priority is to protect the population. It is responding to the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic and has categorised the situation in Switzerland as ‘special' in terms of the Epidemics Act, the government said in a statementExternal link on Friday. This marks the first time in recent Swiss history that such a country-wide ban of large scale event has been enforced under the 2016 epidemics law. It notably limits the powers of the 26 cantonal authorities mainly in charge of health matters. At the moment, the situation is still under control, but it can change quickly, warned Interior Minister Alain Berset at a news conference on Friday. He said that the nationwide ban was part of the government's strategy which would be adapted if necessary. The latest measures provide for more coherence and improve coordination, Berset said. But the government is aware that the measures will have a significant impact on public life and on the economy. He added that big office buildings, public transports, ski resorts or army barracks are not affected directly by the ban at this stage, as individual hygiene measures can be applied there. Public or private events attracting fewer than 1,000 people are subject to approval by the cantonal authorities. Heidi Hanselmann, president of the cantonal health directors, said the cantons would implement the national measures. Further steps, including hospitals and public schools, would remain a cantonal responsibility for the moment. Switzerland currently has 15 cases of infections with corononavirus and about 100 people have been quarantined. The figures are likely to rise in the next few days, said Berset. Daniel Koch, senior expert on communicable diseases at the Federal Health Office, said there has been no case of Covid-19 infection within Switzerland. It's believed that there is not a large number of unrecorded cases at this stage in Switzerland, unlike the situation in neighbouring Italy and Germany. The first confirmed coronavirus case in Switzerland was announced on Tuesday. Numbers of infected people have been growing throughout the week and the number of tests on suspected cases has been ramped up. Some major events, including two watch fairs, the Engadine ski marathon and carnivals in the southern canton of Ticino, bordering Italy, have already been cancelled. Ice hockey matches in Ticino will also be played behind closed doors without fans, it had previously been stated. On February 17, the Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions, which was due to take place at the end of March, announced that it had been postponed by six months due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The Geneva International Motor Show, which attracts around 500,000 people every year, scheduled for March 5-15, was also cancelled. Officials at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva said they were assessing the Swiss decision but would “obviously follow the host country position”. “That being said, in our initial assessment we don’t see until March 15 any gathering here of more than 1,000 people apart from the UN Human Rights Council,” said Alessandra Vellucci, director of the United Nations Information Service. The 43rd session of the council is currently underway with over 1,000 international participants discussing various human rights issues.

2020-02-28;Health detectives deployed in fight against coronavirus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/tracking-contact_health-detectives-deployed-to-contain-spread-of-coronavirus-/45585452;To slow the spread of Covid-19, all those who have been in close contact with a contaminated person must be tracked down. The Swiss authorities have entrusted this detective work to a handful of experts.  As the focus is turning towards the cancellation of big events, these experts are doing a less publicised but equally vital job. It involves reconstructing the chain of contamination, which is known in medical jargon as contact tracing . The aim is to find out whether an infected person has already infected others, as Daniel Koch, head of the Communicable Diseases Section of the Federal Office of Public Health told Swiss television SRFExternal link.  The epidemiological investigation starts with an interview of the patient, asking him or her to list all persons with whom they have been in close contact in the two days preceding the onset of the first symptoms. People with whom the patient has interacted with for at least 15 minutes at a distance of less than two metres are considered to be at high risk of infection, Dr. Thomas Hasler of the University of Zurich’s Institute of Epidemiology told swissinfo.ch.  The investigation may involve dozens of people, depending on the habits and mobility of the infected person. In France, one of the patients diagnosed as positive for coronavirus gave a list of 60 names.  Once identified, these people are contacted and informed. Those who present a high risk of infection are asked to stay at home and contact the authorities if symptoms appear. People who live with this high-risk group must move away temporarily, Brian Martin, a cantonal doctor in Zurich, told the daily Neue Zürcher ZeitungExternal link. The quarantine lasts 14 days.  If it is a group of people who have to be quarantined - for example, those who were on the same plane or bus as the patient - the scenario is different. In this case, the authorities provide a specific place to stay.  The people least at risk can leave their homes, but they must monitor their body temperature and report any changes immediately.  One of the difficulties with this approach is that it is not always possible to identify all the people who have come into close contact with the patient, especially if he or she has taken public transport, or taken part in a mass demonstration, Hasler adds.  Contact tracing is not new and is part of the regular activities of the cantonal doctors' offices. For example, these investigations are carried out when a person tests positive for the measles virus.  Epidemiological investigations follow standardised World Health Organisation protocolsExternal link. At the international level, these have also been used during other epidemics, such as SARS in 2002-2003 or Ebola in 2014.  In canton Zurich, 17 detectives were operational by mid-February, according to the NZZ. To cope with the current spread of Covid-19, the health authorities are training new experts among the specialist staff at the University Hospital of Zurich, the Centre for Travel Medicine and the Lung League.  However, if the virus were to infect a large number of people and spread widely like a typical seasonal flu, tracing contact would no longer make sense. It would simply become impossible to trace all potential contagions.   This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-02-27;Carnival in Ticino, Engadin ski marathon among cancelled events;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/watches---wonders_geneva-watch-fair-cancelled-over-coronavirus-fears/45582792;Authorities have announced that all events for the Carnival celebration in Ticino scheduled to start on Thursday have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. This follows other major event cancellations in several big cities. The Engadin Ski Marathon scheduled to take place on March 8 in Graubunden, has also been cancelled after two coronavirus cases were confirmed in the canton.  Some 14,000 athletes take part in Switzerland's largest mass sporting event.  Meanwhile in Ticino, where the first case in Switzerland was found, two major ice hockey tournaments will be played without spectators.  On Thursday, organisers of the first Watches & Wonders Geneva – the former Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) - also announced they were cancelling their annual watch fair due to take place from April 25-29, amid fears over the new coronavirus outbreak.  The organisers said in a statementExternal link published on Thursday that they had cancelled the upcoming event in the Swiss city “to protect the health and wellbeing of all our guests, press, partners and teams”.  “In view of the latest developments concerning the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, it is the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie’s duty, as organizer of Watches & Wonders Geneva, to anticipate the potential risks that travels and important international gatherings could entail,” it said.  Watches & Wonders Geneva brings together some 30 watch brands, including those of the multinational Richemont as well as other independent watchmakers.  This is the latest Swiss watch event to be cancelled after the Swatch Group called off its “Time to Move” watch fair in Zurich, due to take place from February 28 to March 2, because of coronavirus fears. There is no news about whether the upcoming Baselworld watch fair will take place (April 30 to May 6).  On February 17, the Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions, which was due to take place at the end of March, announced that it had been postponed by six months due to the coronavirus outbreak.  On Wednesday, the Geneva International Motor Show, which attracts around 500,000 people every year, issued a statement saying it would be going ahead as scheduled from March 5-15. This followed an evaluation of the situation with the cantonal health authorities, it said in a statement. However, there are reports that carmakers are reducing staffattending Geneva's car show next week. Travel restrictions and fears over the spread of the virus have already caused postponement or cancellation of other trade fairs, including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Frankfurt's Light + Building fair and the Beijing Auto Show. The new coronavirus has infected about 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.  The Swiss authorities confirmed three new coronavirus cases on Thursday - including one in Geneva - taking the total to four across the country.

2020-02-27;Swiss hotel industry enjoyed record year in 2019;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/tourism_swiss-hotel-industry-enjoyed-record-year-in-2019/45583872;The Swiss hotel industry registered 39.6 million overnight stays across the country last year – a new record. However, tourism officials expect the Covid-19 outbreak to have an impact in 2020.  The total number of overnight stays rose by 1.9% (+755,000) compared to 2018, confirming a recent upward trend, the Federal Statistical Office reported on ThursdayExternal link.  Some 21.6 million overnight stays were booked by foreign visitors (+1.1%/+246 000), while demand was also strong among Swiss holidaymakers (+509,000/+2.9%).  There was a large rise in the number of Americans (+234 000 overnight stays / +7.7%), and sizeable increases from China (excluding Hong Kong/+2.4%), Hong Kong (+22.9%), Taiwan (+23.7%) and Japan (+6,900 / +1.8%).  Meanwhile, the number of overnight stays by visitors from Gulf states fell by 82,000 (–8.7%) while the figure for Europe was down slightly, with Italy, Spain, Britain and France recording the biggest declines.  Most Swiss regions benefited, with Zurich, Valais, Graubünden and Bern enjoying sizeable increases. Tourism officials are anxiously watching the unfolding coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact. Chinese holidaymakers, especially group holiday tours, represent the third biggest source of overnight stays in Switzerland after Germans and the Americans. In five years, the number of overnight stays by Chinese visitors has increased by 48.8% to 1.8 million in 2019.  However, Martin Nydegger, the director of Switzerland Tourism, expects a 50% drop in Chinese visitors to Switzerland in the first quarter of the year, compared to 2019, with the Bernese Oberland, central Switzerland and Zurich likely to be the most affected regions.  In January, Switzerland Tourism initially predicted a 30-50% reduction in the number of Chinese visitors to Switzerland. Tourism officials stressed that most visitors (70%) come during the summer months.  Chinese visitors are among the biggest spenders when holidaying in Switzerland: paying out on average CHF380 per person per day. In 2019 income from Chinese visitors was estimated to be CHF701.4 million.

2020-02-27;Swiss foundation launches ‘emergency call’ for coronavirus research;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-foundation-launches--emergency-call--for-coronavirus-research/45583076;The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) announced on Wednesday that it is allocating several million Swiss francs to research on coronaviruses. Matthias Egger, President of the National Research Council of SNSF, said that the private foundation will launch an emergency call for proposals on research into coronaviruses on March 6, 2020 with a submission deadline at the end of March. The letter published on Twitter states that “research proposals should have the potential to contribute to the understanding of the virus or to improve the clinical or public health response within a timeframe of two years.” This is the first time that the SNSF has launched a call for proposals in response to an emergency and based on what it learns in this experience it plans to develop criteria to define when and how to react to future emergencies. The SNSF was founded on August 1, 1952 with a mandate by the federal government. It aims to provide financial support for research projects in all academic disciplines and promote young scientists. With its mandate from the federal government to fund research and promote young scientists in Switzerland, the foundation supports approximately 8,500 researchers every year. On Thursday, the Swiss authorities confirmed three new coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking the total to four across the country. Ten laboratories in Switzerland can currently carry out coronavirus tests. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-02-26;Switzerland beefs up coronavirus testing capacity ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/diagnosis-_switzerland-beefs-up-coronavirus-testing-capacity-/45581796;Ten laboratories in Switzerland can now carry out coronavirus tests, Health Minister Alain Berset announced on Wednesday. Prior to Monday they were all done by one laboratory in Geneva.   The ten laboratories can together perform 1,000 tests per day, he told a press conference, noting that capacity has been almost tripled since last week.   Berset said Tuesday’s confirmation of a first coronavirus case in Switzerland did not change the measures put in place on Monday.   The coronavirus patient, an elderly man from the southern canton of Ticino, is in isolation in a clinic in Lugano and is reported to be doing well.  On Monday, the government decided to beef up measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus from neighbouring Italy, including tests for people with flu-like symptoms and stepping up information and advisory services.    Berset said a campaign of information for travellers and commuters at borders and airports would start on Thursday, with flyers and posters. A hygiene campaign will be launched the same day and the existing telephone hotline strengthened.  The telephone hotline has been inundated with calls, according to operator Medgate. Most calls have been about travel  to Asia and Italy, and what hygiene steps to protect against infection. Meanwhile, the foreign ministry says several Swiss citizens have been quarantined in a hotel in Tenerife after some Italian guests there tested positive for coronavirus. The ministry says the Swiss, whose exact number is not clear, are well, and that it is in contact with them and the relevant Spanish authorities. And the Lufthansa airline group, which includes Swiss International Airlines, has suspended all passenger flights to mainland China until the end of March as a result of the virus outbreak, and reduced flights to Hong Kong. Swiss will now fly to Hing Kong only five times a week instead of every day, and will use smaller planes.  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-02-26;Coronavirus: Head-shaking doctors and non-hand-shaking workers;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus--head-shaking-doctors-and-non-hand-shaking-workers/45580772;A day after the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Switzerland, newspaper headlines include companies banning handshakes and doctors accusing the government of “irresponsibly” underestimating the danger.  “There’s absolutely no point in spreading panic, and the public mustn’t be intimated,” says Christian AlthausExternal link, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern. “But they must know that an epidemic will come to Switzerland.”  On Tuesday the Federal Office of Public Health said a 70-year-old man had tested positive for the coronavirus in the southern canton of Ticino, on the border with Italy. Althaus has been highly critical of the health office, which in his view has “irresponsibly misjudged” the danger of COVID-19. In a tweet he warned that Switzerland faced one of the “greatest health emergencies in its recent history” and pointedly suggested the government invest in epidemic planning instead of fighter jets. In an interviewExternal link with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) on Wednesday, he continued his criticism, saying he could imagine that the public health office, which says the risk to the publicExternal link is “moderate”, has too few experts able to assess the complex epidemiological issues.  “And unfortunately, there’s relatively little communication between experts within Switzerland as well as abroad who could supply this information and support the health office,” he said.  Althaus says a worst-case scenario of 30,000 deaths in Switzerland “can’t be ruled out” and warns about hospitals not being able to cope. When the NZZ pointed out that initial estimates of the 2009 swine flu turned out to be much too pessimistic, he said he’d be “delighted” if he and all the other experts were completely wrong, “but unfortunately it’s very unlikely”.  He admitted that with hindsight people overreacted in 2009, “but the situation now is totally different. I can imagine that [the swine flu] story continues to have an influence at the health office. That’s why people there assume, based pretty much on a gut feeling, that the current epidemic will play out like the one 11 years ago”.  The World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources are estimating the infection rate of COVID-19 is higher than seasonal flu and swine flu but considerably lower than measles. Swiss public televisionExternal link SRF says latest WHO figures put the mortality rate of COVID-19 at about 3.4% in China and about 1.1% outside China. Althaus was supported by the president of the Ticino Medical Association. “The Federal Office of Public Health has underestimated the problems for canton Ticino and the events in Lombardy,” Franco Denti told 20MinutenExternal link on Tuesday.  “Until last Friday the health office certainly did not act correctly. Just wearing masks, as per their recommendations, is nowhere near enough. We expect clear answers and measures to help stop and limit the epidemic,” he said.  So what should people be doing? While the WHO has detailed adviceExternal link on how individuals can protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper in Zurich says “there’s only one thingExternal link that protects people from the virus – and everyone’s doing it wrong”.  “Only handwashing is reliable protection against viral and bacterial diseases,” it says, pointing out that “more than 90%” of people aren’t doing it properly: thumbs and fingertips are apparently often overlooked. In its online article, the Tages-Anzeiger included a WHO video on correct handwashing technique. Perhaps aware of this, a range of Swiss companies have told employees to avoid shaking hands.  A poster in a canteen of cement company Holcim in eastern Switzerland shows a handshake in the middle of a red “forbidden” sign. The poster didn’t explicitly mention coronavirus, but one Holcim worker told 20MinutenExternal link that while it frightened some employees, “others, like me, think it’s good that our company is providing clear instructions”. Holcim said it simply wanted to raise awareness among staff.  Telecoms operator Swisscom advised workers on its intranet to avoid touching their faces, to wash their hands frequently, and to not shake hands. “The same protective measures apply as for seasonal flu,” said spokeswoman Sabrina Hubacher.  Retail giant Coop and the Swiss Post also said they had advised staff to follow standard hygiene measures.  “With an epidemic we also recommend not shaking hands or greeting people with a kiss, as well as keeping a distance of a metre when talking to someone,” said Post spokesman Erich Goetschi.

2020-02-25;Switzerland confirms first coronavirus case;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_switzerland-confirms-first-coronavirus-case/45579278;Switzerland reported its first coronavirus case on Tuesday in canton Ticino in the south of the country which borders Italy.  Laboratory tests carried out in Geneva uncovered a coronavirus case in canton Ticino, authorities said on Tuesday. The Federal Office of Public Health told reporters in Bern that the male patient was in his seventies and had been infected in the Milan region of Italy during an event on February 15. The first symptoms appeared two days later, explained FOPH director Pascal Strupler. The pensioner has remained with his family ever since. He is now in isolation at a clinic in Lugano, canton Ticino, but is said to be doing well. Those who have been in contact with him will be tested and placed in quarantine to monitor their condition over the next 14 days. According to FOPH, this first case does not change the risk assessment in Switzerland. At present the new coronavirus poses only a moderate ri sk to the population, health officials say. “We are still in a normal situation,” Strupler added. However, the probability of further cases being diagnosed is increasing. Medical institutions are prepared to carry out early detection and testing of suspected cases.  They said it was not necessary at this stage to take further measures, such as closing schools. New measures would be considered if authorities had the impression that virus transmission was not under control. So far, around 300 suspected cases of Covid-19 have been tested in Switzerland, but there had been no confirmed cases until now, according to the interior ministry.  Daniel Koch, head of the department of communicable diseases at the FOPH, said there were currently 70 outstanding suspected cases in Switzerland being tested, spread throughout the country - including several in cantons Bern and Basel but only a small number in canton Ticino. Test results will be known in the coming hours, he said.  On Monday the Swiss authorities announced that they were beefing up measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus from neighbouring Italy, while stressing that the situation in Switzerland is under control.  Tests for the Covid-19 virus will also be made available to people who have flu-like symptoms but have not necessarily been in close contact with infected patients, according to the interior ministryExternal link. An information campaign as well as advisory servicesExternal link will be boosted in the next few days.  An information campaign with flyers and posters has been launched at borders and airports for travellers and commuters. Public transport staff and border guards will receive specific instructions. A hotlineExternal link has been strengthened and a hygiene campaign will be launched in the coming days. The Swiss announcement comes as neighbouring Austria also reported its first two confirmed cases on Tuesday. The two patients are Italians who live in the border province of Tyrol and recently travelled to Lombardy, one of the two regions at the epicentre of the Italian outbreak. Austria has had more than 200 suspected cases so far but all had tested negative. The number of cases in Italy has ballooned from three last Friday to 322 confirmed cases and 11 deaths, most in Lombardy and neighbouring Veneto. Italian authorities have rushed to seal off the worst affected towns but the virus has continued to spread and authorities reported an infection in Sicily, the first case south of Rome, on Tuesday. Swiss Interior Minister Alain Berset was in the Italian capital, Rome, on Tuesday, meeting his counterparts from Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Slovenia to discuss the outbreak and cross-border coordination. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally has risen above 80,000. It has killed more than 2,600 people, most in China, and spread to some 29 other countries.

2020-02-25;Coronavirus: Ticino and its cross-border workers from Italy;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covis-19_coronavirus--how-to-deal-with-cross-border-workers-from-italy/45578368;The southern Swiss canton of Ticino is just a few kilometres from the main hotbeds of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Italy. More than a quarter of the cantonal workforce commutes from Italy every day, and some locals want the federal government to close the border.  Why could the virus soon arrive in canton Ticino?  The Ticino border is just a hundred kilometres or so from the municipality of Lodi, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Italy. With its road and rail tunnels under the Gotthard massif, Ticino is the main Alpine transit route between Italy and central and northern Europe.  But when it comes to the risk of contagion, transit passengers are less of a worry for the canton than the 67,800 Italian cross-border workers who come into close contact with the local population on a daily basis. Most of these commuters come from Lombardy, the Italian region most affected by the coronavirus.  So far about 300 suspected cases of COVID-19 have been investigated in Switzerland but all have tested negative, Home Affairs Minister Alain Berset said on Monday. However, the virus has been contracted by some Swiss travellers in Asia, who were then placed in quarantine.  Is there an argument for shutting the border?  Closing the border between Italy and Ticino is a decision for the Swiss federal authorities. However, the government doesn’t intend to take such a measure, which was recently demanded by representatives of the right-wing protest movement Lega dei Ticinesi.  The Federal Office of Public HealthExternal link says the situation in northern Italy is worrying, but these are local outbreaks and it’s still too early to speak of a wave [of cases] engulfing Switzerland.  On the other hand, in the event of an actual outbreak in Europe, it would be impossible to stop the spread of the virus with such measures since the continent is too closely interconnected. France and Austria have also kept their borders with Italy open, although Austria temporarily halted cross-border rail traffic.  Why can’t the Ticino economy do without cross-border workers?  More than 67,800 cross-border commuters work in Ticino and their number has doubled since 2002, i.e. since the introduction of the agreement on the free movement of persons between Switzerland and the European Union. Only canton Geneva employs more people who cross the border every day (87,104). This is followed by Basel City (33,932) and Vaud (32,425).  Cross-border commuters account for more than a quarter of the total workforce in Ticino. Whereas cross-border workers traditionally worked mainly in construction and industry, today almost two-thirds are active in the tertiary sector (services).  In practice, cross-border workers are now present in every branch of the economy, including the public sector. Closing the border therefore risks paralysing a large part of the Ticino economy, jeopardising many basic services for the population. Among the sectors most affected would be the hospital sector: about half of the nursing staff are foreign and a fifth are cross-border workers.

2020-02-24;Swiss step up precautions to prevent spread of coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_swiss-step-up-precautions-to-prevent-spread-of-coronavirus/45576814;Authorities have decided to beef up measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus from neighbouring Italy, while stressing that the situation in Switzerland is under control.  Tests for the Covid-19 virus will also be made available to people who have flu-like symptoms but have not necessarily been in close contact with infected patients, according to the interior ministryExternal link. An information campaign as well as advisory servicesExternal link will be boosted in the next few days.  Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Interior Minister Alain Berset said the Swiss government was in regular contact with the health authorities in neighbouring countries and was ready to take further measures if necessary.  “We are well prepared if the situation worsens. Cooperation with the cantonal authorities [primarily in charge of health matters] has worked well and we are also part of a European health alarm and response system,” Berset said. Switzerland shares borders with four countries but is not a member of the European Union. The southern Ticino region has close economic links with northern Italy, notably through the estimated 68,000 Italian cross-border commuters. So far, about 300 suspected cases of Covid-19 have been tested in Switzerland, but there has been no confirmed cases, according to the interior ministry. Berset said a national panel would evaluate the situation regularly and discuss further steps if necessary.  Among the latest precautions, the authorities plan to step up an awareness campaign using posters at airports and railway stations, as well as  instructions for border guards and public transport personnel. The resources at test laboratories will also be increased, said Pascal Strupler, head of the Federal Office for Public Health. He assured that the  measures taken so far are sufficient to deal with the current situation in Switzerland. However, he added that further steps, including the cancellation of public events, could be considered if deemed necessary by local organisers or by cantonal authorities. An infected patient and others who have been in close contact with him or her will be isolated in quarantine, said Daniel Koch, expert on communicable diseases at the Federal Health Office. He assured there were enough places at hospitals in Switzerland to cope with a potential epidemic. Hans-Peter Lenz, head of the foreign ministry’s crisis management centre, said they had no information at this stage of any Swiss citizen in Italy or in South Korea affected by coronavirus.  He said there are about 33,000 registered expatriate Swiss citizens in northern Italy, where the virus appears to have spread fast over the past few days. Lenz also said all the Swiss representations in Italy were open and an  information helplineExternal link provided assistance around the clock.  He said the main concern among the expats in Italy is that the borders with Switzerland remain open.

In the letter addressed to the Federal Council this week, a group of Swiss abroad complained about the quality of communication with the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) during the outbreak, claiming that other countries were in much closer contact with their citizens. According to Swiss public televisionExternal link, RTS, the signatories of the letter also deplore a lack of moral support, pointing out that they have been working daily and for years to strengthen relations between the two countries, but that since the outbreak believe they can’t count on Swiss authorities. The group cites the fact that they are offered information from the local government but that it is all in Chinese. They are also advised to see a general practitioner – something which is not common in China. Unlike the five Swiss and three Chinese family members who were repatriated on Sunday, the group is not interested in leaving China as many have lived in the country for years, often with family and Chinese partners. Unlike some other countries, Switzerland does not advise its citizens to leave China. On the same day, the Swiss Ambassador to China, Bernardino Regazzoni, released a video addressed to the Swiss abroad in China, in which he indicated that the government has been working since the beginning of the outbreak to support its citizens with the first most urgent priority being the evacuation of those who want to leave Hubei province, the epicentre of the health emergency. He said that the foreign affairs department is available to support people 24 hours a day through a hotlineExternal link and WeChat. There are about 3,500 Swiss nationals registered with the Swiss representation in China and a spokesperson from the FDFA confirmed that they have been in contact with them. She added that the information in the ambassador's video has been sent to Swiss nationals in other forms and that the FDFA is in the process of gathering the necessary information to respond to the letter in detail.  The FDFA also stressed that they have also received expressions of thanks from Swiss nationals who are pleased with authorities’ support.

Earlier this week, a BBC story asked why more pharmaceutical companies aren’t rushing to develop a global vaccineExternal link to tackle the coronavirus as the number of cases and deaths from Covid-19 climb. “One would expect the major pharmaceutical firms to make millions, even billions, by rushing to develop a vaccine,” the reporter writes. If only it was so easy. There are a host of challengesExternal link to developing a vaccine quickly in the middle of an outbreak and between the research and manufacturing costs combined with the approval process, it’s no wonder that some companies are inclined to stay away. Swiss companies aren’t the biggest players in vaccines, but some are bringing other parts of the business to the table. Roche was the first company to develop a diagnostic test for the novel virusExternal link according to an interview with its CEO in January. However, it has played down optimismExternal link that it’s flu treatment Xofluza could work against the Covid-19. The whole situation raises a much more fundamental and complex question about the current R&D model. The BBC story highlights how companies that developed vaccines for Ebola were saddled with hefty costs and no sales channel after the emergency waned. Similar problems are being found in the antibiotics business, which is suffering serious shortagesExternal link especially as antimicrobial resistance rises. Juxtapose this with the gene therapy business, where companies are in a fierce battle to buy up the next big breakthrough and you can see where companies are putting their R&D resources. An in-depth data analysis by Swiss public television RTS found that 16 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies have acquired smaller companies to the tune of $1.2 trillion in the last 20 years. Many of these are for innovative cell and gene therapies for rare diseases that are expected to be big moneymakers for companies. Roche and Novartis top the acquisition chart swallowing 49 and 45 companies respectively in the last 20 years. The research also shows that many of these smaller companies relied heavily on public and charitable funds in the early stages. So, how will we solve the biggest health threats if there’s no money in it? Could this recent effort External linkout of Norway be an option? Tell me what you think jessica.davis@swissinfo.ch The coronavirus is not just putting pressure on the pharmaceutical industry. It is also impacting business continuity across transport, retail and manufacturing. Swiss International Airlines extended flight cancellations until the end of February, Nestlé shut 30 or so factoriesExternal link in China, Swatch cancelled its “Time to Move” watch fair, and engineering firm ABB has closed all its plants in its second-largest market. The #cryptoleaks scandal has shaken Switzerland. There’s been a lot of talk here about what the revelations that the CIA and German intelligence used Swiss firm Crypto AG’s technology to decode other nations’ top-secret message means for the country’s foreign relations and reputation for neutrality. But there are a host of other important questions about how much oversight the government has and should have over the activities of companies setting up shop in the country. What safeguards are really in place to ensure that companies aren’t using Switzerland’s “neutral” host status and loose regulations to do as they please in other countries? More are demanding a formal investigation into how illegal gold from Venezuela arrives in Switzerland. As the economic situation in Venezuela deteriorates, more people are turning to illegal mining of gold that ends up in Swiss refineriesExternal link via third party country such as Curaçao or the Cayman Islands. Last year, Switzerland imported 2.5 tonnes of gold from Curaçao, which curiously enough doesn’t have any mines. FINMA opened an investigation into money laundering but so far, nothing open related to illegal trade. Marc Ummel from the NGO SWISSAID told Swiss public television RTS that “the day when dirty gold doesn’t arrive in the Swiss market, illegal groups will cease to exist.” Thanks for reading.

Swiss Post is currently only able to operate around a third of the capacity required for shipments to China.   “Consequently, Swiss Post is no longer accepting any letters or parcels addressed to China in its Swiss Post branches or branches with partners with immediate effect and until further notice,” stated the company.  Letters and parcels that must absolutely be sent to China can be deposited by customers using the Urgent shipping option. However, Swiss Post is currently no longer able to guarantee delivery times.  As far as receiving postal deliveries from China is concerned it is China Post that bears the responsibility.

2020-02-11;Shadow boxing a virus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/inside-geneva_shadow-boxing-a-virus/45548920;‘To put it bluntly: we’re shadow boxing.’ These were the words of the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, one week after the WHO declared the novel coronavirus to be an international public health emergency.  There is much we still don’t know about the virus, he explained. Exactly how easily it is transmitted, how severe its impact on health might be, and even its precise origin. Animals yes, but which ones, scientists are not yet sure.  Those same scientists will tell you this uncertainty is hardly a surprise. This is a brand-new virus, never seen in humans before. It only came to notice a few short weeks ago. Its genome was sequenced within a few days, at a speed described by one virus expert as “unprecedented and completely unbelievable”. Sequencing the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, virus took months. But that step alone does not bring clarity about what exactly this virus is, let alone effective treatments or vaccines. Those will take rigorous research, multiple clinical trials, lots of money, and lots of time.  And while we wait, an anxious world fills the knowledge vacuum with rumour, and misinformation.  “It’s a monster with multiple faces and arms,” said Sylvie Briand, WHO director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness describing the ‘infodemic’ which has accompanied the actual epidemic. Just a few days later, the WHO director general himself warned against “trolls and conspiracy theories”.  As we battle to contain and understand the coronavirus, we are beginning to understand that our interconnected world poses huge challenges. Not just because millions of people travel between continents on a daily basis, allowing disease to spread more easily, but because, with one click of a smartphone, misinformation about that same disease can be shared with millions too.  Here are just a few of the rumours about the coronavirus that I have seen or heard in the last couple of weeks.  Eating onions, garlic, black pepper, or chilis, will protect against it. Not true, but at least, as Sylvie Briand pointed out, not especially harmful, as eating these things won’t make people ill, or put them at risk.  Then there are the multiple videos on social media, showing people apparently dropping like flies in Chinese supermarkets or on the streets. And videos of people dressed in full body protective clothing, also carrying weapons, rounding other people up. Are these real? No one can say for sure. They are virtually impossible to verify.  Meanwhile, over in Russia one of the leading nightly news programmes has been promoting a conspiracy theory suggesting that the coronavirus somehow originated in the United States, possibly with Donald Trump himself. Highly unlikely of course, but a good yarn which will have viewers coming back for more.  And finally, most potentially damaging of all, is the suggestion that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs used to treat HIV might also help against the virus. At time of writing, there is no firm evidence for this, only the merest inconclusive hint from trials dating back to the SARS epidemic. Nevertheless, the rumour has grown wings, and already there is talk of an ARV shortage, striking fear into millions of HIV positive people who rely on these drugs.  So concerned is the WHO about the rumours and misinformation, that it has warned they could undermine the global response to defeat the virus. In a bid to get the truth out, the organization has devoted a team to work with social media giants to make sure hard facts take priority over unfounded rumours.  The WHO’s own website now has a prominent page devoted to combating rumoursExternal link, directed not just at member states and health professionals, but at all of us. There we can read about how to protect ourselves, about travel advice, we can get answers to the most common questions, and there is a page devoted to ‘Myth-busters’.  For Gian Luca-Burci, former legal counsel to the WHO and now adjunct professor of international law at Geneva’s Graduate Institute, this is a welcome development, and a sign that lessons have been learned by everyone since the SARS outbreak way back in 2003.  “This is guidance the world is looking for, and that to me is the big lesson of SARS,” he said. “One of the things about international organisations is that they are created by member states and they are supposed to serve states. But if you put all this stuff on the web, you bypass states, you go straight to the hospital, to the person. That is a big development of the 21st century.”  But whatever the WHO does to approach medical staff, businesses, and ordinary people directly, member states and their approach remain hugely important.  Although all countries have expressed support for China in its bid to tackle the virus, many have also introduced flight bans, and issued travel advice to their citizens, far in excess of the WHO’s own recommendations.  As a consequence, China’s economy is taking a multi-billion-dollar hit, and, cynics might suggest, there will be some governments, watching China’s emergence as an economic powerhouse, who are not distraught.  A little hint of that ‘Schadenfreude’ could be seen in the very controversial cover of Der Spiegel magazine, showing a frightening looking figure in hazmat clothing, with the headline ‘made in China.’  “It is the most politicised outbreak we have ever known,” said Dr Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Geneva Graduate Institute, “Regardless of how well the public health authorities do in making clear understandable messages to the public, we live in a time where people don’t have faith in the traditional sources of information, whether that’s traditional media like the BBC or traditional authorities like medical journals or the WHO.”  This outbreak is still in its early stages. While, in the last couple of days, there have been some hints that it may be stabilizing in China, with fewer daily new cases than last week, it is still too early to be sure, the WHO cautions. Viruses can slow down, and then come roaring back.  And so patience is required, for the virus to take its course, for the containment measures to work, and for the research into transmissibility, severity, and new treatments to yield answers.  But patience and sound, science-based advice can be hard to find, amidst the deluge of headlines, fears, and rumour. That old saying ‘a lie is half round the world before the truth has got its trousers on’, has never seemed so true.  You can follow Imogen Foulkes on twitter at @imogenfoulkes, and send her questions and suggestions for UN topics.

2020-02-07;Swiss industries brace for impact of coronavirus outbreak;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business-cost_swiss-industries-brace-for-impact-of-coronavirus-outbreak/45543110;Various Swiss industries and the domestic tourism sector are preparing themselves for a downturn caused by the coronavirus epidemic. China is Switzerland’s third-largest trading partner behind the European Union and the United States. China has resorted to a virtual lockdown in a bid to contain the contagion that has infected 28,000 people and killed more than 560. Swiss International Air Lines and its parent company Lufthansa have suspended flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until the end of the month, while other destinations have been affected. Swiss companies operating in mainland China have been forced to scale back or suspend production as staff are forced to stay at home. Engineering firm ABB has closed all its plants in its second-largest market, which accounted for 15% – $4 billion (CHF3.9 billion) – of its revenues last year. The chemical and pharmaceutical industries have also been hit, according to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper. It reportsExternal link that a new plant built by the chemicals firm Zofinger has been shut since January 25. Many of the 7,000 Novartis staff and the 10,000 workers employed by Roche in China have been forced to work at home rather than in laboratories. But both multinationals say they have plans in place to cope with such emergencies. The body representing the Swiss electrical engineering, precision tools and machine building sectors told swissinfo.ch that some members had been forced to suspend production but that it was too early to calculate the impact of these disruptions on trade. In the first nine months of 2019, China absorbed more than CHF15 billion of Swiss exports, while goods travelling the other way totalled some CHF11 billion. The longer the epidemic goes on, the greater the risk of these figures being dented this year. Swiss tourism officials expect a 30-50% drop in the number of big-spending Chinese visitors to Switzerland in the coming weeks. Based on 2018 figures, this could represent 70,000-100,000 overnight stays per month.  Swiss watch exports, which already suffered last year from the riots in Hong Kong, may also take a battering. Switzerland’s largest watch manufacturer, Swatch, has cancelled its “Time to Move” watch fair, which was scheduled to take place at the end of this month in Zurich, because of the coronavirus.

2020-02-07;Art Basel Hong Kong cancelled over coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/art-world_art-basel-hong-kong-cancelled-over-coronavirus/45543922;"The high-profile annual Art Basel Hong Kong has been cancelled as the city grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. The International art organisation said late Thursday that the show, scheduled to run from March 19 to 21 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, would no longer take place. Catering to the growing Asian markets, Art Basel Hong Kong External linkstarted in 2013 as a spin-off from Art Basel, the world’s biggest art fair. Art Basel External linksaid it had “no option” but to cancel the upcoming edition of Art Basel Hong Kong. “Numerous factors informed this decision, including: fundamental concern for the health and safety of all those working at and attending the fair; the severe logistical challenges facing the build-out and transit of artwork to the show; and the escalating difficulties complicating international travel, all arising as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus,” the statement said.External link Marc Spiegler, Global Director, Art Basel, said that thoughts were with those affected by the virus. “The decision to cancel Art Basel Hong Kong was an extremely difficult one for us… We are acutely aware of the important role that the fair plays within the region's cultural scene and for our galleries, both in Asia and across the globe. Our team dedicated extensive time and effort to ensure our show in March would be a success over the course of the past year. Unfortunately, the sudden outbreak and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus radically changed the situation.” Situation Hong Kong saw its first death from the virus on Tuesday. It has confirmed 22 cases, two of them critical, with at least six of the latest cases transmitted locally, authorities said. The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 630 people and infected more than 31,000, the vast majority of them in mainland China.

2020-02-06;WHO director defends Chinese over coronavirus criticism;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/2019-ncov_who-director-defends-chinese-over-coronavirus-criticism/45540534;The new coronavirus, which began in China and has spread to 31 other countries, is an epidemic with “many battlefields”, but it can be stopped via the drastic measures being imposed by Beijing and other affected governments, says a World Health Organization (WHO) director.  So far, the fast-spreading virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, has infected more than 28,000 peopleExternal link, about 99% of them in China, with the city of Wuhan the epicentre. Another 260 cases have been reported in 31 other countries and regions. At least 563 people have died in China, one person has died in Hong Kong and one person has died in the Philippines. Sylvie Briand, the UN health agency’s director of global infectious hazard preparedness, recently returned to Geneva from an official visit to Beijing with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, where they met President Xi Jinping and other health officials.  Briand describes the current outbreak as an epidemic with “multiple foci” rather than a pandemic. But she believes the virus can be stopped. “Of course, it’s challenging as there are lots of people and movements, and the virus is spreading fast. It’s not easy, but we believe it can be done,” she said.  The Chinese government has introduced dramatic “mitigation measures”, virtually locking down the central province of Hubei, home to 60 million people and its capital city of Wuhan at the centre of the outbreak. In other affected locations in China, officials are scrambling to stop transmission and prevent “a second Hubei”.  Meanwhile, outside China countries are implementing “early caseload detection”, “early isolation and treatment” and “contact tracing” strategies, explained Briand.  “Last week the Chinese were pretty confident that they could ‘win the battle’ – those are the words they use – but the situation is evolving very quickly,” she said. “There are now many battlefields and each battlefield is very different. The global picture is diverse. Fortunately, most of the affected countries have very strong health systems so we count on them to manage the situation in their own localities. But it is complex.”  On Tuesday, Tedros told a technical briefing to the WHO’s Executive Board in Geneva that there is a “window of opportunity” to stop the deadly new coronavirus becoming a broader global crisis.  “Even in places where we have a number of growing cases outside China, as long as we can trace the virus and contacts and every infected person doesn’t transmit it, we can stop the transmission,” said Briand. “It’s out of China, but not completely out of the box.” The WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, but experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.  “We’re still learning about it,” said Briand. “Its transmissibility is probably between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and flu. Regarding the severity, it’s not very clear as outside China we only have two deaths, which is very low, and inside China where they have most cases, it’s a bit higher but the case fatality ratio is decreasing. It’s less severe than we thought at the beginning.”  The coronavirus has remained “quite a stable virus”, she said.  The WHO director said most people who had died or suffered severe infections were people with underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes or suppressed immune systems, or the elderly.  She believes the low numbers of deaths outside China are probably linked to the fact that travellers were not old with chronic diseases, but younger people and those in good health.  Beijing’s authoritarian leadership meanwhile continues to face questions over its management of the crisis and having kept its citizens in the dark for weeks before infections started to explode.  “Everyone is doing their best,” Briand insisted. “I think they [Chinese authorities] have been very transparent with WHO and shared almost immediately the sequence of the virus as soon as they had it.”  She believes the Chinese leadership has learnt the lessons from the 2002 SARS outbreak, where they were criticised for withholding information about the virus for too long.  “Thanks to the system of disease monitoring that they put in place, they were able to detect cases in Wuhan. The first notification we got was very early. As soon as they detected five unusual cases, they reported them immediately to WHO. They were able to capture this virus very early on in the outbreak,” she said.  “It was especially challenging as it was in the middle of the flu season, so you had a number of pneumonia cases in hospitals and most were not caused by coronaviruses but by other viruses.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The Swiss embassy in Tokyo is in contact with the Japanese authorities.  The Swiss, whose presence was confirmed by the foreign ministry, were travelling on a cruise ship carrying around 3,700 people of dozens of nationalities.  On Tuesday, Japanese authorities detected possible cases of contamination on the ship, the Diamond Princess. The vessel had arrived on Monday evening near the port of Yokohama, south-west of Tokyo. In Hong Kong, a case of coronavirus was detected in an 80-year-old man who had previously been on board.  By Friday, there were 41 extra cases:  including 21 Japanese, 8 Americans, 5 Australians, 5 Canadians, 1 Argentinian and 1 British. The total now stands at 61 associated with the ship. The people who tested positive are to be taken to local hospitals Tests were carried out on three groups of people on board the Diamond Princess: those with suspicious symptoms, those who had disembarked during the stopover in Hong Kong, and those who had been in contact with the infected passenger.  The rest of the passengers and crew members are required to remain on board for about 14 days, the minister added, noting that doctors believe the incubation period for the coronavirus is two weeks.  The overall death toll from an outbreak of the coronavirus has risen to nearly 500. Some passengers are tweeting life on board. They are being treated well, but have some concerns such as about medicine. They are mainly keeping calm. This is a tweet from one of them.

The country is the group's second largest single market and accounted for 15% of revenues in 2019, or the equivalent of approximately $4 billion (CHF3.9 billion). Since the beginning of the week, all plants in China have been closed, explained chairman and CEO Peter Voser on Wednesday. He was speaking on a conference call to share the results of the last quarter of 2019. We want to restart capacity as quickly as possible and as normally as possible, he added.  ABB has taken various measures to protect its employees. Travel restrictions are in place, although no repatriation of foreign personnel is planned for the time being.  Voser estimated the number of employees in the Wuhan region of Hubei province, where the outbreak originated, to be around 100. He said it was too early to quantify the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the firm’s 2020 results.  Let's not speculate, he cautioned. The Chinese Lunar New Year holiday period is traditionally quiet anyway, with many employees on holiday, he noted. This is the week when production should have resumed at full capacity.

A presentation to suppliers was due to be held in Zurich from February 28 to March 2, followed by a press event from March 4-6. The Biel/Bienne-based group said it wanted to “avoid partners having to make international flights during a period of insecurity”. The World Health Organization (WHO) last week declared the flu-like virus a global emergency. It has spread from China to 23 other countries, with 20,636 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, mostly in China. The Philippines and Hong Kong have reported the first coronavirus death outside of China. No cases have been reported in Switzerland. In 2018, Swatch Group announced that it would no longer attend the world’s largest watch and jewellery fair Baselworld and decided to organize its own event to present its products.  The Swiss watch manufacturer said on Tuesday that Swatch Group’s “Prestige” brands would still present their new models in regional events. “Prestige” includes brands such as Breguet, Harry Winston, Blancpain, Glashütte Original, Jaquet Droz, Léon Hatot and Omega.

2020-02-03;SWISS extends flight cancellations to China;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_swiss-extends-flight-cancellations-to-china/45535854;Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and its parent company Lufthansa will ground planes to and from China for longer than originally planned owing to the coronavirus.  Lufthansa said in a statementExternal link on Monday that Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines flights would be suspended to and from Beijing and Shanghai until February 29 with immediate effect. Initially the flights had been suspended until February 9. “Nanjing, Shenyang and Quingdao will not be served until the end of the winter timetable on March 28. Flight operations to/from Hong Kong will continue as planned,” it said.  On Monday China decried some countries for denying entry to people from Hubei province, at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, and cancelling of flights, as going against World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations not to take unnecessary or excessive measures.  In a speech to the WHO’s executive board, which opened a six-day session in Geneva, China’s delegate said the international community needed to treat the new virus outbreak objectively, fairly, and not “deliberately create panic” among the general public.  China is facing increasing international isolation due to restrictions on flights to and from the country and bans on travellers from China.  There have been 17,238 confirmed infections in China including 361 deaths, as well as 151 confirmed cases in 23 countries and one death which was reported from the Philippines on Sunday, said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday.  Tedros said there was no need for measures that “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” in trying to halt the spread of the coronavirus.  “We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent,” Tedros told the WHO executive board, reiterating his message from last week when he declared an international emergency. By Monday evening, there have been no confirmed infections with the virus in Switzerland. A suspected case of coronavirus on board a flight to Zurich from New York turned out to be a regular case of seasonal flu, according to Zurich police. The plane was temporarily put in quarantine in Zurich for a few hours before passengers were allowed to disembark. Meanwhile, an information hotline set up by the health authorities last week appears to meet limited public interest. Medgate, the private company operating the hotline in Switzerland, said it registered about 1,000 calls over the past four days. In comparison, the information service set up for the 2009 swine flu pandemic had about 3,000 in the first few days. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

The plane was chartered by the French government to repatriate some 250 people of 30 different nationalities, including French, Belgian, Austrian, and the five Swiss. Though none of the passengers showed signs of suffering from the Coronavirus, they will spend the next 14 days quarantined in the French air base of Istres-Le-Tubé. In a press releaseExternal link on Sunday, the Swiss foreign ministry said it had worked closely with French and Chinese authorities to prepare the “voluntary” repatriation of these citizens. Initially, it was thought that 10 would return, but two chose shortly before departure to stay put in Wuhan, the foreign ministry said. All passengers on the flight underwent medical tests prior to taking off and wore masks for the duration of the flight. Flight staff wore protective suits. According to the foreign ministry, there are currently than 4,000 Swiss nationals in China and Hong Kong. Only ten were located in the vicinity of Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic that has so far claimed over 300 lives. Also on Sunday, in an interview with the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper, the Chinese ambassador in Bern said that all Chinese tourists and residents in Switzerland had been contacted.

2020-01-31;Coronavirus: how much panic should the world be in?;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/2019-ncov_coronavirus--how-much-panic-should-the-world-be-in-/45535122;"The spread of the coronavirus has been labelled a health emergency of “international scale” by the World Health Organization (WHO). And yet, the Geneva-based body has not recommended any limiting of travel to and from China. How worried should the world be? Because, viewed through a microscope, the virus looks as if it’s surrounded by a crown (“corona”, in Latin). Officially called 2019-nCoV, the virus is of the same family as SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), which appeared in China in 2003, and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), which originated in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It was probably transmitted by an animal – a snake or a bat – to a human at the market in Wuhan. In China, various sorts of meat are eaten that would not be found in western supermarkets. And to guarantee freshness, market sellers often deal in live animals. Like its predecessors, the Wuhan coronavirus can jump from animals to humans, and from humans to humans. It’s transmitted through contact with an infected animal or person – for example, intimate contact, coughing or sneezing, shared living spaces, or even being face-to-face at a distance of less than a metre. Two separate factors need to be taken into account here, says Harris Héritier, an epidemiologist: how easily the virus is spread (very easily, in the case of the 2019-nCoV), and how lethal it is, i.e. what percentage of infected people die. The New England Journal of Medicine has estimated the mortality of the coronavirus to be around 4%. By comparison, this figure was 9.5% for SARS and 34% for MERS. “We suspect so, but we base this suspicion on what happened with previous epidemics,” says Héritier. “Current statistics aren’t yet enough to say concretely if some groups are more vulnerable than others. It could also be dangerous to speculate, because we saw for example with the Spanish flu that the most vulnerable were those with a higher level of immunity.” Each year, flu kills up to 650,000 people around the world, according to WHO estimates. This amounts to just 0.1% of people who contract it. Its mortality is thus quite weak, as was that of the 1918-1919 Spanish flu (which was also spread from China, despite its name): for that disease, the rate was 2%, though it led to an estimated 50-100 million deaths. For these people, “it could look like a flu, but we don’t know all the possible symptoms, and everyone reacts quite differently,” says Héritier. “This means that many of those who had it simply stayed at home, recovered, and never entered the statistics.” Seen in this light, the actual number of cases is even higher that we know of, which means the mortality rate is even lower. No. For patients infected by a severe form of the disease, doctors try to ensure that they don’t catch any further infections or respiratory complications. On the other hand, the genetic sequence of the Wuhan virus was detected in record time, and several possible vaccines are being developed in China, the US, and Australia. Given the time needed to do tests, however, these vaccines will probably come too late. In Switzerland, where no case has yet been recorded, pharmacies have sold out of these masks, as in other countries. Some are selling them online for jacked-up prices. However, the masks are only really useful for people already ill, to prevent them passing it on to others. As all health authorities, including the WHO, keep saying, the top precaution is to wash your hands, very well. From the medieval plague to Ebola, humans have always been terrified of plagues that threaten to wipe us all out. And from Hieronymus Bosch to Stephen King, not to mention the various creators of apocalyptic books, films, and series, humans have also always liked to dramatise the threat, like children who get a kick from scaring themselves. The last overview by the WHO (on January 31) outlined 9,826 confirmed cases in the world, and 213 deaths – all of these in China. In newsrooms, including that of swissinfo.ch, the question is always there: caught between a responsibility to inform and the risk of causing undue panic, how much importance should we give to such news? On social media, in contrast, disinformation and hysteria abound, often without any such reflection. SARS disappeared after one year, having caused 800 deaths; MERS is still at large and has to date led to 838 fatalities.

2020-01-31;Switzerland hopes to repatriate citizens from China at the weekend;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_switzerland-hopes-to-repatriate-citizens-from-china-at-the-weekend/45531018;Switzerland hopes to begin repatriating its citizens from China at the weekend but cannot yet give guarantees for the ten people who have asked to return home, the Swiss authorities said in a press conference on Friday. France has offered to fly the ten people to Marseilles where they will be quarantined for 14 days when they arrive. Officials said that all Swiss citizens in China are healthy and reiterated that there are no cases of Coronavirus in Switzerland so far. The Swiss foreign ministry said there are more than 4,000 Swiss nationals in China and Hong Kong at present. But only ten are located in the vicinity of Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic that has so far claimed 213 lives. Also on Friday, the Touring Club Switzerland said that it was in contact with the foreign ministry and had already organised 16 return flights from China for its members, including from regions that are less affected.  It has also created a special team to deal with the situation and the increased number of calls from members. Some media reports have criticisedExternal link the Swiss authorities for what they see as a slow response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has now been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). But Swiss health officials sought to calm fears by saying that the country is prepared if the virus should appear in Switzerland. The federal authorities are closely coordinating with cantonal counterparts, whilst Switzerland has been included in a European Union-wide warning system. Researchers at the University of Bern have warned that there is a risk of the Coronavirus epidemic spreading outside of China. Using computer simulations, they have concluded that each infected person spreads the virus to two other people on average. This is a similar ratio to the 2003 SARS virus, researchers say. There are already more cases of Coronavirus than the SARS epidemic. “At the moment it is essential to prevent new transmission chains from forming in countries outside of China,” said epidemiologist Christian Althaus. “The stringent measures taken in China to prevent further spread have most likely depressed the number of reproductions. The following weeks will show whether these measures are sufficient to prevent a global pandemic.” This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-01-30;How a Swiss-Chinese family returned to Wuhan;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus-_how-a-swiss-chinese-family-returned-to-wuhan/45529230;"When the coronavirus spread in China, one Swiss expat and his family were on a short holiday in Hong Kong. From there, they returned to their home in Wuhan, the epicentre of the health crisis. They shared their experience of travelling to the city earlier this week. Fears are running high globally due to the coronavirus originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Zhou Xianwang, the city’s mayor, estimatedExternal link last week that up to five million people had left the metropolis of 11 million residents since the outbreak.   But one Swiss man and his family, who currently reside in Wuhan, decided to go the other way.  Emmanuel Mathias Geebelen, 42, is a stay-at-home father originally from Geneva. His wife Connie, 28, is a Chinese national from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. She leads a kindergarten. They moved to the city in April 2019 with their son Nikola; their youngest, Nikita, was born soon after they arrived.  The Swiss embassy in Beijing said it had eight citizens registered in Wuhan before the outbreak; about half chose to stay put. Geebelen said he had not registered and didn’t count among those eight.  The family decided to take a trip to Hong Kong during the annual Lunar New Year holidays. Like most other Chinese households, the family had planned their trip months ahead.   They decided to stay on Lamma, a small island in Hong Kong that is home to an alternative scene and feels a world away from city life. With no vehicles on the island, it has a close-knit community with quirky bars and restaurants. Geebelen lived there after leaving Switzerland in 2013 and remembers the lifestyle fondly. A keen hiker, he has hiked many trails in Hong Kong and had previously backpacked around the world.  The government then placed Wuhan and most of the province on lockdown following the outbreak of the virus.   The family considered staying put. Geebelen could have stayed because of his Swiss passport, but visas for Connie, Nikola and Nikita – all Chinese nationals – were due to expire. A growing number of possible alternative travel destinations refused to accept Wuhan residents.  They knew the journey back was going to be more difficult. The flight back to Xiangyang Airport, near Wuhan, had been cancelled because of the outbreak.  The family received a refund, but they knew they had to change their plans quickly before other means of transport also become unavailable. They decided to take a train and see whether they could get off at Wuhan.  “It’s a gamble, but we don’t have any other choice,” Connie said. “We don’t have any backup plans. Nobody can help; it’s quite a desperate situation.”  She said they were worried about their children. “I do my best to look after them and I’m quite confident they’ll be OK,” she said.  On Tuesday the four finally ventured back to Wuhan. That day, there were 6,081 cases confirmed with 132 fatalities.  When they bought the train ticket online, they were not able to buy a ticket to the Chinese city. The sales assistant did not even know whether trains would stop in the city. So they bought a ticket for the stop before Wuhan, a town called Yueyang.   They had booked themselves into business class. Their compartment filled up, but the rest of the train stayed eerily empty. Geebelen said he checked other compartments and couldn’t find other passengers.  But they were lucky and could travel on from Yueyang. “We asked somebody inside the train [for tickets] to Wuhan, and they allowed us to buy them,” he said.   The journey took over four hours. The carriages were almost empty, almost like a ghost train. As they arrived in the city, it was like nothing they’d seen before.  “There’s no one here, everything’s closed,” Geebelen said, recalling their arrival at the usually buzzing central train station.  “When you go to the central place for the disease, they don’t care anymore,” he said. “It’s like going to war: once you’re inside, that’s it,” Geebelen joked drily. He said he saw health checks at other stations and on major roads.  Outside of Wuhan Station, there was barely a traveller in sight. This time of the year, the frenzy reaches its peak as travellers return after the traditional Lunar New Year gatherings.   But not this year. “Ninety-nine per cent of my work colleagues had to cancel their trip,” Connie said. “They have had to stay indoors during the New Year.” Officials had advised people to stay at home. Shops were closed. Buses and the subway are halted.   Friends picked up the family by car and drove them to their flat. The roads were almost empty apart from some checkpoints, Geebelen said. No one is certain when normal life will resume.  Upon arrival, they first went to the only supermarket open in their vicinity. It had been ordered to stay open by the authorities. All other shops were shut, Geebelen said. They filled their freezer with meat and fish, expecting to stay isolated for weeks.   At home, they wash their hands in alcohol to disinfect and are extra careful with food deliveries. “The children are both fine but feel pretty bored to stay home all day,” Connie said. She too will face boredom since the provincial government ordered a temporary halt to all business until at least February 13.  But Geebelen insisted: “Worried? no! It doesn’t make a difference.” He also said he was convinced the government was taking all the necessary steps to contain the disease.  They are planning to stay put even though the Swiss authorities are exploring options to evacuate the remaining nationals from Wuhan. But getting to Switzerland is also getting harder. Swiss International Air Lines and its parent company Lufthansa have suspended flights to and from China.  But Geebelen is adamant he will stay. “We’re staying here,” he said. “There’s no way we’re putting ourselves at risk again.”  This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-01-30;WHO experts worry as coronavirus spreads beyond China;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/virus-outbreak_switzerland-seeks-to-evacuate-its-nationals-from-coronavirus-epicentre/45525746;The spread of the new coronavirus from China to other parts of the world has triggered concern at the World Health Organization (WHO) and caused Swiss International Airlines and other carriers to suspend flights to the Asian nation. Addressing journalists in Geneva on Wednesday after their return from China, WHO officials praised China and their leaders’ efforts to combat the new coronavirus.  I was very encouraged and impressed by President Xi Jinping's detailed knowledge of the outbreak and his personal involvement in the outbreak, this for me is real leadership , WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared.  However, the speed and extent that the virus has spreadExternal link, as well as person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus in three other countries - Germany, Vietnam and Japan - is worrying.  There have been 7,711 cases of the flu-like virus in China, and 170 deaths, Chinese health authorities said late on Wednesday. The virus is now recorded in every region in the country. It has also spread to 16 countries worldwide. Around 70 cases have been reported outside China - according to the latest WHO figures. Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak, said Tedros. WHO will therefore reconvene its Emergency Committee on Thursday, the third time in a week, to evaluate whether the coronavirus outbreak now constitutes an international emergency. If they do so, this would lead to a boost in public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.  Meanwhile, Swiss authorities are exploring options to evacuate nationals keen to leave the quarantine city of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China. This follows evacuation announcements by various nations, including Japan, Germany and the United States.  The Swiss Embassy in Beijing is in regular contact with Swiss nationals who are known to be in quarantined areas, including those who want to leave the country. On Thursday, Swiss public television (RTS)External link reported that 12 people in Wuhan were in touch with the embassy, both Swiss and some foreign spouses. “The foreign ministry is in touch with various states in order to organize a possible evacuation,” foreign ministry spokesman Pierre-Alain Eltschinger told swissinfo.ch.  The Swiss embassy in China had registered eight Swiss citizens in Hubei province who live in the city of Wuhan, the Swiss foreign ministry had said on Sunday. At the time, half of them were no longer present and the others preferred to stay in the city.   Fabienne Blaser, a student from Bern currently in Wuhan, told Swiss public televisionExternal link (SRF) that she was effectively under quarantine in the city and that the university required students to take their temperatures every day and send in the results online.  She said that she would like Swiss embassy assistance to leave the country. In an interview in the German language paper TagesAnzeiger,External link Blaser said that she had reached out the embassy on Tuesday but there was no new information.  A US government official told Reuters a US charter plane had left Wuhan with 220 people aboard, including 50 diplomats and contractors. The city of 11 million in the province of Hubei is in virtual lockdown and much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is under some kind of travel curb.  The limited number of airlines willing to fly to China may complicate evacuation efforts.  Swiss International Airlines (SWISS) and its parent company Lufthansa announced on Wednesday their decision to suspend flights to and from China due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. “For operational reasons, booking acceptance for flights to China (mainland) has stopped until the end of February,” Lufthansa said on Wednesday.  Hong Kong will continue to be served as planned. Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines are flying to their destinations in China one last time on Thursday so that passengers there and the crews can return to Germany, Switzerland and Austria.  “We have cancelled 32 flights with approximately 4,000 passengers. SWISS will rebook the passengers concerned free of charge on other airlines,” SWISS spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott told swissinfo.ch, confirming that flights to Beijing and Shanghai are suspended until February 9. A number of other airlines, including American Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to mainland China as deaths from the fast-spreading new virus leapt from 26 to 133 and the first cases emerged in the Middle East.  By Wednesday afternoon, 50 suspected cases of the coronavirus had been analysed in Switzerland. Daniel Dauwalder from the Federal Office of Public Health confirmed that all the cases were negative. The office did not give details on the cases, specifically which cantons the cases were from. However, Keystone news agency reported that a 47-year-old man is in an isolation room in the Einsiedeln hospital, about 40 kilometres from Zurich, because of suspected coronavirus. He had been at the Hong Kong airport for a few hours on January 24th. This was confirmed by a hospital spokesperson according to Keystone.  On Tuesday morning the all-clear had been given for two people that had been quarantined with suspected cases in the Triemli Hospital in Zurich. There are currently no confirmed cases of infection with the novel corona virus in Switzerland.  Dauwalder did not indicate how many cases were still being analysed but noted that the process is ongoing. The health office has set up a hotline to answer questions from the public: +41 (0)58 463 00 00. Cultural events will also be affected. For example, of eight Chinese dancers scheduled to compete at this weekend's Prix de Lausanne ballet competition, three are now unable to participate. Meanwhile, art insiders are concerned about how the coronavirus might affect the Art Basel Hong Kong edition in March. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-01-29;Swiss scientists discover ‘antiviral’ powers of sugar;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/medical-advances_swiss-scientists-discover--antiviral--powers-of-sugar/45525236;Swiss and British researchers have modified sugar molecules so that they are capable, by simple contact, of destroying viruses, without toxicity to humans. The method could apply, for example, to the new coronavirus in China. So-called virucidal substances, such as bleach, destroy viruses by simple contact, but they cannot be applied to the human body without causing serious damage, noted the University of Geneva (UNIGE) in a statement. Most of today's antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the growth of viruses but are incapable of destroying them. Complicating matters, they are not always reliable: viruses can mutate and become resistant to such treatments. To get around these two obstacles and be able to effectively fight against viral infections, we found an entirely different angle of attack , stresses Caroline Tapparel Vu, a professor in the department of microbiology and molecular medicine of UNIGE who led the research effort along  with Francesco Stellacci, a professor at the faculty of engineering sciences and techniques of the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EPFL). Researchers had previously produced a gold-based antiviral. Applying the same concept, they have this time succeeded in developing an antiviral using natural glucose derivatives, called cyclodextrins, according to an article published in the journal Science Advances. The advantages of cyclodextrins are numerous: even more biocompatible than gold, and easier to use. They do not trigger a resistance mechanism and are not toxic, said Samuel Jones, a researcher at the University of Manchester who was cited in the UNIGE press release. In addition, cyclodextrins are already widely used, particularly in the food industry, which would facilitate the marketing of pharmaceutical treatments using them, notes Valeria Cagno of UNIGE. The modified sugar molecules attract viruses before irreversibly inactivating them. By disrupting the outer layer of the virus, they manage to destroy infectious particles by simple contact, instead of only blocking viral growth. And this mechanism seems to work regardless of the virus concerned. Scientists have been able to demonstrate this on viruses responsible for respiratory and herpes infections. A patent has been filed and a spin-off created to study the pharmaceutical development that could be made with this discovery. The cyclodextrins could be administered as a cream, gel or nasal spray. While drugs for specific viruses, such as HIV or hepatitis C, exist, they only have a narrow application. The development of new broad-spectrum antivirals is considered essential, especially to tackle the most devastating viruses or emerging viruses against which there is no treatment. This work, according to the authors, could then have a global impact. The compound may also be effective against new emerging viruses the novel coronavirus that started in China and spread overseas.

2020-01-28;Health office confirms no cases of coronavirus in Switzerland;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus_swiss-tighten-rules-to-help-stop-spread-of-china-virus/45518156;"Two patients quarantined in Zurich do not have the coronavirus, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has confirmed. The two people had been kept in isolation at the Triemli hospital in Zurich at the weekend after returning from a trip to China and showing signs of an infection which could have been linked to the coronavirus outbreak.   The negative test results were announced on Tuesday. “All samples analysed have shown to be negative,” Daniel Koch, head of transmissible diseases at FOPH, told reporters in Bern. The federal authorities are in permanent contact with the cantonal authorities.  The Triemli hospital also announced on Tuesday morning that the two patients in quarantine were well and confirmed that they did not have the virus. Doctors and laboratories must now report suspected cases of coronavirus infection to the cantonal and federal authorities within two hours. Koch said FOPH is also setting up a hotline to help answer the public’s questions about coronavirus. Swiss Home Affairs Minister Alain Berset has declared that Switzerland is well prepared to face any outbreak of coronavirus and is ready to support international efforts to prevent a pandemic.  At the international level the situation remains confused and in constant evolution. The coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, has killed 106 people in China and infected more than 4,520 globally, most of them in China. Thailand and Hong Kong have each reported eight cases of infection; the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Macau have five each; Japan, South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; France three; Vietnam and Canada two each, and one each in Germany, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Cambodia. No fatalities have been reported outside China. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is currently in China for meetings with Chinese officials including President Xi Jinping and State Councillor Wang Yi. China says the WHO chief approves of the Chinese government's measures to curb the outbreak and is against evacuations. Tedros said the WHO does not advocate for countries to evacuate their citizens from China, adding there was no need to overreact, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. He said the WHO is confident in China's ability to prevent and control the epidemic. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-01-28;Coronavirus expected to hit Swiss tourism industry;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/coronavirus----_chinese-virus-expected-to-hit-swiss-tourism-industry/45520372;Swiss officials say the coronavirus outbreak could result in a 30-50% reduction in the number of Chinese tourists visiting the Alpine country in the coming weeks.  The coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, has killed 106 people in China so far. Among measures to contain the virus, China is halting all group holiday tours, affecting tourism both at home and to other countries, from January 27.  Winter is not peak season for Chinese visitors coming to Switzerland but tourism officials nonetheless expect the virus outbreak to have an impact.  “In the coming weeks, Switzerland Tourism expects a 30-50% reduction in the number of Chinese visitors to Switzerland,” spokesperson Véronique Kanel told Keystone-SDA on Monday. Based on 2018 figures, this could represent 70,000-100,000 overnight stays per month.  Chinese visitors are among the biggest spenders when holidaying in Switzerland: paying out on average CHF380 per person per day.  As group tours are mainly affected by the freeze on reservations and travel, popular Swiss destinations such as Geneva, Zermatt, Interlaken, Lucerne and Zurich will feel the effects, Kanel said.  Reactions were mixed among other tourism officials. Michael Maeder, director general of Switzerland Travel Centre, said the busy Chinese holiday period in Switzerland only really starts in April, so the recent freeze on group tours had not been felt. Chinese groups represent 3-4% of their annual turnover and two groups had already cancelled for this week, he said.  “Depending on the length of the ban, it may have an influence on our business, as clients may make other plans when the ban is lifted,” he said.  Nicolas Meylan, director general of Mövenpick Hotel and Casino Genève, also felt it was too early to weigh up any impact. Chinese visitors represent 5-6% of the Swiss hotel group’s clients.  Meanwhile, Swiss International Airlines (SWISS) said it had registered an increased number of cancellations due to the virus outbreak, without giving any details.  According to Switzerland’s Federal Statistical Office, over two-thirds of the 1.73 million overnight hotel stays recorded in 2018 by visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, were made during the May-October period.

2020-01-23;Swiss develop test to detect coronavirus ;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mysterious-virus-_swiss-develop-test-to-detect-coronavirus--/45513600;"The University Hospitals of Geneva have developed a test to detect a new strain of the coronavirus which is spreading across the world from China. The World Health Organization (WHO) decided on Thursday that the outbreak was not a global health emergency, but deemed it a local crisis. It said however, that the situation may yet turn into an emergency. Until now, the WHO has only declared international public health emergencies in rare cases, such as for the swine flu pandemic of 2009, the Zika outbreak in 2016 and the Ebola virus (part of Western Africa in 2014; Republic of Congo since 2018).  This new strain of the coronavirus has so far killed at least 25 people and infected more than 800, the Chinese government said on Friday. It is now present in around half of the Chinese provinces, including the huge cities of Beijing and Shanghai. In all, 18 cities have been shut down in Hubei province, of which Wuhan, the source of the virus, is the capital. Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia and the United States. Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which beginson Saturday. Experts say there are two particularly worrying points about this virus: human-to-human transmission, which has been confirmed by a Swiss researcher, and the fact that the virus can easily mutate and defend itself. Around ten days ago the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) developed a test for the virus that can rapidly detect whether people are contagious. “The virus has been identified; we have its full genetic code,” Laurent Kaiser, head of the  Division of Infectious Diseases at the HUG, told Swiss public television, RTSExternal link. The test is very simple: a swab is taken from the back of the throat or from the nose with a cotton bud. It would be applied to people coming back from China who present cold-like symptoms that include coughing, fever, muscular pain and breathing difficulties. “If the symptoms are limited, patients will receive the usual care. Our worry is that patients develop pneumonia,” Kaiser said, adding that at present there is no vaccine or treatment against this new virus. The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. Most transport in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was suspended on Thursday and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about seven million people, announced a similar lockdown.  Kaiser says the virus is “70% similar to SARS”. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an atypical form of pneumonia, infected around 8,000 and killed 774 in 2002-2003.  “We have all the elements and ingredients which could cause big epidemics in some countries,” he told RTS.  Finding a vaccine will take years, but for now it’s not clear whether the virus will persist among humans. “The epidemic could also disappear as quickly as it appeared,” Kaiser said.  Several countries, including the US, have upped monitoring measures at airports for travellers coming back from Wuhan province. However, Chinese authorities have now banned flights from the region.  “Although there are air connections from Wuhan to Europe (London, Paris and Rome), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control judgesExternal link the risk of importation as moderate, also for Switzerland,” the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health said in a statementExternal link on Thursday.  There is no need at the moment to take measures in Switzerland like those seen in southeastern Asian countries, the statement continued.  Switzerland is “very well prepared” said Swiss Home Affairs Minister Alain Berset at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday. The country is also ready to support international efforts against a pandemic, as it did during the Ebola crisis, he said. ​​​​​​​ This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2020-01-22;Swiss offer help to combat spread of coronavirus;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/health_swiss-offer-help-to-combat-spread-of-coronavirus/45510514;Interior Minister Alain Berset says Switzerland is well prepared to face an outbreak of coronavirus and is ready to support international efforts to prevent a pandemic. Speaking at the sidelines of the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Berset said there was a contingency plan that could be implemented in case of a pandemic of the respiratory illness discovered in China earlier this month. Berset, whose portfolio includes health matters, said Switzerland was ready to help international efforts to contain the virus. “Switzerland, which hosts the headquarters of the WHO [World Health Organization], is not indifferent to the situation,” Berset said. He met the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday, as well as the health ministers from Brazil and the Netherlands and the executive director of UN Women, the United Nations agency dedicated to promoting gender equality. Meanwhile, a panel of experts on disease control, virology and vaccine development are meeting at the WHO headquarters in Geneva to evaluate whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes an international emergency. The virus has spread beyond China’s borders, raising concerns of a global pandemic. A first case of the illness was confirmed by United States officials on Tuesday. The death toll in China from the infection had risen to at least 17 by Wednesday. This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2016-02-06;‘Zika’s weak point is the mosquito’;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/epidemic-_-zika-s-weak-point-is-the-mosquito/41942634;What does the decision to declare the Zika virus a global health crisis mean for Switzerland? swissinfo.ch asked Marcel Tanner, epidemiologist and former head of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel. In past decades the world has worried about the Ebola virus, polio and swine fever. Now the latest “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” declared by the World Health Organisation is called Zika. WHO is concerned about the presumed link – strongly suspected, though there is still no scientific proof – between the virus and birth defects (microcephaly) in newborns. swissinfo.ch: What does the WHO alert mean for Switzerland? Marcel Tanner: It means that Switzerland too has to be concerned about the problem. This means monitoring at national level, but also getting involved in international efforts to contain the epidemic. It is important to understand that this is not a problem that concerns just Brazil. Travellers need to be appropriately informed. They need to know that, for the time being, there are no vaccines or medicines available. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the only solution is to keep them away with repellents and nets. Swiss hospitals dealing with fevers, in particular with people just back from Latin America, need to consider the Zika virus as one of the possibilities. But let’s be careful: we must avoid any hysteria. In 80% of cases, infection with Zika is asymptomatic. swissinfo.ch: The tiger mosquito, one of the potential carriers of the virus, is now present in the southern Alps, in canton Ticino. Do we need to worry about that? M. T.: The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is responsible for monitoring populations of tiger mosquitoes in Switzerland. If they should expand, or if any changes should be observed, the government will be informed. The Federal Office of Public Health will then go into action with measures to control mosquitoes. They may target sites favourable for these insects breeding. This is our contribution to the worldwide effort. In the tiger mosquitoes we have studied, we have found no Zika virus. But if the mosquitoes were in contact with an infected patient from Brazil, they could in theory transmit the virus to other humans. I think that an unlikely scenario, particularly now in the winter. swissinfo.ch: What questions do we need to find an answer to as fast as possible? M. T.: What has alarmed the international community is the comorbidity aspect [more than one disease occurring in the same patient], with the appearance of microcephaly in newborns of infected women. It had never happened before in this form. There are reported to be about 4,000 cases. The correlation between Zika and these birth defects is not 100% sure. It might be due to other factors, such as genetic ones. But it is imperative that we investigate any causal relation with focused studies. This will take several months, probably. What with the Olympics in Brazil, we will have to develop specific tests to diagnose the virus quickly. I am sure that in the past many cases of dengue fever, a virus belonging to the same family, were in fact attributable to Zika. swissinfo.ch: Have there been other situations where relatively harmless viruses have triggered serious disease outbreaks? M. T.: Certainly – just think of some of the influenza viruses. We know that some can get particularly dangerous. There are also the coronaviruses: some of them are harmless, others can cause serious illnesses like SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome]. The appearance of major pathologies can be linked to mutations of the virus, but also just to the genetic features of the host. The general health of people infected – I am thinking of nutrition, say – may also be a factor. swissinfo.ch: Some public health experts believe that the Zika epidemic is worse than the Ebola. This is a silent infection which strikes a highly vulnerable group of individuals, namely pregnant women. Do you concur with this assessment? M. T.: No. With Ebola, all the body fluids are infectious. We saw that in West Africa: the capacity of Ebola to spread was enormous, unless we reacted. With the Zika virus, however, one infected patient cannot infect others*. There has to be a carrier, the mosquito. This is precisely its weak point, and we know how to fight it. swissinfo.ch: How? M. T.: By focussing on controlling mosquitoes. Brazil already had success that way with dengue fever. For the Zika virus we need to see the same kind of effort, like the 220,000 soldiers mobilised by the Brazilian government. Good systems of monitoring are needed. But we need not just to observe, but to intervene. Once we have identified a case, there is need to get to the location where the infection seems to have happened and fight the mosquitoes there. Everywhere in the world that mosquitoes live or can survive, we need to be vigilant. swissinfo.ch: What other viruses are there that could yet become an international threat? M. T.: Although these epidemics have now been contained, we should not forget SARS and MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus]. We know of about 1,300 infectious diseases, and 800 of them are carried by other species. We can’t afford to let down our guard. That means national public health programmes, ongoing monitoring, getting the right information out to the people, and also exchanging information and close collaboration between human and veterinary medicine. I think that, in general, researchers should be asked to focus more on what are classified as rare, emerging and re-emerging diseases. The microcephaly cases in Brazil are terrible. But they are not so significant if we think of some of the other health problems around. Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, just to mention a few, cause much more in the way of deaths and suffering. *This interview was held before a case of sexually transmitted Zika virus became known in the US.

2003-04-30;Roche races to produce Sars test;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/roche-races-to-produce-sars-test/3288644;Scientists worldwide are racing to produce quick, cheap and easy tests for the deadly Sars virus. Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Roche, announced earlier this week that it was hoping to launch a diagnostic test for the virus by the end of July. Meanwhile, German biotech company, Artus, is already distributing a new high-speed test which it says can confirm the presence of the disease in two hours. Traditional tests for antibodies take more than ten days.Researchers in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Vietnam have also taken up the challenge.The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the news saying the search for reliable, large-scale tests is important to help curb the spread of the disease. Quarantine Roche, the world's biggest diagnostics group, said on Monday it was trying to develop test kits and drugs to treat the flu-like illness. We are developing now a Sars-specific test. We believe this will be developed by the middle of June and will be on the market by the end of July, said spokesman Alexander Klauser.The WHO has welcomed the prospect of standardized tests, which would make it possible to test many samples in a short space of time. They are absolutely essential in controlling these outbreaks, said WHO spokesman Dick Thompson. They are a way of identifying quickly who is infected and needs to be isolated from perhaps thousands of people who are not infected but who are in isolation or quarantine. Tests can also give health authorities insight into when patients are most infectious and when is the best time to administer drugs, he said. Large-scale tests Sars has killed at least 326 people and infected more than 5,000 since it broke out in China's Guangdong province late last year before spreading to dozens of countries.The search for reliable, large-scale tests that can quickly detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome has been more difficult than first imaginedKlauser said the diagnostic test would be based on Roche's polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR acts as a kind of genetic copying machine that lets scientists detect even minute samples of genetic material.Roche has been collecting Sars samples from hundreds of infected people across Asia in a bid to rush out a test kit for the disease.It announced earlier this month that it was gathering stool and sputum samples from state-run hospitals in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia.Roche said it was too early to give any guidance about the market potential for the test. It is also examining whether it could develop a drug to treat the flu-like illness, but needed more information about the virus, Klauser said. Quick and cheap Thompson said tests for Sars already exist, but they are mostly made by hand, so only a few hundred can be conducted in a day. To perform tests on a large scale, they needed to be developed by the private sector, he added. What is important is that these are easily done, that they can be done without expensive equipment, and that they are cheap, he added.He also noted that PCR tests can generally be used shortly after infection, unlike some antibody tests that may not work until 20 days down the line. The tests detect the strain of the coronavirus which has been found in patients suffering from Sars and is now widely thought to cause the disease. Further testing Hamburg-based Artus says its test can detect the virus from throat swabs, sputum or faeces, and produces results in two hours.Samples of the test will be shipped out for further evaluation by specialist laboratories around the world.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States expect to have a product ready soon, while Abbott Laboratories, another of the world's largest makers of diagnostic tests, is finalising an agreement with an undisclosed firm to distribute a test. The Genome Institute of Singapore says it has a three-hour test in the final stages of completion, and the National Institute of Health and Epidemiology in Hanoi, Vietnam, has developed a six-hour test.Researchers at Laval University hospital in Quebec City say they have a prototype ready to test for Sars. Prodesse, a biotech company from Waukesha, Wisconsin, expects to have a test ready by mid to late May.swissinfo, Vincent Landon This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

2003-04-09;Sars epidemic no cause for panic, say doctors;https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sars-epidemic-no-cause-for-panic--say-doctors/3256216;Swiss doctors are playing down fears that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars, constitutes a major threat to the population. The medical corps says the atypical pneumonia that originated in China and has killed over 100 people around the world is no worse than other viral diseases. Sars is far from being a major killer, said Giorgio Zanetti, an infectious diseases specialist at Lausanne University Hospital. Only ten per cent of all cases are serious and just three to five patients out of 100 will die from it. Switzerland has so far remained unscathed by Sars. Only one probable case has been registered with the authorities, and there are currently six other possible ones. False alarm Seven other cases have been dismissed as false alarms. This did not stop the federal health authorities, fearing a spread of the disease, from banning some Asian countries from exhibiting at the important Basel watch fair.Zanetti says it is difficult to say why some people die. We have to assume their immune system was too weak or they waited too long for treatment, he told swissinfo.Elderly people, who are already weakened or in bad health seem to be most vulnerable to Sars, as they are to influenza. But Zanetti warns this is not a proven fact.The specialist says the biggest difficulty for doctors at the moment is the lack of a specific test for the disease. We can only eliminate the other possibilities, he said. We don't know what the virus looks like exactly, even if we are close to identifying it. Treatment Treatment is restricted for the time being to dealing with the symptoms associated with mild cases of Sars, such as fever and joint pain. In more severe cases, doctors can give patients help with their breathing.Although there is no great risk to the population, Zanetti says the Swiss must not let their guard down. You cannot tell how the epidemic will evolve, he told swissinfo.He added that while information about the disease has been disseminated quickly and health authorities around the world have reacted, Sars has still not been contained. It is very difficult to stop the disease from spreading, as the Canadians have found out, he said. But it could be that preventive measures may suffice to eradicate it for the time being. Search for a vaccine In the meantime, the hunt for a vaccine to ward off the virus is already being considered in Switzerland and abroad.However, Berna Biotech, a Swiss vaccine specialist, is waiting for the virus to be properly identified before launching a research and development programme. We are keeping an eye on how the situation develops before we make any decision on whether to go forward, said spokesman Patrik Richard. But we will be looking into the matter seriously since we are well positioned to develop a vaccine. Richard warns though that finding a vaccine could be a long process. It could take up to ten years just to develop it, he told swissinfo.Berna is a minnow among the world's healthcare companies, with a comparatively small research budget of just SFr50 million ($36 million). But the firm that develops a vaccine is likely to see its investment pay off. Governments would be willing to shell out a lot of money to buy a vaccine, said Roland Maier, a manager at investment firm BB Biotech. The effects of an epidemic on some of the world's biggest economies could be devastating if it went unchecked. Protection Maier cites as an example the recent fears of terrorist attacks using smallpox that prompted governments to stockpile vaccine. They spent several hundreds of millions of dollars to protect themselves against an uncertain threat, he told swissinfo.He adds though that until the virus responsible for Sars is properly identified, the prospect of a vaccine remains uncertain, even if developments so far are promising. The virus seems to belong to the coronavirus family, he said. While humans haven't been affected by this type of virus before, there are animal vaccines that have been developed for it. Maier reckons that if a new vaccine can be based on pre-existing one, development shouldn't take too long. Diagnostics The Sars vaccine market isn't the only one healthcare companies are considering. Swiss multinational Roche is considering the diagnostics and treatment issues related to the epidemic. We are confident we could develop a test rapidly once the virus is identified, said company spokesman Horst Kramer. If all went well, it would only take around two months. Finding a treatment for Sars will take longer though. Kramer says identifying the virus is just the first step. It can take a long time before you can find a virus' weakness, he told swissinfo. Until then, you can't start considering a treatment that interferes with the virus' life cycle and prevents it from replicating. From that point on, Kramer says it would take five to eight years to develop the treatment, at a cost of between SFr750 million and SFr1 billion.swissinfo, Scott Capper and Marc-André Miserez This article was automatically imported from our old content management system.
